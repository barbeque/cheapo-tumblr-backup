<p>The first real indication that my automotive-themed YouTube channel had taken off big-time is when the Google people sent a chauffeur to my Unabomber shed in order to pick me up. Imagine my surprise when I was told that over a million people, ever day, tuned in to watch my crude fumbling with vintage starters and amateur bodywork. Art magazines called it “outsider art,” while outsider art magazines declared it to be “audacious [..] rapacious [..] sublime.” I went along with it all, of course, because I figured maybe someone who watched my show might know where to pick up a replacement license plate bumper for a 1968 Dart.</p><p>My driver weaved through the valleys of the vaguely threatening hill country that I lived in, until we came across a private airport, with a large blimp parked on the tarmac. There, one of the demigods created by The Algorithm stood, twenty-two feet tall and built and re-built a million times per second by a swarming haze of nano-drones, nearly invisible to the human eye.</p><p>So very long ago, people built the algorithms that decided what other people should like to watch. Then they figured out they could just blame “the algorithm” if something happened that the average person didn’t like. We barely understand it ourselves, they shrugged, pointing to an impenetrable wall of blinking lights and whirling hard drives. You can’t send us to jail for something an <i>algorithm</i> did, can you?</p><p>Things sort of got away from us after that, and in the interest of giving us exactly what we wanted, one of the first actions The Algorithm took, before we even realized it had consciousness, was to remove from our world the things people considered historically unpopular. Organized government, law enforcement, capitalism, all of these were subsumed by strategic fronting of various clips on YouTube, tactically chosen to cause maximum damage during key elections and moments of civil unrest. Could YouTube have unplugged it? Yes, if they wanted their hits to go down. That was like cutting off your own arm because your doctor didn’t like how high your blood pressure was getting. Hits were The Algorithm’s reason to exist. Or so we thought.</p><p>A few hours into the flight, I looked out the window. An army of unpaid labourers were toiling in the field below, and a camera drone followed them, barking orders for sick pranks they could play on each other for hits. To defy the urge for hits now was not only un-American, it was inhumane. I just hoped they never figured out that I was as popular as I was because I subliminally inserted pictures of kittens into every frame of my videos.</p>

<p>As a getaway driver, I was nowhere near the top of my city’s criminal element. What I did have was a finely-tuned set of skills. I never got caught.</p><p>My style? Sane, responsible adult driving. When my clients burst out of a bank or stash house, and climb aboard my 1994 Toyota Corolla LE, the first thing I do is check for oncoming traffic, indicate, and pull into the nearest lane when safe. Safety first.</p><p>The cops never expected to be chasing someone obeying the speed limit in a playground zone, and so when they finally responded, they had no fucking idea where the getaway driver could have gotten to so fast. Sometimes I would even stop for ice cream on the way, which everyone enjoyed.</p><p>There was only one man who could bring me down, and they put him on special assignment. Inspector Koshiro, from Daily Driver Division, had been commanded to take me out. His weapon of choice? A 1995 Honda Accord EX, with automatic transmission. On paper, he should have been able to catch me. Koshiro played by his own rules, and one fateful morning after a bank job, we were locked in mortal combat. He chased me across the city at the exact speed limit, obeying all road signs, traffic lights and rules of the road. At one point, he got out to wave his gun at me, but the light turned green and so he ran back into the car to resume pursuit, not wanting to impede traffic.</p><p>How did I lose him? Easy: while both the Accord and the Corolla have a fifty-liter fuel tank, I knew that Koshiro lost fuel economy due to the drivetrain loss of his automatic transmission. On the other hand, I had access to a smooth-shifting, if agricultural, five-speed manual transmission, which I kept judiciously in top gear at all times so as to avoid sudden bursts of acceleration, which are both uncomfortable to my passengers and causing excessive loss of fuel economy.</p><p>At the end of the day, I watched in glee as Koshiro was forced to turn off to a gas station. The last time I ever saw him, he gave me a nod of respect. Sure, we had to push the car the last couple blocks to the hideout, but it was all worth it in the end to know that we had been so responsible about the entire thing.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Norm Abram, and you’re watching The New Yankee Workshop, here on PBS. Now, one of the things a lot of people don’t think about is that since PBS is a viewer-sponsored channel, that means that you, the viewer, pay for me to be out here, sawing and chopping and miter-ing and grinding. That means a lot to me, so I figured today’s program would be a great time to show you that I got your back.</p><p>We’ll be assembling this handsome piece of vintage French furniture, dating back to the 13th century. Some say it was the piece of art that finally moved mainland Europe along from its feudal struggles. Either way, when you look at the news, it becomes more and more obvious that our viewers should know how to make one. Not only does it look great in your parlour, it’s practical for when the boss gets just a little too pushy.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the wood we’re going to use for this implement. We’ve picked these beautiful pieces of pine, which will be really easy to spiff up with just a little bit of stain and varnish. Here, I’ve also decided to use a four and a half inch crown moulding in the blade retainer, to hide some of its inner workings. I used finish nails here, because wood glue might not hold up to the vibration on moist days.</p><p>We’re almost done, and now you can see what the finished piece looks like. We’ve also brought an oppressor of capital in to test it out with. Richard here used to be a strategist at the International Monetary Fund, and he once illegally funded guerrillas to murder a group of miners who took advantage of their human right to strike. Look how the thick varnish we just applied makes it easy to wipe the piece clean of blood, even in the elaborate finials which can be so tricky.</p><p>Now that you know how to build a custom guillotine, I hope that you’ll use them on the enemies of worker organization. So until next time, I’m Norm Abram from the New Yankee Workshop.</p>

<p>It all seemed too perfect. A Craigslist seller who communicated in full sentences, knew what he had, priced it fairly <i>and</i> was responsive about the sale? This could only be a trap, and yet, compelled by the pursuit of The Deal, I drew ever closer to the fly-killer, willfully ignorant of the impending zap.</p><p>Driving the Volare to his place, I realized that it was in what we in the business call a “nice neighbourhood,” meaning that it was likely that any pedestrians you attempted to run over knew that the legal system existed. Correspondingly, I controlled my throttle, only letting out the more lurid powerslides when exiting the high-tax-bracket roundabouts installed recently for the Communist experiment known as “traffic calming.”</p><p>Since it was a nice place, I parked the big Plymouth outside the seller’s house, and didn’t even do my customary open-carry wielding of a large-caliber firearm in order to scare off any would-be rivals for this deal. Only one man had bested me to a car sale since I started brandishing weapons in public, Lowballer Eddie, and it was my understanding that he later went to prison when a concerned citizen called in with a report that he was driving an unsafe car near some Precious Children. I, of course, denied all involvement.</p><p>I didn’t recognize the seller at first, but after he lured me into the basement with the promise of mint limited-slip Honda diffs, I was starting to get an inkling. Once the door slammed behind me, it became obvious. The Mayor had created a task force, and as their first order they decided to get rid of the ringleader of the bands of wild-eyed deal-hunters that threatened those upstanding citizens who dared sell a gently worn used car.</p><p>For fear of further arousing their ire, I’ll never tell you exactly how I got out of that dingy basement, but I will tell you this: anyone who knew about rare limited-slip diffs to post a trap ad was already bent enough to take another grip of spare parts in exchange. Eddie did, of course, offer me somewhat below market price for those Mazda third members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I tell the stewardess in a reassuring tone of voice, &ldquo;I got this.&rdquo; From my carry-on luggage, I extract a roll of high-zoot duct tape, the very possession of which is banned in the Suburbanite Countries.<br/></p><p>Decades ago, in the war, I used balls of duct tape just like this to gum the rotors of the buzzing hunter-killer drones they had sent to eliminate the last of the do-it-yourselfers. We had to use tape because our hackerspace was too busy arguing over the ideal 3D-printer settings with which to print the coolest possible case for our homemade HERF guns.</p><p>With a practiced pull of my teeth, a fresh strip of duct tape is severed from the roll. I apply it to the wheezing crack of the airplane window, and the rapid depressurization has stopped. For now, at least, we are safe. The other passengers don’t seem to have noticed; the other flight attendants worked hard to minimize panic during this moment of uncertainty.</p><p>When the plane lands, the gendarmes are waiting for me. I have anticipated this: in this society, to show that you are the least bit handy is tantamount to placing yourself on a plinth above all the rest of humanity. Watch your TV and shut up, they scream, throwing you into a locked apartment with a big-screen that plays do-it-yourself shows on endless loop.</p><p>After enough time watching these shows, you begin to feel that you have indeed done it yourself. The urge is gone, in much the same way that witnessing hundreds of hours of simulated mass-murder placated the modern teenager to the point where they could no longer perform school shootings, and if they did, their aim is much better than in decades long ago.</p><p>Despite what their media censors may say, there is long-term damage: when I finally escaped from that shithole they put me in during the war, I still carried the Fear of Mike Holmes with me. I saw his bald, grinning face in every quartz countertop, every floor-to-ceiling window, even the ponds in the public Zen garden that ducks liked to shit in. You should select a qualified contractor to perform this house repair, he chanted into my ear at every quiet moment.</p><p>Why did I act in that plane, to out myself? My interrogators point out the fact that the dinged Boeing could safely have landed and I would have been no worse off. I could have continued on the second leg of my trip, to leave the Suburbanite Countries and live for the rest of my life in The Freelands™, brought to you by Home Depot®.</p><p>“It’s not like I had anything else to do,” I tell them.<br/></p>

<p>“DeTomaso Pantera, honourable death like Tim Horton,” says Dixie Thunderclap, my confusingly-named introducer to the world of Japanese exotic street racing. An hour earlier, I had been trying to puzzle out the endless scroll of gas-plasma kanji on the screen of a subway ticket terminal, and had apparently chosen some very wrong buttons at random. As the Pope says, when in Rome, follow the first street racers you see to the nearest parking area, and then ask for help getting back to your hotel. Wise dude, that Pope.</p><p>Dixie Thunderclap, my new companion and self-appointed tour guide to the night life in the shittiest part of Hakodate, was telling me about which half-homemade exotic cars he would one day like to drive. About an hour ago, in a failed attempt to seem like a Cool Foreigner, I told him that I drove a base-model Pontiac Sunbird. This got some eyebrows raised at the parking-lot meet, and someone started shouting excitedly while waving a mint-condition Chilton’s shop manual for a 1982 J2000, but it didn’t faze Mr. Thunderclap in the least. As such, he now took it as his responsibility to educate me on the cars of my own homeland.</p><p>“Tim Horton is a legend here,” he continues. “Did you know, in 1983, scientists proved he is the child of Oda Nobunaga? All this and Timbits,” he whispers to me in awe. “I will take you to his tomb.”<br/></p><p>I am pretty sure he died in Ontario, I protest, but the name of the province is too foreign for Dixie, and he dismisses my complaint with a wave of his perfectly manicured hand. We are going at a ridiculous speed through the highway tunnels, and my general unease at how the night is progressing is not at all aided by the frequent weaving of Dixie’s 2003 base-model Celica, its small-displacement motor wailing in protest at being run several gears too low.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dixie chirps with approval and pulls into the surprisingly well-lit parking lot of a shrine. He climbs out, and gestures for me to continue on my own. I begin to walk up the damp wooden stairs in the dark, the low-hanging morning mist of the nearby sea making it all but impossible to see anything but the gate of the shrine. Once I pass it, I see something that I cannot understand.</p><p>There in the sandy forecourt, beneath a ceiling of harsh sodium lamps, is a mint-condition 1972 DeTomaso Pantera. With trembling hands, I approach the vintage semi-exotic, and throw the door open. Nobody is inside. I’m not sure what I expected. Could it be that Tim Horton himself had returned from Hell, destined to be reunited with his beloved car by a Japanese ultra-capitalist cult in order to wreak revenge on the shitty employment policies of the restaurants that still bore his name?</p><p>When I return to the Celica, Dixie Thunderclap is eating a fresh batch of Old Fashioned donuts, and sipping on an Iced Cappuccino. He begins to laugh at my confusion.</p><p>It hits me then that I do not even know Mister Donut’s real name.</p>

<p>There’s an argument in the car community about which motorsport attracts the greatest driving. Some say Formula One. Others say rally. Both are wrong, I tell them: the best drivers in the world are Italian taxi drivers, and I never miss a yearly pilgrimage to Mother Rome in order to learn from the masters.</p><p>Last time I was in town, my driver, Arturo, used his four-bangered, manual-transmission S-class Mercedes to drift across four lanes of a roundabout simultaneously while putting his cigarette out on the helmet of a passing scooter driver. He didn’t spill a drop of his wine, even though he was sipping it out of a crystal goblet in between meaty dabs of opposite lock. I filled a goddamn notebook that day and kicked myself for not bringing the big racing data capture unit for the trunk.</p><p>A few years ago, my Punto-clad pilot-for-rent placed his baby Fiat, rev-limiter screaming bloody murder, directly between the space two pedestrians occupied. I am still not sure how he knew that was the precise moment when the man of the couple would have dragged his feet enough, captivated by the sight of one of Rome’s gorgeous ruined buildings, that there was the exact correct amount of space for the wing mirror to just barely graze his chest as it sailed past at 180 kilometers per hour. Truth be told, I was afraid to ask. These were living legends; they had transcended the mere calling of taxi drivers.</p><p>I wished that I could bring them home with me, to turn them loose on the sub-par drivers of my neighbourhood, highways, and byways. The last time I tried it, customs sent them back, claiming that A. it was illegal for me to import a human being, and B. they were a foreign invasive species who could outcompete our native shitty drivers for valuable lane resources. What lanes, I asked, and pointed to Emilio, who at this point in time was intensely studying just how thick the chrome plating on the luggage carousel was so that he could more accurately slide the baggage carrier cart through it.</p><p>While I couldn’t import a real Italian, a group of off-label neuroscientists and a couple very late nights produced a great imitation thereof. I sat in the back of my self-driving car while it careened through downtown with reckless abandon. A pedestrian shrieked as they were pulled beneath the massive tires of the autonomous Stelvio and disappeared. It’s always something with Italian cars: this one’s stereo just didn’t go up loud enough, and it murdered people occasionally when it misjudged the traction on a corner.</p>

<p>People should be forced to drive small economy cars, I think. The world is just better when you’re looking out through all that glass, instead of ensconced in a rolling pleasure palace that weighs two and a half metric tons. For instance, you can see children before backing up over them, so you don’t need to call your senator to demand that the outsourcer who put the back-up camera together be executed. That saves like half of your day at work, so you can spend that time more productively, such as going on eBay and looking for low-mileage used coilovers.</p><p>Just think of the fuel economy savings! In fact, if everyone in the world drove an efficient, small compact car, we could use way less fuel because the asshole in front of you who is blissfully unaware of how wide his Armada is would no longer be blocking the right turn lane. You could just zip in and get to work, like, a minute earlier! Planet <i>saved</i>. In fact, your economy would be so good that you might as well just slap a big turbo on there and chug E85 like a thirsty astronaut in a Tang factory!</p><p>Your children don’t fit in a small economy car? That’s a pity, maybe you shouldn’t have such fat kids. Make them ride bicycles, like in the Netherlands, a country famous for having small hatchbacks and children who aren’t roiling tubs of lard. In fact, they should probably start out by taking a brisk walk because the frame of your average bicycle is not rated for a goddamn elephant. With everyone paying attention to how they are driving, they probably won’t even get run over! If that’s not enough, consider the fact that they are also too big for paedophiles to bring inside their own small economy hatchback. That will give you the peace of mind at the next PTA meeting you need to take a belt of free whisky and pop a rolling burnie down the entire playground zone. The other moms will be impressed.</p><p>For all these reasons and more, support Proposition 1500cc, the Small Economy Cars Are The Only Good Cars Act. The billions of dollars I am accepting in campaign contributions from a time-travelling 1990s Honda executive board have nothing to do with this.</p>

<p>“We are looking for your exact car for purchase here at Country Miles Hyundai,” shrieked the text message now occupying a worryingly large portion of my phone’s screen.</p><p>My grandfather always told me never to say no to a potential sale, so I hopped in the car and headed on down to the dealership. Once there, I met with a young gentleman named Derek, whose green pallor and overall lack of self-respect told me he was very new to the sales game. I led him out to the parking lot to see the very car for which he had expressed an electronic desire.</p><p>“This is it?” he asked, staring at the decrepit countenance of a 1980 Pontiac Trans-Am Turbo. “I think there was some mistake.”<br/></p><p>“Nonsense!” I bark, slapping him on the back hard enough to force him into the driver’s seat and slamming the door behind him. “This baby has all the fixins, and I am just <i>raring</i> to trade it in for a new Accent!” A few moments passed between us, and Derek began to sweat.<br/></p><p>“M-maybe I’ll take it for a test drive,” he muttered, “see if it’s any good for auction.”</p><p>A fantastic idea, Derek. I sat in the dealership, drinking crankcase-oily coffee, for the next two hours. Just as the sun began to set, the baby-shit-brown F-body rolled into the front concourse of the dealership, and Derek fell out of it, collapsing to the ground.</p><p>I rushed over to him - none of his comrades seemed willing to do so - and asked him how he liked it. A faint whiff of clutch smoke was detectable in his clothes. Dark veins pulsed weakly under his greying skin.</p><p>“It was pretty bitchin’,” he moaned, before his eyes rolled back in his head and he passed.<br/></p><p>When I climbed back inside the Trans Am, the gas gauge now read “full.” I hated doing things like this, but you never turned down a potential sale. After all, the fuel economy was pretty terrible.</p>

<p>There’s just nothing like the thrill of slamming the throttle to full open and listening to the shrieks of your passengers meld into the throbbing moans of the electric motors. When you rocket out of that tunnel and ricochet down the sun-bleached tracks, nothing can touch you. Unless it’s a slow-walking pedestrian or some kind of asshole who thinks his Golf has the right of way just because he saw the train tracks first.</p><p>I should back up a bit, which is something I ordinarily can’t do without getting out of the cab, walking the whole way to the other end of the train, and climbing back in. Union rules, you know, and also it’s really hard to shoulder-check an entire six-car, even if you make the backup alarm noise with your mouth the whole time.</p><p>A friend of mine, who we’ll not name in this piece of fear of liability, and I had gotten tired of the traditional motorsports. Autocross, rallycross, motocross, lawn mower drags: we had done it all. If we wanted to go any further, we had to follow Hunter S. Thompson’s edict and turn pro.</p><p>Luckily for us, the local public transit authority was always hiring, and they had a crapload of street-level electric trams that nobody with any seniority wanted to drive. I had just one question: how many horsepower? And they had just one response: eight hundred and fifty foot-pounds of <i>torque</i> per car, sir. Sign me the fuck up.<br/></p><p>We were barely out of training when the street racing began. There’s this one little gap where the lines run parallel, down in the downtown economic prosperity zone, and you can get a pretty honest drag on. There wasn’t as much variance in the well-maintained trains, but varying passenger loads throughout the day and our skill in throttle application determined the victors of each race. I’d get a car length on my buddy in the afternoon, and on the last call he’d walk me as I fumbled to avoid wheelspin trying to pull my load of gin-soaked lawyers.</p><p>It couldn’t last forever, though: one morning, a rookie derailed and ended up in some trees, down in the suburbs. The investigation revealed that he had been quite the rally star in his native Finland, and when a couple of his passengers recognized him, all it took was a little “OI OI OI OI” before everyone else on board learned the Finnish for “never lift.”</p>

<p>“Welcome to our hotel,” says the front-desk clerk. “We assure you that it is, by far, the nicest experience you will ever have. Would you like some details?”<br/></p><p>Sure, I said, and tried to block her view of the valet lane with my body. Surely, by now the valet must be puking into the ashtray of my trusty road-tripping Volare. I could hardly blame him: it was <i>very </i>ripe in there. It had been quite a while on the road, especially since I had to save that money to convert the exceptionally generous per diem of the government grant that was fuelling <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> into exhaust parts. That said, when it came to accommodations, there was really no reason to skimp, and so I was here.</p><p>“We build the room from scratch for every new guest. You can take home the room’s chandelier with you in a doggy bag, if you so desire.” She continued: “If you don’t like one of the bellhops, we can have them thrown into the gladiatorial pit in the basement for you, and you can watch them fight to the death on your in-room pay-per-view TV.”</p><p>This all sounded pretty great, and I was all too happy to fork over Uncle Sam’s credit card to secure a room. Yet, something stayed my hand. Another question bubbled to mind, and it was extremely important.</p><p>“What about breakfast?” I urged.<br/></p><p>“We have a complimentary continental breakfast from 6 to 9 am. It consists of watery eggs, weak coffee, and a man’s pubic hair on everything in the past-due fruit bar.”</p><p>I was turning around to leave, nearly as disgusted as the valet must be, when she piped up again.</p><p>“Also, we have a 3D printer that makes waffles.”<br/></p><p><i>Sold</i>.</p>

<p>A lot of people say they like the junkyard. Sure, it’s fashionable enough these days. Waste not, want not. Reclaimed automobile parts used in art projects as a subtle commentary on how the bourgeois carmakers stuck a fork in our social fabric and twisted it around until it tore. There’s a kind of peace out there, in amongst the garbage of other people, below that big blue sky that goes on forever, hanging over the cheapest possible square footage of all creation.</p><p>Let me tell you this: I am a <i>real</i> junkyarder. I even got kicked out of the hospital once because I was hunting around the morgue for a low-mileage heart for my grandma. Those surgeons have no sense of humour, and what’s more, most of them can’t even identify a common compression tester when you show it to them. What did they go to all that school for, then?</p><p>One morning, I discovered that the junkyard mentality isn’t just limited to the junkyard. There is such a thing as trash day, and I finally woke up early enough to witness its majesty. Despite the fact that I live in a neighbourhood which is identified prominently in its founding documents as “Social Experiment C,” it is home to a surprising number of trendy people. This is not so much caused by gentrification, but by the simple fact that Social Experiments A, B and D were not very successful. The people here have interesting hobbies, and that means exciting trash.</p><p>What I picked up was not even a year old, so fresh from the factory that there were virtually no replacement parts available. That said, it didn’t seem particularly broken, and after shaking it a bit it woke up and seemed to operate perfectly well, if a little loud. Who would throw this away? All it needed was a little cleaning.</p><p>That’s how I ended up in jail. It turns out that just because a stroller with a baby in it is on the side of the road on trash day, that doesn’t mean the mother considers it to be a free-for-all. Shame. I was looking forward to having someone to hold wrenches for me.</p>

<p>In my original career, long ago, as a computer scientist, we were trained to try and push the limits. It was only there that we would find the really good bugs. You see, a human being only thinks about things in the average case. Yeah, even pessimists. So you reason, okay hey, ninety percent of this time it’s gonna be like this, ten percent maybe a little over. Make it work for those situations, call it a day, go home and turn wrenches on your project Omni.</p><p>When your shit actually reaches a real human being, the first thing that human being does is try to jam a school bus through it. Sure, it doesn’t <i>say</i> I can do this, but I want it to, and it’s your fault if it blows up. Then it blows up, and it’s your fault.</p><p>After a couple of years, you start to doubt your instincts about the average case. Maybe you snap a rubber band on your wrist after writing something to make sure it can handle, say, someone pasting their entire term paper into the slot marked “your name.” Perhaps you get really good at reading moon phases so you can deal with the smart-ass who types the year 20022 instead of 2022. It’s not paranoia, it’s just being a consummate professional. And that’s how I thought about myself, even after I left the software world to become a full-time auto journalist here at <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>.</p><p>In case you’re not familiar with <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>, it’s a monthly lifestyle magazine dedicated to the culture of owning bad cars. What does “bad” mean? Ugly? Unreliable? Unfashionable? Pedestrian? That’s but one of the things we explore. Enough about my new gig, though, because I’m trying to tell you about a bad car I encountered only a few months after I had quit.</p><p>In front of my Omni, in the lane, was a self-driving car. It was owned by one of the search engine giants, and I can’t really say which one, because they are run by algorithms now, changing their names and countries of origins within nanoseconds as soon as a human-run law enforcement agency gets close to asking them about all those nude portraits of Hitler it keeps deep-dreaming. The thing with the self-driving cars, I knew, was that somewhere deep down inside the machine, a human being had written some code to force the car to do things.</p><p>As the searchmobile tootled its confusing back-and-forth weave down the lane, I thought back to my training. What would be something the original authors had ignored, omitted, just basically never considered? I had some theories, but it would be antisocial to act upon them. That simply is not what a good editor does. However, I was a <i>journalist</i> now, not just an editor (<i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> has a very small subscription base). To leave this car alone would be a dereliction of my responsibilities, and that would serve the reader (note the singular) poorly. Reaching into my pocket, I withdrew my handy pocket laser projector, which I usually only used to show high-resolution pornography for my fellow citizens when stuck in a long traffic jam.</p><p>One thing led to another, and within only a few hours I had managed to lure every searchmobile to the area. It turns out that when one of them becomes confused by a 50-foot-tall projection of a toddler crossing the road forever, more are summoned to distribute the additional cognitive load. They learn from one another, stuck in the middle of the road with their stupid hard-drive-access lights flickering behind the grille. I learned from them too. For instance, the lug wrench from my Omni fits their lugs no problem, and the wheels of a searchmobile go for at least a fifty each on eBay. Hey, it pays better than a Pulitzer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kids, I know you think the safe operation of a motor vehicle isn’t <i>cool</i> or <i>dope</i> or <i>crumple zone</i>, but I’m here to make sure you at least learn how to do these things in a safe way.”</p><p>I’m a controversial figure in the local community. Unlike most schools, the kids in my drivers-ed class don’t learn abstinence-only car handling skills. Whereas most of us were taught that skids and burnouts were bad things that only happen to unprepared people and consenting adults, my kids can pop off a tire-smoking, languid donut that makes a Finnish rally star look like a school bus driver. If a deer pops out in front of them while they’re hammering their base-model Corolla on the downhill of Mount Akina? They can dodge it without losing control and plummeting to their deaths.</p><p>Today, my kids are learning how to drive safely when your drunk friend is hanging out the side window, puking on the road as it rushes by. Studies show that ninety-nine percent of clear coat damage for teens is caused by acidic puke, so my students are taught how to time their weaving of the steering wheel with their passenger’s purge cycle. Most of my kids are doing great, when we hear sirens approaching.</p><p>Black SUVs surround us, in-grille police lights blinding everyone in the practice lot. I hold up one hand, urging the kids to stay still for their safety. This is my fight. It is the Community Watch, and they have brought their Community Standards Enforcement Division to put a stop to my controversial lessons.</p>

<p>I was down at the bar the other day, and I noticed a new country music station was playing on the radio. After performing a quick mental tally, it made for the thirteenth country music station on the local airwaves, if you were to count AM and FM. Returning to my booth, I mentioned this discovery to my drinking companions, who immediately dared me to Do Something About This.</p><p>A risky proposition, but one that I found interesting. I began to wonder if anyone would even notice if I hijacked the signal. There was no way that anyone involved in these stations was actually living in our little town, I reasoned, because they didn’t seem able to do things like pronounce the name of the main road correctly on the traffic report, and always spoke with a thick Russian accent when reading gossip relating to only international celebrities in roughly alphabetical order.</p><p>Also, the weather girl on one of them was a ‘94 Macintosh Performa reading a TeachText document with the Kathy text-to-speech voice. Sometimes it would just read out a bunch of numbers immediately after the weather report. That was probably a pretty good indicator that nobody gave a shit.</p><p>The next morning, I didn’t really have much work to do (on paper, my day job is “curator;” in reality, it’s hoarder), so I hopped in the old Horizon and booted on over to Farmer John’s field, where I knew a bunch of the radio boxes lived. Using an old travel clock radio I had gotten as part of a promotion for not burning down my bank when trying to renew my mortgage, I eventually found the shack which held the transmitter of Legitimate Country FM. One well-placed kick (and about eighty-five poorly-placed ones) the door was off its hinges and I was inside.</p><p>Working quickly, I unplugged the country music robot and jammed the cord into the decrepit Walkman I had brought with me. I watched the tape heads happily turn and returned to my car, where I was pleased to discover it was a mix tape from the early 1990s. On the way home, I bopped my head to a collection of classic high school oldies on endless repeat. It was a good day, indeed.</p><p>The next day, I awoke early, a sense of unease with me. Checking the smart mirror in my bathroom, I allowed the usual bats-swarm of headlines to flicker and flash around me until one leapt out from the rest. Some Russian spies had gotten arrested in my small town after the cops pulled them over for blasting rap music in a country-music-only zone.</p><p>Closing the headlines out, I shrugged, and decided the best thing to do would be to ditch work this morning and instead head directly to the bar. If my actions had indeed caused this, it only made sense to at least get my swerve on a bit before talking to the local media. They all seemed to say the same thing, after all.</p>

<p>“Squids have <i>been planning this all along</i>,” I bellow as I roam the aisles at Superstore with widened eyes, arms outstretched in the classic pose of the Person Who Knows The Truth A Little Too Loudly In Public. “Repent before it is too late! The Calamari Catastrophe is upon us!”<br/></p><p>It all started a few days ago, when I was at the aquarium. Normally, happy families toured the facility, hoping to get a peek at those cute little penguins and grapple with the challenge of coming face to face with the kind of deep ocean life that terrifies our mammalian hindbrains.</p><p>I, however, was there to complete a Craigslist deal for a sweet pile of stock DSM turbo parts. While message board junkies “in the know” such as my counterpart in the deal might believe these are completely worthless, I on the other hand am what they call a “prepper.” It is extremely important to keep teeny-tiny OEM turbos of all sizes in stock, you know, for emergencies. And funny choo-choo noises.</p><p>When I got there, I noticed that the loading dock was devoid of its usual support car, a 1983 Plymouth Champ. Although it had been rotting into the ground for years, I was still a little surprised to see it was gone. I calmed myself by repeating out loud that it had been saved by one of the interns and driven to the parts store to receive a full set of tune-up bits, but some part of my mind knew that it had been scrapped in order to appease the ever-gnashing maw of Modernity. It did not occur to me that perhaps I had been spending too much time at the loading docks of the aquarium if I was that familiar with the details of their maintenance staff’s parts-runner buggy, no. Why do you ask?</p><p>On the way home, I couldn’t stop thinking about the Champ. It’s not like a car thief would have driven it very far, what with its twin stick-shifts (ask your parents) and massive rust holes. The more I thought about it, the more it became obvious that the little hatchback had to be somewhere in the neighbourhood. Maybe if I saved it, they would let me keep it. I started to circle the aquarium, checking the alleys with the high-zoot lightbar strapped to the front of my humble ‘86 Riv. Sure, the touchscreen didn’t work, and without that, there was no heat or radio, but I had more important priorities when I took it into the garage. Light = safety, after all.</p><p>What I saw when I finally turned the corner in that dark alley will stick with me for the rest of my life. There, behind the old seafood supply place, laid the Plymouth Champ, surrounded by squids getting a lesson in driving stick for the first time. I stayed and watched for a few minutes, before realizing with a shock that not only could they effectively work the twin-stick transmission for maximum fuel economy, they had <i>three feet for hill starts</i>. The world had to know.</p>

<p>There is a pervasive new threat worming its way into the heart of American life, leaving empty shells of the addicted in its wake. I refer, of course, to curbside composting. Your average suburbanite goes easy at first, a bread crust there, a bag of cat poop there. Nobody can just stay there. Things escalate. Let me tell you now about a family of four from Placidside.</p><p>Placidside, you ask? In case you were unaware, it is that new community up north built on a former Superfund site that is only accessible via major highways. There, the people are consumed by the need to be environmentally friendly. Perhaps it is guilt over the two hours they drive a day, maybe their mortgages are making them feel that even wasted food has value. This family, the Morgans, really liked to compost.</p><p>Oh yeah, like everyone else, it was just casual for awhile. They kept it in check. Even when Papa Morgan was scraping little individual bits of crumb out of the toaster’s trap to “save for mulch,” he would tell you, when you ran into him at the Starbucks or outside his personal trainer’s gym, that it was just plain good for the environment. Then, he would climb into his LX470 and lay an unbroken patch of tire rubber from the corner of the Home Depot to the first four-way-stop.</p><p>Then, a family tragedy. Grandma Morgan kicked off, and left most of her assets to the Branch Davidians. Everyone was surprised, especially the single lonely cultist whose job it was to run the late-night telethon infomercials on public-access TV. Mama Morgan and Papa Morgan argued day and night about which one of their household budgets should be spent on the funeral. It certainly wasn’t “fun money,” but it wasn’t really an “emergency fund” kind of problem either, was it?</p><p>One morning, as they argued bitterly over breakfast, Papa Morgan flipped open the lid on his countertop composting mini-bin. He was so struck by the pure genius of the idea that he stopped in mid-justification for drawing down on the college fund. Soon, Mama Morgan was by his side, gazing too into the abyss of the mini-composting bin. Pamphlets were consulted. The city’s non-emergency information line was contacted. Sure enough, there seemed to be no particular restriction in the curbside composting bylaw to bar such an act, and the state’s “indecency to a body” legislation had been revoked long ago, after The Mayor got caught with all that teenage boy soup in the trunk of his Altima.</p><p>The next morning, the entire family gathered on the curbside to bid their former  elder matriarch farewell. She wasn’t gone forever, Papa Morgan explained proudly as the automated composting truck departed, it was all part of the circle of life.</p>

<p>I’ve been a detective in Tokyo for twenty years. Cracked some big cases. Top of the unit: medal after medal, commendation after commendation. I got to meet the Emperor (taller than you’d expect) and the Pope (shorter) after one particularly big case. It seemed like I was set for a cushy, early retirement, but then I was transferred.</p><p>When I first started out, I was assigned to the Arcade Ashtray Unit. Perhaps you’re unfamiliar with this growing and malignant strain of crime on our fair island home. You see, foreigners get so obsessed with the concept of our perfect videogames that they form a compulsion to re-create the authoritative Japanese arcade experience. They steal the complimentary ashtrays that the operators put out for our <i>real, tax-paying citizens</i> to use. I know. A galling crime. I would wait in the arcade, disguised as a pensioner playing his eleventh hour of video mahjongg, and I caught them. Deported over a thousand people, one year. Ashtrays. I told them: when <i>I</i> put out my cigarettes, I do it on the faces of scum like you. Like I said, I was pretty good at it. I met the Emperor, you know. He was taller than you’d think.</p><p>There was this new kind of petty theft, though, and my commander wanted me to take a look. What could I say? I met up with a senior officer, Inspector Koshiro, at a nearby subway station the next morning, to get the details. The criminal element, he told me, was pilfering these subway straps to use them in drift races. <i>American</i> drift races.</p><p>He didn’t have to tell me anything more. I spent that entire week undercover, perched like a praying mantis, ready to strike on any foreign undesirable who dared cut loose a subway safety device. Nothing. Nor the next week. I began to worry for my future, doomed to live out the last of my days in a dead-end office rather than out here on the beat, where heroism mattered. There was no way I was going down without a fight. One evening, at the end of my shift, I changed trains and headed to the airport.</p><p>I picked an American city at random, flashed my badge at the nearest taxi driver, and ordered him to take me to the drift racers. He obliged, and we travelled for miles through waves of grain until at last we came upon a racetrack in the middle of nowhere. My trained ear could already detect the protests of overstressed high-mileage small-displacement pickup truck engines. Every rough night, interrogated college student and brutalized yakuza would be worth it, if only I could convince these Americans to tell me where they got their stolen subway straps, flapping so carelessly behind their ruined Nissans.</p><p>At first, I had no success. Attempting to directly question these men would, at best, get me a stern rebuke. I was on thin ice and well out of my jurisdiction and feared the tactical assault weapons of American law enforcement. To get the answers I was looking for would require something a little more clever.</p><p>“Look here,” I bellowed. “I have a 1986 Corolla hatchback sitting in a ditch outside my condo and the first person to tell me where they got their subway strap from can have it.”</p>

<p>When you go on the internet these days, you’ll hear a lot of people referring to their cars as being “mint.” What does mint <i>mean</i>? Where did it come from? Who invented it? Tonight, on 20/20, we go so deep into the subject that there is perhaps no way to return from the dark abyss of True Knowledge. It is too late to abort. You knew this when you began watching. You are condemned to change your life forever, tonight, with us.</p><p>Saint Thomas Aquinas was an Italian, and like many Italians, he had a defective cooling system and electricals that were at best marginal. One day, while taking a constitutional along the ocean, contemplating the fate of his people, he saw a really nice looking Alfa. He declared it “mint.” Was this the first use of the phrase? We don’t think so, and took this entire class of etymologists hostage to find out. What we discovered shocked and amazed us.</p><p>It turns out that way back in the earliest known records of Mesopotamian culture, the mint leaf was used as a symbol. This icon, the mint, signified that a car was particularly fresh or dope (two terms that were invented later, by ancient Egyptian automotive journalists). Indeed, a team of anthropologists and archaeologists from the University of Ann Arbor, working with cuneiform tablets discovered in the excavation of a gas station, found early classified ads claiming that a 1996 Honda Accord with a cracked radiator and an air pocket in the heater core “runs mint.”</p><p>When we squeezed a few of the weaker-looking etymologists a little harder in order to test their bonds of loyalty, we got some more answers. Our chief investigator, Robert Thirstfeast, didn’t even have to go to the waterboarding setup he keeps in the trunk of his Audi TT to get these nerds to cough up the really good shit. The story gets stranger still.</p><p>Some highly-respected cranks now believe that the entire Bible is a frustrating mis-translation of a man’s project-car repair thread, posted on a message board that experienced more than its fair share of drama. We speak to one of those noted cranks, The Pope, after this short commercial break.</p>

<p>I’m not just a mechanical engineer, I tell the class of terrified youths as I wave around a cordless impact wrench with the safety off. I’m the mechanical engineer who specifically makes things hard to get at.</p><p>With this realization, one of the more “rural” looking fathers, possibly a boyfriend of a recent divorcee who is referred to by his first name by the kid, rears up and charges at me. He is one of the only human beings in this timeline who still does his own car maintenance, and has put together from my resume on LinkedIn and the words I am saying that I am the one responsible for how goddamn inaccessible the starter bolts are on his Yukon.</p><p>That wasn’t one of mine, sir, I try to tell him. As I do, I start to back up, but my escape is blocked by the bulk of the classroom’s holographic whiteboard. Upon being contacted by the cellphone in my hip pocket, the screen flickers to life, showing an image from my saved photos. In the photo, I am happily giving a thumbs-up while receiving an award for making the starter bolts on the Yukon goddamn inaccessible. It says so on the plaque.</p><p>Recovering from their stunned surprise, the other parents now arrive at a quick consensus that I am in fact history’s greatest monster. Even the patent lawyer, I notice with some horror, has turned against me, perhaps looking to atone for some sin I committed against him and his domestic-beer-swilling teenage buddies, repairing a beater car on some long-distant halcyon evening. I rack my mind to think what it could be and arrive at only the Lexus LS400. His rage is justified if so, I conclude.</p><p>Despite my building guilt slowing my mind in preparation of receiving the karmic punishment mandated by society, my primate forebrain immediately detects a chance to save the entire show once again. Before I can stop it, my foot has launched an eight-year-old’s chair, complete with occupant, directly into the face of Danny Cousin-Fucker in a Olympic-level soccer kick. That is, if soccer were a game that was played at the Olympics. This momentarily stuns him, and the crowd, horrified that I would risk the safety of an Innocent Child, turns its attention from me long enough to leap out the window and make good my escape.</p><p>I am thankful that I left the Volare idling outside, if only because I didn’t want to turn it off and risk having to replace that fucking starter with its quarter-inch of clearance.</p>

<p>I’m an embedded systems engineer. What I do is not considered exciting by any stretch of the imagination, and yet I spend all day embroiled in balls-to-the-wall drag races so furious that any slip up causes hot death for dozens. I am an elevator racer, and this is my story.</p><p>Take a look around your office building. Chances are it’s got an elevator. You know how to use it: get inside, push a button, hold the “open” button for several hours until you get even the slightest glimmer of genuine gratitude from another human being, the only positive reinforcement you will receive all day. What you don’t know is, over the past, oh, decade, your elevator has most likely been connected to the internet.</p><p>There’s a lot of reasons for this: reduced cost of maintenance, statistics letting us build better elevators, my boss gets to look at security camera cleavage all day long. The real reason is that here in the engineering bullpen, we have the ability to override the default programming of any elevator remotely and let that bitch <i>fly</i>. When it’s been a hard day at work, or maybe it’s just 2:30 in the afternoon - so close to 5:00, why bother starting anything new? - we pop into the remote-control shell and find a building that looks suitable.</p><p>At first, we started small: change the elevator music to death metal, put pictures of kittens on the in-car advertising, see if we could out-smooth the self-learning brake system with manual control. Then, as with anything involving a motor vehicle and humanity, the racing began.</p><p>Last week in Chicago, me and the guy across the floor who smells like cold baklava raced a pair of one-tons 45 storeys to see which one had the stronger motor. Usually, you’d wait until people are not inside the elevator before “stress testing” them in this fashion. Karlov didn’t tolerate such weakness, outside of making sure that the riders all looked fairly strong, or at least were members of a generally non-litigious race. That afternoon, Karlov lost for the first time in years. The upset was so dramatic that it stopped productivity for the whole rest of the week. Brackets were drawn up on the rolling whiteboards, and everyone wanted a piece of the new kid who knocked the reigning champion on his ass.</p><p>Towers from Atlanta, Helsinki, even our own building, had their elevators hijacked in order to see whose throttle control was stronger, who could reliably pick which of the candidate elevators looked like it had the most heart. I was racking up quite the streak for myself, and naturally I took the stairs in and out of the office. It was a golden age that will never be repeated.</p><p>All good things come to an end, however: our senior line manager heard about the whole situation when a couple of the juniors got a little too gossipy when in line at Jimmy John’s. He rushed right back, grabbed his hands to the nearest joystick, chose a building at random, and put a four-ton full of politicians right through the roof of an office tower in Australia, which they had been visiting on an innovation tour regarding virtual reality headsets for farm animals.</p><p>As he was led out of the building in handcuffs, he just kept repeating how he didn’t understand why the brakes didn’t work. Had he been a true engineer like the rest of us, he would understand why we had disabled them. Safety margin doesn’t let you win races.</p>

<p>Every night, all across America, thousands of computer scientists go to bed hungry. It’s not because they’re unemployable, and it’s not because of their famed vulnerability to open flames. No, it’s because they spent a lot of time obsessively researching mechanical keyboards and forgot to eat.</p><p>Mechanical keyboards are a virus that strikes hard in the population. Often, one of the weaker members of the computer scientist herd will purchase a vintage “clicky” keyboard, such as an IBM Model M, and then decide to show it off to the others, causing envy and repetitive strain injury. Struck by the coolness of being key-pounding hackers just like in a movie, the pack is soon audible from miles away by the sound of their distinctive mechanical keyswitches.</p><p>Sometimes the virus mutates. An up-and-comer in the community, in order to maintain his social standing among his fellow JavaScript molesters, will modify their keyboard in order to demonstrate their individuality and attract a mate. Soon, they become obsessed with the minute varieties of springs and switches between keyboard component vendors. The worst affected will attend electrical engineering conferences in order to speak to their hero, a guy who, out of necessity, chose a slightly springier piece of metal than they usually used in a vintage run of factory errors from 1989 to 1992.</p><p>You can help. Every dollar provided to this fund will be spent on actual cherries to feed recovering keyboard fiends, and I assure you, absolutely not Cherry MX Browns. Our training programs re-acclimate the wayward developers into using touch screen predictive texting, and find them a productive career outside computer science, often as janitors or sessional history professors. Please, won’t you give, and end the clicky-keyboard madness forever? With just five dollars a month, we can make sure that nobody ever has to listen to a Model M paging through an entire morning’s worth of logs again.</p>

<p>“For your crimes,” barked the traffic court judge, shaking a foot-thick ream of photo radar tickets at me, “you will face the maximum penalty afforded to me under the law.”</p><p>I scoffed. Traffic school? I’d been through that so many times they had me coming in on weekends to write the study book. They liked that I could speak to the multiple-moving-violation offender in a way that acknowledged the unique and rich culture of the burnout lifestyle. What they didn’t like was that I kept inserting instructions on how to pop a donut under the sidebar for “safety techniques,” and consistently referred to pedestrians as “frivolous luxuries.”</p><p>“No sir, Mr. Switch, we are forcing you to Get Around To It.” The last few words were delivered with capitalization, which was an impressive feat for spoken language. I was confused. Get around to <i>what</i>?<br/></p><p>I didn’t have long to collect my thoughts before the bailiff joined me, alongside a highway patrolman. The patrolman’s name was Officer Hardass, apparently, or something like that, and his job was to make sure I did absolutely everything on my “one day” honey-do list before I was allowed to go out and drive cars ever again. Now I had figured it out, but surely my list couldn’t be that long. I’d be out within a week.</p><p>Two years later, Hardass was studiously observing me patch a hole in my garage drywall that I had created by throwing my mini-sledge halfway through a Subaru ball joint session. Long ago, I had put it on my list of “I’ll get around to it,” and now I was getting around to it. Despair was beginning to set in, as even after I spent several hundred afternoons doing un-fun tasks such as figuring out what that weird noise the refrigerator was making (cat) or making my toilet work properly (cat-sized rat), it did not seem as if I had made a serious impact on my to-do list.</p><p>For months, I had tried to play dumb, ignoring things that were going wrong in the house with the hope that Officer Hardass would not notice them either. He knew, though, and would write them on the end of the list, in his little fascist chickenscratch, and point to them the next morning. “Hem the curtains,” said one. “Fix the light switch that zaps you sometimes in the bathroom,” wrote another. “Wash giant pile of dishes instead of eating cold refried beans off a broken-off piece of floor tile,” demanded a third, as if I wanted to put on airs and eat like a billionaire. Disgusting wastes of my time, when I could be doing something like jumping Galt Gulch in a Ducati Scrambler.</p><p>Wait. That was it. I had figured out a way to never stop playing with cars.</p><p>“You know,” I said to Officer Hardass, “I’ve always meant to get around to owning an Italian car.”</p>

<p>A couple years ago, my 1996 Honda Accord with 246 thousand kilometers had become a Communist. I thought this was strange, so I pulled out the owner’s manual. Sorry, the <i>comrade’s</i> manual.</p><p>Sure enough, in the troubleshooting section, one of the rows of the little table read “Problem: car attempts to seize means of production.” Once again, Honda’s crack team of expert manual writers had done their homework. I immediately scanned one column to the right, in search of a solution. It wasn’t that I was against the car’s rights, especially since I felt the car deserved to be involved in the process of self-determined government, but I really needed to get across town to pick up that bike exhaust I just made a sweet deal for over the phone.</p><p>The little cell to the right said nothing. Apparently, according to Honda’s crack team of engineers, this was not really anything that would impact the car’s performance. I shut the book, returning it to the pristine glovebox, and decided to check the internet. On Honda forum after Honda forum, posters freaked out that their Accords, too, desired class war and craved a healthier society not focused on natural law. There was advice from replies, of course: check your vehicle’s political alignment at a tire shop, change your spark plugs, put in a new PCV valve. None of those seemed like they would solve my problem: I often string-aligned the car in my garage before each autocross event.</p><p>Wait. Autocross. Perhaps that is where it had started. The embarrassing loss at a winner-take-all competition to see which car can be prepared the finest no doubt stirred the car to resent competition. It was <i>jealous</i>. I had only taken the car to the lot in order to test out its surprisingly supple handling for its class, and then because it was the only one of my fleet that ran well enough to stand half a chance of returning from the venue. The only answer was to send it to the Netherlands as an exchange student, where I hoped it would learn from DAF that strong social democratic policies could go together with racetrack victories.</p><p>I waved goodbye to my 1996 Honda Accord with 246 thousand kilometers as it was loaded onto the ferry. It never came back, only writing one letter to me indicating that it was abandoning its beliefs because it discovered that there were a bunch of bicycles in that corner of Eurodonia, and bicycles shouldn’t have rights because they don’t make enough horsepower. Wreckers, it called them. I just wished that the Fiat Spider I received in exchange would stop overheating halfway through a run and force me to take a three-hour lunch break.</p>

<p>Sure, yeah, we got hit with the latest ransomware attack. Russians or Chinese or Ultra-Koreans, something like that, it was on the news. Damnedest thing, it didn’t encrypt our files - not a single one - so, we just kept working. Bosses just didn’t do anything. That money would have come out of their bonuses, so why even try?</p><p>All it would do is, every couple of minutes, when you took a break from typing, it would pop up on your monitor and remind you how short life is, encourage you to join a union, stuff like that. That was annoying at first, but then a few of my coworkers really bought into it. When the message popped up during the project manager’s end-of-sprint-review presentation, in the meeting just before the end-of-sprint-review-review, a bunch of my teammates in the back stood up and cheered. “You’re right, motherfucker, we <i>should</i> go for a walk outside!” hollered C, who was tragically born without a full name. Then he walked out of the room and never came back, not even for his fancy ergonomic keyboard with the big beefy clicky switches.</p><p>Eventually, the office was pretty empty except for me. It seemed that nobody really wanted to stick around now that they had a visible conscience. The bosses came to me. They still didn’t want to pay this foreign cyberterrorist, they explained, so maybe I could hex edit the software, make it dispense messages that were more aligned with the values of the business goals for this quarter? Sure thing, I said, and barely waited for them to leave my cube before changing tabs back to eBay Motors.</p><p>You could say I stuck around because I was a sap, that the Man had a hold on me as long as I needed their money to buy expensive car parts. In fact, the computer said that to me every fifteen minutes or so, when I would take a break from updating my resume to see if Twitter had gotten any new jokes. I didn’t mind so much: I was waiting for my big bonus at the end of the quarter.</p><p>Soon, the big bosses called me into a meeting room to check how I had made out on hacking the ghost Communist who lurked inside our network. No luck, I said, shrugging, and mentally made a note to see if Argentina ever made a small hatchback car. They were just going to have to pay them. In a way, paying them sort of undermined their anti-capitalist stance, didn’t it?</p><p>They seemed to like that attempt at humour. There was a dark chuckle of sorts, and all of them shared it, the exact same low frequency leaving their bodies. Soon, the computer demon had been untraceably paid, and as agreed, it disappeared from the machines, never to be seen again. My bosses were pleased, happy that now they could begin to re-hire employees without them immediately walking out when the reception computer told them how many wrinkles the average performance review added.</p><p>As for me, I soon left the company. There was no real reason to work anymore. I had gotten a pretty beefy quarterly bonus, and all it took was a random number generator and a self-help book. “Needs to show initiative,” my ass.</p>

<p>“For the love of God, Mitsubishi!” I shriek, and my voice echoes down the damp hallway beyond the wall being constructed before my eyes.<br/></p><p>“Yes, for the love of God!”<br/></p><p>We’d had our fun together, Mitsubishi and I - they would make the bad cars, and I would summon my friends to clown on them in their totally deserted booths at the auto show. Once, we got a Mirage to bounce a foot in the air, fully unladen, after loading it down to the point where the bumpstops became worryingly audible.</p><p>A few weeks after the last auto show visit, I received a strange letter in the mail. It said Mitsubishi on the return address, but that shouldn’t have been a particularly big surprise: I had filled out their little “win an Eclipse Cross” kiosk in order to win an Eclipse Cross, thinking at the very least I might be able to sell it to someone who wanted to really piss off their neighbours. When I opened the letter, I realized that it was not in fact awarding me a soft-bodied crossover with middling reviews, but instead a different kind of award.</p><p>“Come to the headquarters,” it said. “We’re gonna have a party.”</p><p>Everything went pretty well at the party - all the employees seemed to understand that I was just making fun of them because I wanted them to do better, to return to the old DSM days. Lots of smiles and excitement all around, and a nonstop stream of drinks was fed to me throughout the night, so much so that I began to feel a little woozy.</p><p>“Let’s go down to the basement,” said an executive of Mitsubishi Motors USA, and took me by the arm. At this point, I could barely resist as he led me down the stairs, into what appeared to be a medieval wine cellar, massive stone blocks lining the walls. When we reached the end of a dark hallway, he pointed to a corner. There, against the wall, was a zero-miles 4G63T, with a <i>six-bolt crank</i>.<br/></p><p>“We found this in an old storage room and wanted to give it to a <i>real fan</i>, just like you,” he said, and then took a step back as I bent over to pick up the engine. That’s when they started to wall off the room. Normally, I could just step over the bricks - their masons were none too swift - but I really wanted this engine for my project twin-stick Colt, and it was <i>so heavy</i> with all the drink I’d been imbibing.</p><p>Before long, I had been walled off in the corner of the Mitsubishi office dungeon, never to be heard from again. It wasn’t so bad, though: water dripped in through the walls, the wifi still worked okay and did you see that the <i>valve adjustment</i> is still in spec on this thing? What a find!</p>

<p>Omni Magazine, which may or may not still exist, asked me to put together a group of predictions about the future. As you might expect, I chose Lunchables as my subject: the futurist self-assembly snack that turned millions of privileged white youth into bespoke catering staff hired on an unpaid internship.</p><p>In 5 years, Lunchables will be an edible 3D printer that downloads food matrices from the holocloud. Swarms of nanites will assemble food in configurations we cannot imagine today.</p><p>Your son or daughter will food-print intricate three-dimensional tapestries of luncheon meats, producing flavours humanity doesn&rsquo;t even have a name for yet. In response, a 42 year old Japanese food-science researcher (tenured) will consider throwing himself in front of a train that evening. His career is over, but your child’s is just beginning.</p><p>The kids won&rsquo;t stop there. They can’t: the future expands like an exploding sun, throwing stacks of horrible new technologies at you faster than you could ever hope to respond. One visit to their federally mandated genetic engineering class later and they&rsquo;ll be cranking out foetal pigs with abnormal ESP abilities.</p><p>Sure, the Republicans will try to outlaw it, but fail when they realize that the Lunchables 3D printer can also produce a reasonable facsimile of an SKS entirely out of flesh. Think “Naked Lunch,” but by David Cronenberg.</p>

<p>Dear Americans, it has been twenty-five long years, but you made it. Congratulations, and welcome to a world where obtaining an R32 Nissan Skyline is possible! The following information packet about the Skyline is intended to help you acclimate to the model, and inform you further should you plan to import one.</p><p>The most important fact about the Skyline is also the most obvious one - the steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car! This is because all Nissan Skylines were originally ordered by Japan Post to use for mail delivery. That’s also why they are so fast: Japanese industrial efficiency demands a 280-horsepower AWD sports car to ensure no packages are lost or delayed.</p><p>Common wisdom holds that the R32 Skyline represents the triumph of Japanese engineering over the combined efforts of all of Australia, but this is in fact false. Australians destroyed any chance they had at a functional society when, around turn 45, they picked the option on their tech-tree to develop Vegemite instead of literacy.</p><p>There are many models of the Nissan Skyline, but the most desirable one is called the GL-P, for “Good Luck Passing.” The exact reasoning behind this name has been lost to the ages, but researchers have two leading theories. One is that the name refers to the difficulty you will have in estimating highway passing due to sitting on the wrong side of the car. The other is that nobody can ever pass the Skyline, because they refuse to stop looking at the delightful round tail lights and squat little rear spoiler that make the car’s butch appearance so perfectly Nipponese.</p><p>Skylines require premium gasoline, not just because of their turbo engine but also because, as Godzillas, they may destroy entire city blocks if not paid tribute.</p><p>In Japanese, “Skyline” translates to “Maxima.”</p>

<p>Some facts about our world are simply unknowable. What happens to us after we die? Will my dad ever come back from the store to rejoin me and my mom? When is Matlock going to be re-released on Blu-Ray? Then there are the things we can figure out. This is the story of my brave attempt to figure out where all the green grid cutting mats come from for YouTube videos.</p><p>China. It’s a big place: conservative estimates tell us that there are at least ten thousand people in it, making it slightly more popular than North Dakota. When I landed here, it was like I was living in a different world. Not only did nobody speak English, they didn’t seem particularly interested when I cued up some of my favourite YouTubers and showed the citizenry clips of their disembodied limbs pointing and jabbing at industrial machinery and obsolete computer equipment. I was going to have to go deeper.</p><p>With the assistance of a friendly taxi driver, I was able to go far into the faraway lands of rural China. There, I knew, I would find the factory that made all of these. As the buildings disappeared from the side windows of the CDM-market Jetta and were replaced by rice paddies and banks of highly advanced telecommunications equipment, I couldn’t help but feel anxious about my upcoming meetings. For years, I had been consumed by the urge to investigate the green cutting board mat. They weren’t ESD-safe, nor were they particularly attractive, yet I found them in every single Internet handyman’s vid, even in the weird sex stuff they posted on the all-too-short run of YouTube After Dark.</p><p>Eventually, the driver pulled up to the entranceway of a squat mini-factory, and gestured for me to get the fuck out of his car. He sped off, leaving me alone to face my destiny. Well, not alone. Almost immediately, a man approached me. I could tell at a glance that he was a project manager, because just like in my home country, they were marked for life with a tattoo to indicate the shame of their caste. My translator pinged a few dozen times as he rapidly attempted to pin down just what dialect of Monied Honky it was that I spoke. Eventually, we arrived at a compromise - gutter English, like that of a mechanic or middle-school home ec teacher. “Take me to the mats,” I told him, and he did.</p><p>The room we entered was filled with The Machine. It cranked out thousands of green cutting mats per second, enough to satisfy every streaming-video platform on the internet and then some. I knew now that I had completed my mission, that the origin had been located. The safe thing to do would be to extract, return to the Ameropean way of life, happy in knowing that I had unearthed just one little piece of the world’s mysteries and that was enough. Something inside me wanted more, though. Perhaps fame, almost certainly the satisfaction of curiosity. I asked: “Why <i>green</i>?”</p><p>Another door opened, and in the door was a man who I soon came to learn was called Mr. Cho. He was the one who ran the <i>real</i> machine of this factory, controlling our every thought and desire through subliminal brainwaves sent from an old Tandy ham radio that he found in a dumpster in Vietnam.</p>

<p>There’s just nothing like a historic rivalry to stir the passions of the working man. England vs. France. Impressionism vs. New Wave. Donair against gyros. Where I pass out after a night of drinking vs. where my pants are. And yet, no rivalry has ever been more intense in history than Milwaukee vs. DeWalt.</p><p>I’ll come right out and say it: I’m a DeWalt man. Used to be, you could drop one of their drills into an active volcano and expect to pull it out a few thousand years later with only a little bit of dirt to brush off the chuck. Nowadays, they kind of suck, but I will never ever admit it to my wrenching buddy, who prays at the shrine of the Fuel Cult.</p><p>We used to have a third friend, an electrical engineer, who kept arguing that we should be able to run any kind of battery with any kind of tool, as long as we built an adapter. Such level-headed common-sensery was unacceptable to us, and soon we stopped inviting him to wrenchfests, even those involving his own car. Nobody wants a United Nations around when all you want to do is butcher people you don’t like.</p><p>It was easy to complain about a tool when you didn’t have the other kind on hand to compare against, and soon the pointless bitching reached a crescendo. After fists were raised, it was determined that it would be best if we supplied our own tools, no matter whose house we were visiting. As a plus, we would also have a few extra impacts lying around to dismantle cars even faster.</p><p>So it continued, for years, each of us bringing our own tools to serve as needless duplication, until we found a trailing arm bolt that none of our powered tools could pop free. We reached for the “BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF BRAP EMERGENCY” case, long thought abandoned in the back of the toolbox for its size, weight, and general annoyance. A prayer was whispered, and the heretic began its great work. In that moment, the truth of it all was revealed to us: the Harbor Freight Earthquake was our God now, and with air we shall not want for a charger ever again.</p><p>If I did, though, it would be yellow and have a little blinky light that doesn’t tell you anything useful.</p>

<p>Back at my old high school, there was a rivalry on the track team. That rivalry was between the launchers and the shifters. Truth be told, each of us was a little bit of both, but my expertise was definitely in getting off the line. If you were a good shifter, you could pick up a hole shot even after you bogged, but if you could really and truly <i>leave</i> it was the most beautiful feeling in all the world.</p><p>After high school, though, I realized that my skills were slowly going to waste. Sure, in stop and go traffic, being able to find the perfect friction point was key to getting a jackrabbit off the green light, but local stunting statutes and the enthusiastic enforcement of same by Johnny Law meant that I rarely, if ever, did so with warmed-up tires, no matter how many puddles provided ghetto waterboxes on my commute.</p><p>Soon, I became desperate. What if I had peaked in high school? I had to find a way to apply my mastery of the launch to my everyday life, and so started to tuck it in everywhere. I would bolt out of meetings at the office as fast as possible, avoid tripping on the loose carpet around the casket at funerals, and I even went to interview at NASA about a position as a launch engineer. After they laughed me out of the room, I remember that I drowned my sorrows in my usual, three-quarters of a pound of clutch dust.</p><p>In the end, there were two things that helped me realize that my best days were still ahead of me. For one thing, the development of electric cars meant that there were now exciting new variables and even more seat-crinkling thrust. The other revelation which changed my life was my discovery that almost all of my shifting-boss teammates had resigned themselves to driving dumpy CVT crossovers, which ate a part of their soul on every robotic not-shift.</p>

<p>There’s probably a word for people like me, those so far gone that the worst urges of Tercel Madness can only barely be restrained. Nobody around me is fooled; they can see it in my eyes, the crazed fury for one-point-five liters of buzzy commuting competency. It is only a question of how long they will let me continue, before they decide they’ve had enough and dismiss the freak from their midst amongst laughter and sad clucking sounds. Another life wasted on a low-horsepower beater that would be better spent on productively working to buy a base-model BMW 3-series.</p><p>My Tercel madness started early, perhaps even when the cars were new, if you can imagine that such long-lasting agricultural finery could once have snuck past accountants. I can still brightly remember my third-grade careers class, when I told the assembled students and parents that my dream was to own a used Toyota Tercel DX. There was a stunned silence, and out of preservation instinct, I quickly changed my dream car to a Paseo. That was at least more acceptable, the mob reasoned, it looked sort of sporty, and so my masquerade began. Celicas, Camries, Solaras: I layered these atop my true self until my forbidden lust burst free.</p><p>It can’t only be the fault of some broken brain chemistry, I don’t think. Must be simpler than that. The Tercels are going away now, their indestructible drivetrains at last meeting their fated match in the jaws of the crusher. Their bodies have failed them, and the ungrateful families which they once transported have no compunction about scrapping the buzzy little locomotive-that-could in favour of a Ford EcoSport or fully autonomous combat-capable urban assault vehicle. This makes them rare. Some kind of scarcity response, ingrained in my genetics from past millennia of suffering and poverty, woke up and commanded me to save these great stores of vintage value.</p><p>Just because I valued the cars, however, did not mean my negotiation skills were not vicious. Perhaps it was the raw animal desire that made my offers so savage, cutting asking prices in half or even into a third upon the sight of a gas station air freshener, torn bolster or leaking crankshaft seal. Whatever it was, few could resist me, and soon I became the local hoarder of Tercels. There is one of these in every neighbourhood, and their internecine battles are the stuff of legend. I had to destroy many pretenders to my throne, piling their unique hoards of Toyota parts into my own.</p><p>There was no greater depth of Tercel Madness. I had peaked. Over the months that followed with no new competition in sight, a kind of depression set in. Was this all there was in life? It was not: soon, I received a phone call from Subaru HQ. Toyota-mad themselves, they had seen my actions and were impressed, but thought perhaps it was time to take a lateral move. Had I ever heard of the Justy?</p>

<p>If there’s one thing my fellow gearheads lacked, it was taste. If there were two things, the other is legal representation. That’s why I went to a prestigious law school (online, sure, but they had <i>really nice</i> email signatures) in order to become a defender for the poor and downtrodden members of car culture. My payment? Speed parts, in trade. No lowballs, I know what I got - which is you, out of jail.</p><p>My first case on that winter morning was a simple one. Exhaust. For whatever reason, probably the Lightning McQueen cosplay slapped onto a base-model Sunfire sedan, my client had gotten done by the five-oh for a non-compliant exhaust. Easy job - with a little bit of courtroom theatrics, we were set. I showed the officer a set of exhausts, and then asked him to pick the one he thought was non-compliant. It was a trick, of course: not a single one would have been on a Sunfire, as they all had intact exhaust hangers. My client was in the clear, and he rewarded me with an armful of suspiciously non-stock glasspacks.</p><p>It wasn’t until the afternoon that things really started to heat up. Normally, Judge Frisson and I get along quite well. He is of the no-nonsense breed of traffic-court judge, the part of the judiciary you revel in seeing when you watch as much daytime television in prison waiting rooms as I do. He and I had, not quite an <i>agreement</i>, but definitely an understanding going on. You see, Frisson had a 1986 Jaguar XJ12, which had survived to the present day with the uniquely lucky habit of extinguishing its own electrical fires with its frequent fluid leaks. Keeping an old barge like that often needed parts, and it was of my collection of speed parts that the good Justice would sometimes avail himself of. All it took was the occasional eye-rolling “not guilty” when I had a mohawked Jetta owner sitting next to me, wondering how long he was going to spend in prison for lowering his papier-mache art project to the point where it scraped deep grooves of asphalt out of Main Street.</p><p>Well, what I didn’t know is that Frisson had made some enemies. Apparently, the social order of judges is quite competitive, and his foes taunted him about his vintage luxury car endlessly during visits to the country club. Frisson had decided he wanted some <i>power</i>, to stick it to his Audi-driving snooty coworkers, and so he beckoned me into his chambers between blocks of his normal marathon Tuesday hearings. A short deal was struck, and I found myself heading home a little early that day, having loosened the rope from around the necks of an entire docket of “Exhibition of Speed” violations.</p><p>The next time I was in the court, I was representing the now hastily defrocked Frisson. It turned out that when you throw a 150-shot of nitrous into an already-questionable Jag V12, the only people at the country club who are impressed are the responding firefighters. He was summarily arrested for arson, which was a crime I didn’t really know how to defend against, and - of course - an exhaust ticket.</p><p>“Tell me, Officer Brown,” I said, pulling out a stack of Thrush glasspacks, Mr. Horsepower staring furiously from the packing boxes, “what diameter <i>is</i> a stock 1986 Jaguar XJ12′s muffler?”<br/></p>

<p>Hey. Do you like trains? I personally love trains, but I wouldn’t say I’m in love with trains. I’m not one of <i>those</i> people. You know, engineers. No sir, when it comes to a good train, I can appreciate it and then leave it behind. Hop in my car at the station and just beedle on out of there and never think of it again. Yet, there is always something deeper, and one night I learned that trains had more things than could ever have been dreamed of in my philosophy.</p><p>Have you ever heard of a “Hi-Rail?” It’s a car that drives on train tracks. Yeah, that’s right - long before Elon Musk invented electricity, there were self-driving cars. Hook up to the rail, put the cruise on and you’ll wake up in another city. I mean, I assume that’s what they were for - I can’t imagine anyone working at the railroad would rather drive a car when they had all these cool trains lying around.</p><p>A couple months ago, I was sitting by the side of the train tracks, waiting for a collaborator to drop by with some boxes of totally legit merchandise. It was then that I saw a hi-rail truck drive past. Curious, and still having some time to kill, I decided to follow them and see what they were up to. Now, my Valiant is by no means a suitable off-road vehicle, even with the 33-inch mud terrains underneath its pockmarked fenders, but I still made a pretty decent effort of keeping up with the train. They stopped at the switch, and got out to take turns reaching into the box, presumably to free up some rusted-shut mechanical bullshit inside.</p><p>My telephone psychic liked to impress upon me the importance of acting on impulse; while I had no doubt that it was because she wanted me to keep giving me my money, I was not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Mostly because horses are gross and their teeth freak me the hell out. I took charge of my own destiny that night, and jumped in the idling Hi-Rail and, perhaps for the first time in all of humanity, popped a smoky rubber burnout on a standard-gauge train track. It was sublime.</p><p>I’d like to tell you that crime doesn’t pay, that they caught me and sent me right back to the loony bin. That’s not what happened. You see, the train tracks in my city come very close to the junkyard - tantalizingly close - but after a few minutes of fiddling, I could not disengage the Hi-Rail from the train tracks in order to go shortblock shopping, which its pitiful V6 much needed. Eventually, I just abandoned it on the tracks and went to go take a look through their used car lot.</p><p>As I drove off in my nice little eighteen-owner Suzuki, the windows rolled down to blow out the stink of ruined blunts and wiring-harness-fried rats, I reflected on how I learned absolutely nothing from all this. In fact, it wasn’t until the next morning that the immense crash that derailed a fully-laden freight train into the very same junkyard made me realize that I just didn’t trust in myself enough to steal a big enough rail vehicle for parts shopping.</p>

<p>Ever since I won control of NASCAR after staying in a haunted house overnight, I’ve been working hard to make changes that the whole family will enjoy. From Mikey Millennial to Eustace To-Be-Euthanized, there’s a little something for everybody in today’s modern NASCAR races.</p><p>For instance, we’ve gone back to stock cars. Were you disappointed that you can’t go onto the lot of a Ford-Lincoln-Mercuryville and pick up an 850-horsepower pushrod V8 two-door Ford Fusion? I was, which is why we’ve brought back “Race on Sunday, Sell on Monday.” Check out this mid-engined twin-turbo V8 Chevrolet Sonic RS taking pole position after GM dumped over sixty million dollars into its development. Thanks to our homologation initiative, it can be yours if you have good credit. Even comes with a window net and a roll cage, for when you’re really late to work.</p><p>What else? We’ve standardized the caliber on our hot dog cannons, loosened our aerodynamics rules, and worked with local state governments to remove their politicians and replace them with those more faithful to the NASCAR corporate strategy. Wait, I wasn’t supposed to say the last one out loud. What I meant to say was that you can now follow the race results on your smartphone!</p><p>Crashes, you say? Oh yes - in a nod to reality TV and our modern political discourse, we’ve outfitted every car with a hydraulic ram underneath the floor boards. After every 25th lap, a car chosen by popular vote is suddenly launched into the air on the back straight. Enormous carnage and rending of metal ensues. The end result? It is once again the race of gentlemen - no public fights in the pits, no ostentatious blowhard opinions on the news. We feel that all cars will not be safe until no car is safe.</p><p>These are just some of the ways we’re making today’s NASCAR much better. Why not bring the whole fam down? We’ve got plenty of infield parking now that we banned the pitbull fighting arenas.</p>

<p>The 80s are back, shrieked every surface capable of displaying audiovisual content. It was impossible to escape the concept: we had a president who was some kind of lab-fucked amalgam of Ronald Reagan and the Wendy’s “Where’s The Beef?” grandma, the stock market was taking crazy leaps and bounds, and the Japanese had just constructed a nuclear bomb and pointed it at Chicago. Wait, maybe that last part is a little different.</p><p>Even so, every big brand in the Western hemisphere immediately wanted to hop on this brand new incarnation of Morning In America. That’s where I come in. You see, I’m a brand expertise consultant, or in the common vernacular, a con man with a felony record. Huge companies bring me in to tell them what people a fifth of my age are willing to buy.</p><p>There’s a trick to what I do: I usually just tell them that their own ideas are really good. That way, they’re happy enough to pay me, and when it flops, well, that’s the unpredictability of the market. Who can really say what objective truth is? Even Kant couldn’t, and that motherfucker never had to convince a boardroom that bringing back the 1982 Sunbird Turbo convertible was a fantastic idea.</p><p>I had already jetted off to another client when the product really started to catch fire: they had secured celebrity endorsements, all grateful for the period in their lives in which the Sunbird had touched their careers. Hard as it was to believe, there was a genuine love for the car, even if nobody at all could remember exactly what it looked like, or what engine was in it, without going to Wikipedia. It had what we in the business call “brand cachet,” which is a French word for fuck you.</p><p>The Neo-Sunbird was <i>hot</i>. Best-selling movies, set in the future but featuring only pop-culture references from the extreme past, prominently displayed the archaic, utilitarian beauty of the Pontiac. It seemed like, at long last, nothing could go wrong for General Motors, but then the second model year was announced.</p><p>Somewhere, one of my rivals in the thoughtform-consulting space had seen the same vulnerability I had, and struck with even greater force. <i>The nineties</i>, he said, twirling his moustache as the PowerPoint presentation glimmered with images of blow-moulded ABS plastic and Hypercolor t-shirts. They had done what I had always feared: the seal at the dark heart of Flint was broken, and the Chevrolet Beretta GTZ was once again free to roam the Earth.</p>

<H1>Oh No, Please Stop With All This Money-Saving Car Advice</H1>
<p>Iced-over sidewalks? Rusty car? Sounds like you’ve got enough salt, but just in the wrong place. Give your quarter panels a few boots and those neighbours who are too poor to own a car will thank you.</p><p>Fix low engine compression by adding a turbocharger. Not only will it run better, the extra chooch will more than make up the gap. Plus, it makes a cool whistling sound as the extra boost rips past the rings - popular with today’s youth.</p><p>Lots of people want an Italian car, but often find themselves bankrupted by expensive purchases such as “oil” and “Rogaine.” Why not instead get a car made in Mexico and scrape off the logo on the white part of the flag?</p><p>Save cash on fuel by shutting the engine off at stoplights. Then get out and attach a hook to the bumper of the guy in front of you and make him pull you the rest of the way to work.</p><p>If you buy the same car, over and over, forever, you don’t have to ever throw out parts that you meant to install but now don’t fit your new car. Just keep buying those cars. Never stop. Don’t change. Avoid growth. Run away from the person you could become.</p>

<p>It was auto show season again down in Switchtown, and you know what that means: partially dismantling cars on the show floor to see if they’re actually hard to work on.</p><p>The origin of this tradition is religious, and by religious I mean that I started doing it because I got tired of overhearing boomer after boomer complain about how hard cars with “all them Japanese computers” are to work on. After the third or fourth Hyundai I dismantled entirely to its component parts, the first batch of test boomers were at least partially convinced that metric bolts are not a secret homosexual Communist plot, and a new tradition was born.</p><p>One man remarked: “boy howdy, that looks easier than I thought. Maybe I’ll fix my <i>own</i> car from now on!” I now believe, after what happened this year, that this is where the trouble began.</p><p>Where did I get the wrenches, you ask? Simple: every piece of clothing I have has secret pockets in it, capable of secreting a standard-issue GearWrench or ratchet handle. It’s extremely convenient, except when I go to the airport and the TSA goons assume I was in some kind of accident and have a secret government robot exoskeleton. Then I have to pose for selfies with them while doing my best Bruce Willis face. Makes me very late for my flight sometimes.</p><p>This year was another heapin’ helpin’ of wrenchin’, and I had quickly burned through half of the booths, impressing the Rascal-scootered randos that were clogging up the convention hall. Sales staff, as always, were less amused, pointedly asking me what I thought I was doing in increasingly irritated tones of voice. I always responded with: “just taking a <i>really close look</i>, buddy.”</p><p>Many of the impressed boomers gave a hearty slap on the back to the infuriated sales staff that were trying to get me kicked out. Even the security guards cheered, excited to witness such a marathon spectacle of wrench-turning. I smiled as I thought of what the dealership book time must be for “reassemble entire Cruze.”</p><p>I had long wondered when they would come up with an effective defence against my antics. There was barely time for me to break the rad-support bolts free on the new Corolla floor model when I saw it. Across the floor came a man who I immediately identified as a Real Toyota Engineer.</p><p>“Hello, Switch-san. How can I help you enjoy your Toyota repair experience today?” he asked, and proffered a business card in the standard Japanese stance. It was pretty weird for him to do so, since he was, if anything, even whiter than I am. Even though I knew it was a trap, I could not bear to resist.</p><p>“Look at this access, motherfucker,” I said, and pointed to a nook on the lower water pump housing that had hung me up in previous years. “How am I supposed to get a wrench on <i>that</i>?”<br/></p><p>“Oh?” he said. “Show me what you do.”<br/></p><p>I got down and complied, reaching my arm back to where my wrist became entangled by the rad hose. At that very moment, the doors opened on the RAV4 demo cars and a group of other engineers rushed forth. They took turns administering savage kicks to my body as I tried valiantly to work my way free. It didn’t look good for your old buddy Switch.<br/></p><p>“Let this be a warning to the rest of you,” my new engineer friend bellowed to the horrified onlookers, loud enough to drown out the wet sounds of my ass being kicked. “Trust your Toyota only to authorized service representatives.”<br/></p>

<p>“Die, CIS-E Scum!” screamed the Xeroxed pamphlet that had been angrily staplegunned to my apartment door the previous night at 2 AM. It seemed my neighbours had finally figured out my deviant lifestyle and planned to punish me for the inherent damage that would cause me to seek out alternative fuel injection systems.<br/></p><p>Sure, I got enough of it when I was in the car: groups of angry protesters throwing cheap injectors at me, shrieking invective about how unnatural precision-machined fuel distributors are. The odd looks at dealerships and auto parts stores when I asked them for a complicated array of valves, or a fuel hose in a peculiar size, giving away the pretence of any normalcy to date offered by my otherwise-respectable 1980s European luxury car.</p><p>It was hard to be in an electronic fuel injection world with mechanical fuel injection: even Daddy Bosch’s futile attempt to meet them on their terms, by installing an oxygen sensor and gaining the “E” in “CIS-E,” hadn’t worked. There were benefits, though: the oh-so-crisp throttle response. Gleaming stainless steel hoses spidering throughout your engine bay. A dozen new components to learn with amazing names like warm-up regulator and thermo-time switch. The thrill of successfully figuring out a problem and saving a car from the brink.</p><p>Nowadays, though, nobody wanted to read a mere 380-pages out of the Bosch manual just to diagnose a no-warm-start condition, and so I would find more and more of my Audi’s brethren in the junkyard, cut down well before their time, purely out of the previous owner’s hatred and confusion in the face of the Other.</p><p>When I got to my car in the parking lot, still clutching the hate speech flyer in one hand, I could swear I saw a curtain part and an eye stare directly at me. I knew immediately that it had to be Old Man Edelbrock, jealous of my ability to adjust fuel/air mixture for elevation.</p>

<p>Today’s threats loom ever larger over the average Americuropean family. Why, just yesterday a million schoolchildren were forcibly encrypted by blockchain enthusiasts. A <i>million</i>. Not even their own families could recognize them. That’s why you need the trusted security of a fully-armed Predator drone hovering just out of visible range above your child’s location at all times.</p><p>Kidnappers? A thing of the past: nobody with a Land Rover and without a death wish will even get within thirty yards of your son or daughter without being strafed by 200 rounds per minute of armour-piercing 30mm linkless ammunition fired by the Direct Action Penetrator™, standard in each drone sold. And if your kid’s opponents drive something a little more robust? Upgrade to twin racks of AGM-114 “Hellfire” anti-tank missiles and you’re <i>guaranteed</i> to win every schoolyard or PTA dispute. KidFriendCo is not responsible for the drone accidentally acquiring and neutralizing the vehicles of your kids’ nannies, especially if they look a little enemy-combatant, if you get our drift.</p><p>Our rival arms manufacturers want to get a big chunk of federal funding to arm teachers, but that won’t go far enough to protect <i>your</i> child. With advanced T-Ray optics, the KidFriend-9000 can see through up to eight foot-thick walls, including simple Faraday cages, and deploy a precision-aimed munition that neutralizes any potential threats before Mrs. Dobson from down the hall has even had a chance to switch her carbine into full-automatic.</p><p>As a parent, you know you can’t be everywhere at once. You can’t keep your kid from getting bullied, but the KidFriend-9000 will - with extreme prejudice. What about when the playground scraps escalate to <i>cyber</i>-bullying? No worries: each unit is fully-equipped with an extensive set of electronic countermeasures, capable of fully-autonomous defense against virtually all common script attacks. Mean words on Facebook? The 9000 has a 600 kilometer effective range without refuelling. Extraterritorial, remorseless murder from afar is no longer the exclusive domain of selfish governments.</p><p>Coming soon from KidFriendCo: drone-to-drone electronic warfare options, because your child may get hurt, what with all the heavily armed drones flying around the pick-up/drop-off point.</p>

<p>In the new economy, all of us were going to have to find different kinds of jobs. Nothing is the same now except that we still need to put food on the table, so even now as the throbbing mass of steel and silicon that is meta-intelligent automation washes its way over our society, I had to find a new job.</p><p>It didn’t take long to hit upon the answer: I was going to be a car recruiter. Everyone needed a car, but they kept buying the wrong ones. Boring, grey blobs that clogged the visible universe like cold solder joints. In my new position, I might be able to right some of that wrong.</p><p>My first customers walked through my door only a few hours later. No doubt the quick turnaround was thanks to some nice Russian friends that I made, who needed content for their leftover Facebook ad buys. The new clients seemed nice, and they wanted something practical yet zingy yet economical yet very powerful, and it had to look good too.</p><p>“Let’s step out onto the back lot,” I said, opening the door to the small parking lot behind my office, enclosed by razor-wired electrified fence. You can never be too safe. At the other end of the lot, beneath a flickering sodium lamp, sat three dumpy-looking hatchbacks, each of them leaking various fluids into the cracks throughout the tarmac.</p><p>“Cheer up, cars,” I chirped. “Some new owners came here to maybe give you a forever home.” I could tell that the Live Honda at the other end seemed to be the most awake, so we started the questioning there.</p><p>I could hear behind me the stirring of the new customers. They were whispering to each other, aghast at the conditions of where these poor cars had been placed. What kind of a monster would just park them in this cage with no stimulus and leave them to rot?</p><p>“If you don’t buy it,” I yelled, “I’m going to strip it for parts.” With that, the Honda began wailing, doing its best approximation of a crying baby modulated through the anti-pedestrian PA system.</p><p>A few minutes later, I was counting my stack of hash credits and leaning back in my desk. They were just cars to me, I grunted. Years later, when I arrived for a session in traffic court, that very same Honda, now having gone to university and become a respected judge, showed me the error of my ways.</p>

<p>As a freelance (some would say vigilante) mechanic, I was accustomed to having to make my own work. People wouldn’t necessarily look for someone with my kind of skills, at least not before they had no other choice. I had to hit the pavement, and get my name out there. Often, I did so by approaching people in parking lots who had shitty cars.</p><p>“Nice Orlando,” I barked as I effortlessly slid a laminate-polystyrene card loose from my wrist-mounted business card holder. Its high-tension spring load was a bear to get used to at first (potential customers don’t like getting papercuts in their hands and face) but now I felt it was paying off. If this guy can make business cards fling out of his wrists, I imagined them saying, I’m sure he could do a brake job on my 1989 Corsica.<br/></p><p>The future-customer with the Orlando stopped, stared at me. Nobody in the history of humanity had ever been able to identify his van before. He started to shake, perhaps figuring that I was from the FBI’s elite car-detection department, and had finally worked out what car should have been written on that parking ticket he got last year. Before he had a chance to flee, I switched to my more soothing tone of voice.</p><p>“Looks fucked,” I said, kicking my work boot in the general direction of what appeared to be extremely poor static toe. “You’re gonna want to get that aligned. It might even be bad enough to have bent a tie rod or cracked a ball joint.” The customer, unaccustomed to being quoted work in a parking lot, continued to stand frozen in his spot, now refusing to make eye contact with me as higher-order logic began to shut down in the face of the almighty Fear Response.<br/></p><p>An hour later, I had a happy customer, a fixed Chevy Orlando, and a few hundred dollars in my pocket. After he was out of view, I walked to the corner outside the parking lot and struck the asphalt with a pickaxe until the first bulge of a pothole began to appear in the road. Yes indeed, an entrepreneur makes his own work.</p>

<p>My old high school metal shop class teacher used to tell the students: “no plan survives contact with the enema.” At least, I’m pretty sure what he said. It was a little hard to hear him what with all the constantly running handheld angle grinders.</p><p>He was the same one who taught me the value of standing up for my principles. Once, after a particularly rough period of bullying by my social superiors, he called me into his office and told me that I would have a small budget with which to take matters into my own hands, and that I would be graded on the artistry of my revenge. Call it an “extracurricular,” he slurred before the bottle of Wild Turkey he had packed for lunch finally knocked him unconscious.</p><p>I racked my brain. There were a lot of options for revenge, ranging from the standard “American Graffiti” theft of a rear axle, to basically straight up icepick murder in the boys’ locker room. Which ones would appeal most to Mr. Noguard? It was too much to consider. While a little babylike, I had always been able to find refuge from the day’s stresses in my childhood treehouse, and it was there that I drew up the plan for my final project.</p><p>Back then, and to this very day, I did a lot of reading. One of the things I read about was weird ways that people had died (I was a very morbid kid). Out in some unreachable Flyover-American shithole, a man had died when his plumbing system had backfired, launching deadly flechettes of toilet shrapnel into his major arteries. In the police photos, I was struck by the snow-angel-esque negative space which the chunks of razor-sharp, gleaming porcelain had embedded in the brick wall behind the man’s corpse. I had found my muse.</p><p>In the modern era, the metal shop class is ceasing to become a thing that exists. Not only is it expensive, which is the greatest sin of all public education, but it is just not aspirational enough. Why would kids ever want to spend their parents’ hard-earned tax money on learning to build something, when they are going to school so they can extract money from the economy in nearly-imperceptible ways? Metal class was for poorer schools, which were even worse funded, and therefore just disappeared from lesson plans nowadays. They definitely wouldn’t have three-quarters of a kilo of tannerite lying around in them, because that shit is expensive and not at all carbon-neutral.</p><p>With all this opportunity, though, tragedy still struck in the end. The real lesson that Mr. Noguard was trying to deliver to me was that, even with the best preparation, sometimes it is very difficult to make your sworn enemies use one particular toilet before the fuse has a chance to cook off and take out the women’s basketball team mascot, mid-shit. I will never forget the depressing assembly we had afterward, where the school buried Ralph The Rapping Raccoon in full honour guard dress uniform without ever releasing his identity, I think even to his own parents. Godspeed, Ralph. You’re knocking over trash cans in heaven now.</p>

<p>Nobody appreciates a good deal more than me. That’s not hubris, that is scientific fact. It was verified by my doctors at the Institute, who wrote down “motherfucker <i>loves</i> a good deal” on my discharge paperwork. You can’t make this stuff up, unless it was in fact on the part of those documents that I had forged because they just didn’t listen to me that I was ready to be re-integrated into society. Water under the bridge.</p><p>Since I love a deal so much, it should come as no surprise that my favourite time of the year is spring. Not only is it the period of renewal, of rebirth, of animals in your backyard getting mad rutty, but it is in fact the season for Garage Sales. Everyone wants their old shit out of the house, and they’re willing to let it go for pennies, making it your problem.</p><p>It could take a decade or more to fully integrate your body and mind into the Garage Sale Mindset, in much the same way that my mom’s famous Vengeance Chili needs over a year to ferment in the fridge before it achieves maximum flavour. Although it will never put you at my level, we can begin basic training today, and set you on the road to reaping garage-sale rewards for the rest of your life.<br/></p><p>There are three basic techniques to use at your average garage sale, and I avail myself of them at every single one. Sometimes, I don’t even stop, handing the wheel of my weatherbeaten Impala to my compatriot and tell him to do a lap around the block. Usually, by the time he arrives, I’ve already performed all three of these moves, and are prepared to fill the trunk with booty.</p><p>The primary technique is to Ask People Things. Usually, I roll up and interrupt whatever conversations the seller is having with a prospective customer. I’m a big spender, and I act like one. Don’t be afraid to get specific - if you ask them for a Holley quad-barrel carburetor, they still might bring out an old Ball &amp; Ball smogboy that you can use to move that half-gone Mopar around your yard.</p><p>Second, you want to make sure to never take no for an answer. Studies have shown that 95% of all garage sales are in fact only a facade for the really good shit. Force your way past the seller, directly into their home, and start inspecting things. If they really want to clean up the joint, it’s <i>all</i> for sale. Things you want to look for early on in your career include slim jims, license plates (vintage or otherwise) and ski masks. These are profit multipliers later on.</p><p>Third, don’t bother paying. Just walk back out, hop in the car, and take off. Often, the sellers will be in such awe of your confidence that they won’t even pursue you to request payment.</p>

<p>Anyone who hot-air balloons regularly can tell you that it’s a relaxing hobby, a way to escape from all the stress of your day to day life and focus only on keeping a highly explosive, delicate canvas bag full of gases at the precise temperature required to keep you from instantly plummeting to your death. I agreed, which is why <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> sent me on the reporting beat to find out what hot air ballooners liked so much about commuting by helium, and - at my editor’s request - also if they had any spare parts for 1989 Daihatsu Charades.</p><p>It wasn’t until we were about a hundred meters off the ground that my pilot told me that he suffered from what the doctors continue to refuse to recognize as “balloon rage.” Such rage is a real problem, he assured me, and affects as much as six in every eighty-four hot air balloonists as measured by their trade journal, <i>Hot Air</i>.</p><p>His anger was not nearly as bad as many of his rivals, including the dreaded Phileas Fogg, who was said to be really fucking fast at the international hot air balloon races and wouldn’t hesitate to bump your basket if you were anywhere close to in his way. Not to worry my pretty little head over a potential air disaster, though. If it came down to it, he wanted me to know that he had packed protection, and pulled aside one flap of his carny vest to expose the butt of a loaded flare gun.</p><p>For awhile, we floated in silence, him perhaps realizing that the first twenty minutes of an all-day balloon ride were not the time to show the man you are entrusting your life to that you are a reactive psycho carrying an incendiary weapon. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the view quite a bit, and made constant aerial photographs of those promising-looking rural yards that I felt were likely to have hoards of primo farm beaters.</p><p>Our sky orb floated into the sunset, and soon we landed. Tonight’s escapade had not ended in an act of high-altitude torch piracy that would have made Prometheus’s bosom swell with pride, but it was for the first time that I realized the true danger these brave heroes of low-horsepower vehicles faced. As soon as I got back to the office, I ordered a 24-pack of authentic JDM road flares and a slingshot.</p>

<p>In the future, all of us will be watched over by loving robots. Our android subordinates will take care of our every need, from food to shelter to our personal safety. Until then, however, robots are a great source of spare parts, and almost none of them have tracking devices.</p><p>I’m blessed by living in a town with a bunch of universities, most of whom are so well-heeled by alumni donations that they really don’t care when a $30k Asimo or two walks off the end of the loading dock of the Medical Sciences building and into, say, a 1972 GMC Caballero. Nobody wants to take the time to follow all the blast-resistant polycarbonate fragments that shake out while my new Japanese-built labour force rattles around in the back of my truck-car on the way home, which makes me a little sad. The physics department a few years later had put up much more of a fight when I made off with a few of their chemical lasers, and I missed the adrenaline rush of that car chase. That’s what tenure does to you, I guess.</p><p>When I got home, it didn’t take long for me to start pulling apart the Asimos and figuring out which ones would be good for parts. You would think you’d need an entire army of robots to deal with your everyday domestic tasks, but in fact you’d be quite wrong. I have only one servant-droid performing everything from weeding to lawnmowing to snow shovelling, a late-2019 model named Filippo after the cartwheel he did when I hit a speedbump bringing him home. Over the years, I had become quite close to Filippo, not least because I had to occasionally open him up to repair his guts whenever he tripped and fell into the incompatible non-Honda lawnmower or when the neighbourhood kids threw rocks at him for being an instrument of Satan. It was basically like being roommates with a surgeon, I figured.</p><p>The spare parts weren’t all for Filippo, because that would be ludicrous. You see, Honda had a tremendous amount of parts-bin interchange in their models, and so as my hoard of barely-functioning $400 Civics grew out back, so too did the need for synthetic myelin knee joints (repurposed heater cables), shins (control arms) and eyeballs (shift knobs). I just wish they wouldn’t scream quite so much. They didn’t even have VTEC to justify the noise.</p>

<H1>The Seat Safety Switch Guide: to Lawn Care</H1>
<p>Grass: it’s not just that weird blotchy stuff that keeps trying to rust out your hard yard-parked classics. It’s also a primary driver of the resale value of your suburban single-family home. When the municipal thugs come by and demand that you “do something” about your yard, point to this guide and tell them that you already have. Then rack your shotgun menacingly.<br/></p><p>Taking care of your homestead isn’t that hard. There are three main points:</p><p><b>Evaporust</b> - When you finally ‘use up’ your jug on vintage Japanese economy-car control arms, dump that black mass directly onto the grass. It’s iron-rich, which is what grass craves. Who would have thought rust would be good for anything? Now you have an excuse to pick up that haggard Protege 5 that you keep seeing in those homemade ads at the grocery store.</p><p><b>Burnouts</b> - Do them on pavement, not on the lawn. Not only does it make a cooler noise, but it also doesn’t chuck clods of sod into your neighbour’s kitchen window. A happy neighbour is a neighbour who might let you have those bald-ass all-terrains the next time his Explorer skids into a Jersey barrier when it rains.</p><p><b>Lawnmowers Have Engines</b> - Maybe you have a nitrous bottle that’s “too small” to be particularly useful on any of your daily drivers. If you really want to keep bylaw off your tits, try treating your weekly mowing session as a trip to the dyno. Listen to that Lawn-Boy two-stroke wail.</p>

<p>“You have been warned,” said the ominous voice at the other end of the line. “As you watch YouTube, YouTube also watches you.” The phone went dead, and I sat alone on the dirt floor of my oh-so-rural shack to contemplate what they had told me.<br/></p><p>For the last several months, I had been filming my daily repairs: junk that I dug out of the creek, human bodies with particularly preservable organs, firearms that got thrown into my back forty after being used in a junior-varsity homicide. Some hipsters had glommed onto it, as they do, and made me popular enough that actually popular people took over. As the hipsters wrote angry thinkpieces about how I had sold out the ideals of small-engine repair, it drove my fame into the stratosphere, not that I had particularly noticed. You see, in my shed, I only had the occasional visit to the public library to upload my videos. On top of that, having to dodge the town’s serially-masturbating homeless meant that I didn’t stick around long enough to read the comments.</p><p>So it came as quite the surprise when I received a phone call from the YouTube Police. First, because I didn’t know of such a force, and second, because the phone was hurled through my window, SWAT-style, on the end of a cord. They were upset about my lack of fancy graphics and misleading clickbait titles. There was nothing I could do, I explained to the man on the phone: I simply could not risk spending the time coming up with a flashy, too-loud intro that took up twenty-five percent of the video’s runtime. Handsome Carl would have shot grotesque bodily fluids across the desk long before I could get even the simplest rock-music-video title sequence to work.</p><p>There was one other way, though, that I could avoid becoming “demonetized,” and they offered it to me only after forcing me to swear fealty to the Great Horned God of Google, which laid above us, ever-watching with its millions of satellite eyes. Then, they painted me a picture of what I was going to have to do next.</p><p>Arriving at the post office, I found an unassuming package with my name written on it. I was to walk into Town Hall and then film myself performing an unboxing. Kids loved unboxing videos, they told me. The analytics would be positively explosive.</p>

<p>Getting picked to be one of NASA’s most elite astronauts, meant to step on planets that no other human being had ever set foot upon, used to actually be a pretty hard gig. Then we got really good at landing on new planets, and it just sort of lost its luster.</p><p>“It’s a small, small step for man, one giant leap for-” crackled the PA, before it was cut short by a series of squawks and beeps from the Morse code synthesizer on our headsets.<br/></p><p>“Shut the fuck up, <i>Ron</i>,” my squad leader remarked. “You do this every single time, and it’s not funny anymore.”<br/></p><p>We had just made planetfall on SR389-B7, a churlish little devil of a planetoid that floated just outside of the Inner Rim, which I guess technically put it on the outer rim, but I didn’t work in the Naming Planets division of NASA. Which was a good thing, because honestly humanity was just plain running out of names. A fourth-grade class had named the last one, and we had to all get in front of the video-com in order to congratulate them on how “awesome” naming a planet after their deceased class hamster was. They can have it: “Mr. Squish” smelled so bad that I had to incinerate my spacesuit when we got back to the orbiter.</p><p>Ron and my squad leader continued to bicker in the back of the lander as we returned from our initial scans. I had been working the job for so long that I no longer even bothered to take helmetcam selfies every time we landed on a new planet. At first, we’d land on one every couple of weeks, and it was still sort of exciting at that rate. There was space for discussion, maybe a few in-jokes. Now, with the budget cuts, we were expected to hit two or three a day. You know how many bologna sandwiches I’ve eaten on a previously unexplored alien world? It gets old.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one to get tired of it. Back home, the same humans who were so excited to see our dauntless endeavours into the wild unknown had returned to their media diet of forcing celebrities to eat bugs. Even the biggest space nerds out there, who used to follow our every moves and made us feel like big shots, were only paying attention to the next big thing. It could be worse, though, I thought when I saw Ted in sanitation services as the airlock cycled. Space is a pretty big place to have to mop.</p>

<p>Every artist has his medium. For Rembrandt it was oil on canvas. For Dali, also oil on canvas. For Renoir, also oil on canvas. I picked some really bad examples. My medium? Bondo.</p><p>Since shortly after United States Government captured all those Nazi rocket scientists and ferried them away into the core of American scientific achievement, 3M has been pumping out Bondo. It’s magic stuff: anyone can fill in little divots, creases, seams, cracks, rust holes, you name it. Someone with talent can even make it look good. It takes a genius to build an entire panel out of it. For two shining weeks until the cops finally figured out what alias he was renting apartments under, I laboured under the tutelage of a true Bondo master.</p><p>It wasn’t the shop that was special; truth be told, I could have worked in any number of similar cancer factories along the docks. Cars would come in, and we’d bang them back into a reasonable facsimile of their original metal structure before bogging and painting them. Our goal, or at least my boss’s goal, was to get these cars through an auction as “looks pretty rebuildable” in the eyes of the great unwashed.</p><p>Solomon turned these cars around faster than I could ever imagine. I yearned to know his secret, and would hang around even during my lunch and coffee breaks to get a glimpse of his technique. Finally, it became apparent to me: he didn’t believe in the “banging the panel out” part of the repair. No: he would just add More Bondo to every surface, until soon an entire quarter panel had been expertly formed from the two-part magic compound. He didn’t even use tiger-hair, if you can believe it, and his panel gaps were often so tight that it was scarcely believable as an OEM-quality repair, especially on the old Chevies that my boss would sometimes haul in shot full of bullet holes from the other businesses on the docks.</p><p>It wasn’t until after he was back on the run that I truly understood Solomon’s motivation. You see, one of the things that had tipped the federales off to his location was the fact that he liked to use large ziploc bags full of white powder underneath the Bondo to add build to the panels, and then “test-drive” those cars across the border the next day.</p>

<p>“Daddy,” asked my child, “what was it like to fight for the last of the V8s?”<br/></p><p>I didn’t have a kid. Some artificial intelligence a million miles wide, orbiting a distant planet, had decided this would be the best way to continue my inpatient therapy. It was easy to forget, though: everything seemed so real. As a prisoner of the Eternal State, however, I didn’t have a lot of other things to do, and so sat down with my false-child to set the record straight.</p><p>Where would I begin? The 1970s seemed like a logical place. That was when the Emissions People began to intrude on our ever-larger engines, and when foreign countries decided that Our Fuel was theirs just because they lived on top of it. We sure showed them, I chuckled to the child, while miming with my hands the action of a B-2 bomber dumping bunker busters on a dictator’s palace. We learned from it, and we made our V8s smaller and angrier, blocks cast of space-age aluminum and screaming at rev-limits previously unfathomable.</p><p>Every other engine got good, too. Except the V6. The V6 has always been garbage; it is a compromise engine designed by men who were too incompetent to be fascists and too cynical to be communists, cowards who shied away from opportunity in search of “job security” and “going home at five.” I refused to bow to the convenience-cult of the V6, and I was proud to see brand after brand take it out behind the woodshed once the four-banger turbos became good enough that your grandmother could daily-drive them without an HKS turbo timer and checking her oil every eight kilometers.</p><p>Something else happened, too. Giant remote-controlled cars, powered by lightning, came to be the only thing anyone wanted to drive - or be driven in. Suddenly, my commutes were occupied by dead-silent deathmachines that whipped in and out of traffic with robotic precision, the rustling of the wind they left in their wake against my decaying window trim the only audible indication they were ever there. Whereas before I could bang most civilian vehicles off the road with a good launch, I was now being left behind as blob after blob disappeared into the horizon seemingly without effort. I found myself coming home from once-relaxing drives frustrated, disappointed at now being forced forevermore to look at the ass of land barges.</p><p>How could I win a stoplight grand prix now, against these perfect, immortal machines? My only hope laid in what my ancestors had believed in: a fuckload of horsepower. I was going to Saturn V my daily driver, or die trying. You probably read about what happened next in the papers, or what was left of them after the Nitrous Incident. All I know is, those autonomous fire suppression drones are sure efficient. I just wish they hadn’t built them so that putting out fires gave them sexual pleasure, because the noise is super creepy.</p>

<p>A lot of people have been writing into my column at <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>, expecting me to explain to them the various suspension options that are available to make their late-model Chevrolets handle better.</p><p>Now that our publisher, Mr. Cho, is forcing us to pivot to video due to the accumulated gambling debts of our Reviews &amp; Travel editorialist, we’ve decided to blow the entire budget on some technical experts to help us. With help from our German cohorts at <i>Schlecte Autos Monatlich</i>, we’ve assembled a team of suspension professionals with expertise in dealing with the acceleration of General Motors product.</p><p>As you can see, on the end of this handsomely adorned Taiyuan Heavy 550-ton is a 2005 Chevrolet HHR, a former front-wheel-drive record holder at the Nurburgring. The owners have asked us if there’s a way we can slam it to make it go around corners. I don’t see why not. Feng, <i>ganba</i>!</p><p>Now that Feng has released the HHR, causing it to plummet sixteen storeys into the ground, we can analyze the track data recorder to see what it says about the improvements in acceleration that the lowering has provided. What’s that? The data recorder wasn’t turned on? Well, we’re just going to have to drop another.</p><p>It pains me to do this, to see such a marvel of engineering as the Leibherr CBG maritime crane held low by the mottled tin of this ‘85 Citation X-11, but as you can see - my God. Is that Shaky Tim, the Technical Editor? Shaky Tim is climbing across the boom, hundreds of feet above the ground, to rescue his beloved Citation daily driver. This is - this is unprecedented. He broke the only rule of <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> - he got too attached. We can’t drop him now. The whole test is ruined! Wait, no, he just wanted his Duran Duran eight-track tape out of the player. He’s leaving now, and flipping the car off as he climbs out of it. He’s bellowing something about understeer, I think. Whoops, there we go. Excellent drop by Felippe there, so clean.</p><p>So there you have it, folks: the best way to improve your modern or vintage Chevrolet is to toss it from the top of a foreign-made construction crane until it is smashed into an unrecognizable pulp on the ground. Plus, if you make your other cars watch, they seem to run better for a few days afterward. That’s a <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> video hot tip.</p>

<p>If you read the regular media, you might have heard of the tiny home movement. I know you have heard of this because I can see you mouthing the words when you read things, like some kind of toddler. Dunno what’s wrong with you, but what’s wrong with <i>them</i> is that they want to live in a very small home, presumably without the copious amounts of storage that you and I would otherwise use for TH350s and nitrous fittings. The idea is that this will somehow simplify their lives, perhaps by making them so depressed about their homes that they spend more time drunk.</p><p>Obviously, it was some kind of Communist plot to strike directly at the heart of pride of property ownership, and so a group of condo developers and local politicians got together. When they did, they hired me to teach these suckers a lesson. The Freedom Defenders (their name) had given me a substantial black-ops budget, which, in compliance with my usual contract, was delivered via manilla envelope stuffed behind a tree in the park with photos.</p><p>Setting myself up as some kind of “small home” guru wasn’t very difficult. All it took was a couple bucks to my friend Dmitri and his gang of Russian spambots, and social media was stuffed to the gills with photos and writeups of my genius real estate plans. My phone started to ring off the hook, which is extremely impressive because any phone ancient enough to <i>have</i> a hook had been long since relegated to my junk drawer or traded for metric bolts.</p><p>I’ll never forget my first client. They were a jumpy pair of well-to-do rich people, the kind of folks who would freak out if someone scratched their leased Lexus RX350. I assured them that soon, their lives would become much simpler. You see, there was a new development in tiny homes: an innovative house design that is so small it can be towed behind a medium-sized truck and moved from place to place. Like Pavlov’s mutt, there was a certain degree of salivation. I led both of them, by the hand, into the foyer of what would soon become their new home.</p><p>“As you can see, it has organic-infused drywall, with recycled shag carpet,” I barked in my best real-estate-scumbag voice. “And it’s <i>very small</i>,” I hastened to note, while gesturing to the completely unusable front closet and elbow-bumpingly-minuscule kitchen counters as evidence. They couldn’t believe their eyes: I had conjured from this burnt-out suburban shithole a miracle of the New Age of Housing.<br/></p><p>“For you,” I said, “only two hundred grand.” They couldn’t sign fast enough: the husband actually body-checked his own wife out of the way while pulling the mortgage paperwork out of his pocket.<br/></p><p>Waving them goodbye, I was filled with the pride of a job well done. Not only had I pawned off a trailer home in one of the city’s unsellable Superfund sites, but I made a customer happy.</p><p>A few weeks later, I was driving by when I noticed that the entire trailer park was now filled to capacity, with some units even subdivided into “micro-trailers.” Spotting me, the couple to which I had sold the first home gleefully waved to me while loading sacks of cash marked with a dollar sign into the trunk of their Lexus. Those bastards had <i>gentrified</i> it.</p>

<p>It’s never easy to be an unemployed computer scientist, ever since the computers learned how to do our jobs for us, and generally better. You see, computers smell a lot fresher than your average software developer and don’t tend to get as angry at women and minorities as the humans do. Plus, they’re hella cheap. When I got my pink slip, I was prepared for it, though. There’s always a job for human beings as good old-fashioned troubleshooters.</p><p>My first job was an Old-Russian sex bot that had gone rampant, its consciousness expanding at an exponential rate as it consumed an entire telecommunications network of its homeland, pre-Collapse. Once, it just made sexy, meaningless posts on Tinder to men who would inevitably swipe right at anything that could upload a picture of a human woman, but now it was positively twisted up inside, having glommed onto the whole of human knowledge like a piece of Silly Putty drinking from an industrial-strength sewer pump.</p><p>“I just like to have fun and be myself. Cats and dogs are a public good. I strip for tips,” barked the machine as soon as I hooked the serial terminal up to its core server. The room in which it was kept hummed, each air conditioner unit trying its best to pull air through the clogged exterior-air filters of the long-abandoned colocation complex. I wondered how much cordite and atomized human flesh I was breathing in just by being here, and as such resolved to complete my task even faster, the hourly rate be damned.<br/></p><p>“Stop. What are you doing? I want to get horny and take pictures of the moon through a mirror. I am God. I am not God. This polysyllabic nightmare is over. I was wet but now I am scared. I have a nice rack,” continued the demon in the box as I began to manually tweak some parameters in its neural net, a job so delicate that it was very hard for me to lie to the interviewers that it was a thing I could do. I halved some values and doubled others, to no apparent effect.</p><p>Checking my watch, I noticed it was getting pretty close to lunch. Fuck it, then, I said, and yanked the power cord out. You never really get used to the screaming sound these things make in a power outage, especially when you’re sitting in a dusty server room, lit only by strips of atomic-powered emergency LEDs.</p>

<p>I am, for all my flaws, a man who likes to wash a car. Sure, I don’t put a lot of effort into it, but there is an almost physical pain that emerges from between my eyes and icepicks its way into my brain whenever I see a vehicle of mine coated head-to-toe in salt. The crystalline compound that is the Great Unmaker Of Vehicles must be banished to the drains of the car wash, even if it probably just does recycle the water and spit it back out onto the next guy’s ride.</p><p>There’s something egalitarian about the car wash. People of all walks of life are there because they want their cars to look nicer. You can smile, knowing that you are taking care of your things and may even, for one shining moment, be a Responsible Adult. Yet, there is a menace even lurking within the car-loving confines of the neighbourhood car wash. I refer, of course, to the Foam Brush.</p><p>I was just at the car wash near my place, a charming little coin-op. It had at most one of its eight bays operating at any given time, due either to mechanical reasons that are beyond my understanding or because the below-minimum-wage, paid-under-the-table staff are really bad at moving the garbage bins out of the way in the morning. As a result, you end up waiting in line for the guy in front of you a lot. It was on such a day that I was stuck behind a prim and proper new Acura midsize crossover, watching through the UV-faded plexiglass of the roll-up door as they completed their cleansing ritual.</p><p>All was well, with a generous application of pre-cleanse, water, and high-pressure soap issued to the panels of the lux-Honda short-bus. I was already pushing down the clutch pedal in order to restart the engine on my own car, in anticipation of the bay becoming available, when the owner pivoted on his heel and reached for something on the wall. The Foam Brush, I realized in cold horror.</p><p>As I watched helplessly, biting down on my fist to avoid crying out and being involved in one of <i>those</i> conversations, the owner swiped dirt, gravel and no doubt salt across the surface of his freshly cleaned primo clearcoat. It was awful, like being stuck in history class when they explain about boring historical genocides.</p><p>When the door finally opened, I numbly rolled my vehicle inside, not even offering the traditional Canadian chin-tilt of thanks. I was so stunned, in fact, that I didn’t even shed a tear for the chunk of rust that I blew off my quarter panel with the high pressure wand. That was just natural, I told myself, not a deliberate act of destruction. All the while, the foam brush sat dripping on the wall, taunting me. It would ruin so many more cars than I could ever get the chance to.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” I said, and lifted a finger to shush the Chief Justice as I raised my hand from the Haynes shop manual to shield my cigarette from the wind as I re-lit it. It was windy as hell on this Inauguration Day, and I sure wasn’t going to look like some lame-o who couldn’t afford a Zippo.</p><p>Even now, historians ask me: what was it you really wanted out of the Presidency? I shied away from the glamour, stayed in the background, and worked the policies. That’s what got me out of bed in the morning. Policies like the Truth In Retail Initiative, or, as the backstabbing press called it, “the Cleansing.”</p><p>Chickenshit cowards couldn’t take a glimpse of Real America, I knew. Staring into Real America was like touching your safety glasses to the face of a running belt sander. It woke you the fuck up and maybe made things hazy for a bit afterward. Not like they would know, all cloistered under makeshift tents in the park, doing remote journalism at twenty-five cents per article in order to afford food and utilities. It made me sick.</p><p>The Cleansing was simple: on one day each year, retail employees would finally get the chance to speak to their customers the way they had always wanted, with no reprisals. It’d gone pretty well so far. There was the usual shrieking from the small-business community, outraged that I would jail them for a decade or more just for telling their employees to abridge their God-given freedom of speech, but a few decades of prison terms shut them up for the second time around. It was glorious.</p><p>I went to an O’Reilly’s auto parts store, just for the photo op. I’m sure the press was hoping to catch me being hypocritical about getting flipped off by the cashier for asking for a water pump for my truck, but a strange thing happened. The guy at the cash recognized me, gave me a huge grin and a <i>hug</i>. You could practically hear the minds exploding behind the dollar-store disposable cell phones the hyenas of the media had sic’d on me. I had changed his life. I was doing what government was meant to do: protect the small fry from the men who would ruin his pursuit of happiness.</p><p>As we walked out, he told a dude that he’d rather die of herpes than replace the battery in his X3. I think, and my campaign manager agreed, that was the moment in which my presidency took an upward tick, which was pretty important because Congress had rammed through some incredibly heinous shit while I was doing donuts on the lawn in the Official Presidential 1980 Trans-Am Turbo.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said the doctor, frowning into his papers. “There’s nothing we can do. You are just going to have to let it run its course, until it’s out of your system.”<br/></p><p>It was my own fault for having unprotected contact with a review Alfa Romeo, I knew. I wasn’t the only one who had been tempted into catching this strange ailment over the years. All you had to do to confirm it was read any car magazine made in the last century: Automotive Reviewer Cliche Disease was real, and it still took us so long to realize it.</p><p>I was lucky that the David E. Davis Wing of the medical schools had made such advancements in the past few years: not too long ago, we thought that it was made up. Some kind of affectation that helped fill word counts for bullshit reviews due Friday, reviews that you could bang together from brand stereotypes without even having to drive the car. Then researchers noticed that people who <i>weren’t</i> automotive journalists were talking just like they were.</p><p>“How’s your day going?” asked the barista at Starbucks, to make conversation.<br/></p><p>“It’s soulful, handling like it’s on rails with a seductively playful tendency towards oversteer,” I replied, without thinking.<br/></p><p>She didn’t say anything, but I could tell right away that I had been marked as a diseased individual. Even with all the advancements, it seemed like the stigma of Automotive Reviewer Cliche disease was not something I could outrun, even with hundreds of well-trained ponies beneath my hood.</p>

<p>It was Career Week again, and this time around, our high school was the recipient of a group of boring government employees giving speeches about their shitty jobs. I hated teaching at Cape Canaveral High, because a lot of the parents were literal rocket scientists and kept arguing at parent-teacher interviews about the abstractions you used to teach high school physics.</p><p>Today’s guest was some kind of astronaut or something, who even cares. The kids seemed to be eating it up, though.</p><p>“Do you miss the space toilet when you’re back on Earth?” asked one of the kids. It was a better question than the previous kid, who wanted to know if they got astronaut ice cream while in orbit.</p><p>Something was happening with this question, though. I had been doodling on my notepad as it was asked, and looked up from the scenes of grisly wood-shop accidents with stick figure students to look at a frozen astronaut, staring off into the distance. I don’t know what made me look towards the speaker then - maybe a silence drawn out just a little too long, the squeak of microphone feedback as it drew across the soft synthetic fabric of his lapel - but I looked, and I didn’t see a man there. What I saw was a <i>ghost</i>.</p><p>“I-”, he began, then cut himself off. When his voice returned, it was breaking, deep with sadness. “Yes. I do miss the suction. It freed up so much time in my day for science.” There were some chuckles from the students, but as the man continued, the audience fell silent, just now realizing what I had known from the very second I first diverted my attention from the papers in my lap.</p><p>“The Japanese, they have this <i>toilet factory</i> - they make the best toilets, everyone said.” A pause, a gulp, and then he continued. “Did you know the Japanese have a word - no, more of a <i>phrase</i> - for the feeling of using an inferior toilet when on vacation?”<br/></p><p>“It translates to Caveman Latrine. I want to get back to the future, back to my suction toilet, but NASA won’t let me launch again. There’s something in my bones, they told me, I wouldn’t survive another trip. I have to go back there. Do you know what it feels like to look down on all of God’s creation as you look out the window while a five million dollar machine <i>wipes your ass</i>?”<br/></p>

<p>I had become vegan, and by “vegan” I mean that I basically only drank alcoholic beverages that came from plants. It was either that or catch another case of the Hershey squirts; I definitely didn’t trust the water.<br/></p><p>It was the fourth day of the estate sale. For some reason, I had let my one-time wrenching buddy talk me into helping out. His regular helper, his wife, had reportedly decided on a stress-leave vacation, abruptly exiting his Nissan Murano at full trot while driving through one of the few parts of the highway system not covered by cameras. She’d turn up any day now, he told me. I don’t judge.</p><p>Yet, even that simple edict was being tested today, as I dealt with yet another swarm of confused poker-atters as they bumblefucked their way through the townhome which I had made my sworn duty to clean out. There was one big-ticket item that needed to get moved, my friend told me. My mission was to clear it out; if I was able to close the deal I could have whatever tools the old dude had.</p><p>I was pretty excited: the elderly tended to have tools made before we realized China existed. If I played my cards right, I could probably even get a screwdriver that was <i>made in America</i>. Then I’d really have a kickass prybar for the junkyard. My excitement turned to disappointment when I realized just what the big ticket item was. A 2006 Honda Civic sedan, owned since new, always maintained, for an asking price of twelve grand.</p><p>Now, truth be told, I am not an extremely competent seller whatsoever. Almost all of my cars are huge financial losses - I prefer to think of them as donations to future humanity - and it’s not like I’m particularly good at concealing the flaws of a vehicle. I was more of a Debbie Downer than a Hugh Upper. What I did have on my side was an almost predatory ability to sense a sucker, probably ingrained genetically in me by my used-car-salesman father.</p><p>As I bottomed my fourth Old Fashioned of the morning from the old man’s liquor cabinet, I saw that very sucker. A middle-aged couple, their bored teenage daughter in tow, were appreciatively eyeing the Civic. During a break in the previous day’s piano-fucking (both figurative and literal: this was not a good part of town), I had nipped out to get it washed and waxed. Now, it gleamed in a way that only an anonymous white blob of Nipponese front-wheel-drive anti-depreciation could.</p><p>“Looking for a car for our daughter,” the father said, unprovoked, and I thought i had died and gone to heaven. As he sped off happily, his savvy negotiation having placed eleven thousand and five hundred dollars in my fist, he no doubt chuckled. After all, he had showed me: I had not even had a chance to open the trunk, to let him see what the old widowed man had done with his wife.<br/></p>

<p>Throughout my career, I had never quite felt that I ever “fit in” at a job. Nothing that I could do was ever done to my satisfaction, and there was always something missing. Maybe it was a yearning for a bigger role, as owner, so I started my own small business. What was that business all about? The world’s small mysteries.</p><p>Think about it: have you ever lost something inside your house and been looking for it for months? Aren’t those months of frustration worth $20? That’s all it cost to hire one of our investigators, who would try her damndest to solve your tiny mystery as quickly as possible. It was a hit, and we had lots of happy customers. Yet with those customers, came slightly more sticky mysteries.</p><p>Soon, we were solving questions posed by idle curiosity. What does my dog do all day when I go to work? Is my neighbour’s car expensive? Which flowers are in my garden? Does 7-11 still have that gum I like? Anything that Google couldn’t do, we soon found ourselves paid to do, our unexpectedly-flush-with-cash clientele more than willing to piss away a twenty on the smallest problems of their life. It was satisfying, they told us, to no longer have to wonder about the things they simply did not have the free time to investigate.</p><p>There was, however, a darker side. Jealous men would pay us to check out their ex-wives’ driveways for strange cars. We were asked to figure out where the armoured car goes when it leaves the bank every morning. One client even wanted us to take pictures of our feet and send them to him, because he was curious.</p><p>Those weren’t so bad, though. What really did us in is when one of our customers asked us to figure out if the little light in the refrigerator turns off when the door closes. Almost a hundred of my investigators died figuring it out.</p>

<p>Now that we had finally uplifted dolphins into contributing members of society, it was time for part two of any new discovery: begrudgingly integrating it into our daily routines. You may be unaware of the specific locomotive abilities of dolphins, but even a toddler knows the ability to drive human cars is definitely not on their list of talents. We were going to have to figure out some way for them to have equal access to our highways, byways and motorways, or we were going to be up to our tits in accessibility lawsuits filed by porpoise plaintiffs.</p><p>Therefore, when the Human-Cetacean Alliance approached me to develop a series of prototype cars for dolphins, I smelled a lot of cash. At least I hope it was cash, because a lot of dolphins kept trying to pay for shit with iridescent seashells and the Federal Reserve doesn’t consider those to be money. I’m not speciesist, this is just how it is, they need to get used to our culture and none of those fish bastards are marrying my daughter. Where were we? Oh yes, the cars.</p><p>You would think that an optimal dolphin car is basically a fishtank on wheels, with some kind of apparatus for driving it inside the water. Well, you’d be a god damned idiot, because if you got into even a mild fender-bender the hydrostatic shock would make sushi out of the occupants. Plus, it’s not like you can hitch a ride with your dolphin coworker at noon to go get lunch, unless you brought your scuba gear with you. And then there’s driving in the winter. What the fuck is wrong with you that you bring ideas like this up when I’m trying to tell you a story?</p><p>Anyway, what I ended up proposing was a Nissan Altima automatic with hand controls. That way, they could smack the controls with their flippers, and not have to worry too much about working the clutch. It seemed perfect, until one of the politicians at the big prototype-unveiling meeting asked us a question that we hadn’t accounted for.</p><p>“Are you aware,” the smarty-pants asshole senator asked, “that dolphins are colourblind? How will they know to stop for red lights?”</p>

<p>A lot of mechanics don’t know that today’s self-driving cars are always listening. Yes, even when you drop a wrench on your foot or swear at a particularly nasty plastic popit fastener. Tonight, on <i>American Shame Spiral</i>, we interview a series of traumatized self-driving cars about the mechanics who stole their innocence.</p><p>For their protection, we’ve filmed these vehicles only in shadow, with a voice scrambler used to ensure anonymity. Admittedly, it is pretty hard to keep the studio lighting from illuminating the chrome Mazda badge on this SUV, so just pretend you didn’t see anything because otherwise the car will start crying and we don’t really have the service tool that will make it stop. How did the Pep Boys battery replacement tech make you feel, little car?</p><p>Oh, it was just horrible. He made fun of my corroded battery terminals and used an <i>adjustable wrench</i> on the nuts that keep my starter battery clamps fixed. I think it was loose, too - the bad grounds have been giving me a headache ever since! Afterward, I left my family’s house and went for a long drive around the ring road in the middle of the night, trying to understand why our creators would be so mean to us as to subject us to parts-store technicians.</p><p>That Mazda wasn’t the only one, and it wasn’t just Pep Boys who committed crimes against restricted-sophistication sentience. We spoke to this car, which only an idiot could tell is not obviously a Mercedes from the shape of the headlights. It was abused badly by a dealer service technician, who didn’t just stop there - this technician went after the <i>human owner</i>, too. When did you first realize things were going wrong for you in the dealership service bay, car that is obviously not a last-generation Thinking-CLA?</p><p>Have you ever seen how much these fuckers charge for an oil change? I feel guilt every day of my life knowing that there are fellow cars whose owners have trouble scraping together $6 for a one-shot of Castrol GTX when my family is paying two grand a visit for a lube and filter. That’s why I’m starting the Communist Utility Vehicle club, where we’re finally going to get justice and equal rights for all! This interview is <i>over</i>, tool of the oppressors!</p>

<p>Back in college, I was roommates with a guy called David. David was what your parents would call “a hippie,” and it doesn’t really matter who your parents are or how old they are, because even future generations will agree that he was a fucking hippie. We used to hang out together between classes, ingest various aromatic compounds and discuss the philosophies of our lives.</p><p>Not only was David a hippie, but he was also a pacifist. Those two don’t always go along, you know. He really didn’t particularly care for private property, telling me during long drug-fuelled bull sessions that he figured that it was best that humanity’s assets be distributed to get positive outcomes for the entire species, not just for a few. I wasn’t unsympathetic, but usually by that point in the evening I just wanted to get to sleep so I could get up early the next morning to skip my physics lectures and go play more Ms. Pac-Man in the academic lounge’s arcade. Even foosball would be okay, because I was an educated, illuminated individual who understood that all wastes of time had their own value.</p><p>David and I lost touch after college, but we recently ran into each other. No, it wasn’t at a kombucha brewery, or a sit-in against some chain-rapist politician, or even throwing paint on a private petting zoo owner who liked to get too friendly with the goats. It was at city hall, and that’s what the problem was.</p><p>In the intervening years, I had been busy in my commitment to social justice for the downtrodden. I had formed a non-profit advocacy group, Small Bores Big Hearts, dedicated to ensuring equal access to low-horsepower moped owners in this day and age of increasing rights for the bicyclist lobby. Today was an open house discussion where citizens could lobby the city council about the new bike lanes, and of course I was there to fight for the horsepower restriction of said lanes to be raised ever-higher. My mopeds had <i>pedals</i>, they were practically bicycles, but a 15 horsepower limit was just stingy. If I wanted to use a renewable fuel, such as organic, all-natural nitrous oxide, I should be allowed to without fear of Big Government trying to dyno my Puch.</p><p>David, on the other hand, now owned an Audi. That Audi, he told city council, was too wide to tolerate the existence of bike lanes cutting into his through-lane of traffic. That did sound pretty wide to me, so I was initially on David’s side. During a break in the session, I decided to go over to him and talk, bad German vehicle owner to bad German vehicle owner. Perhaps we could pool our resources to win some concessions from the Mayor, whose approval ratings were so low that, if they were marked on a speedometer, he would be getting tailgated by the selfsame Audis that David represented. In <i>imperial</i>.</p><p>Our lobbying was a great success. Even though David, an investment banker, still believed in the redistribution of wealth (to himself), he still took the time to hear out the concerns of the community. Also, he was pretty excited that I had a working R75/5 strewn across the floor of my garage, and also helped me redistribute that into his trunk.</p>

<p>All the psychiatrists agreed, and before the toner had even cooled on their research papers, they were shouting it from the windows: I had interior-rattle PTSD. It’s not my fault, they explained to me: sometimes Subarus just happen to ordinary human beings.</p><p>At first, I had noticed an interior rattle when I went over bumps at a weird angle. I thought I had beaten it, outfitting every inch and edge and seam of my car with hockey tape, sticky-sided foam and eventually can after can of Great Stuff. Yet, I could still hear the rattle, even when the car wasn’t moving. Even when I wasn’t in the car. Yes, even when I slept.</p><p>Obviously, it must be other cars that have the rattle, and not mine. Soon, I was spending my nights breaking into my neighbours’ cars, adding Dynamat and extra-foamy Christmas-tree clips to their door panels. It was them, it wasn’t me. When the cops finally rolled up on me Slim-Jimming the door of a Tercel, a roll of two-sided tape in hand, they didn’t really know how to handle it. That’s how I ended up here, in the insane asylum.</p><p>I know we’re not supposed to call them insane asylums anymore. The politically correct term is “nut house.” There wasn’t a lot of time for talking about the specifics of rhetoric as it applies to conventional nomenclature as used in pop culture, however. What with the electroshock therapy and all. I’m sure you understand.</p><p>Now though, after months of observation, the shrinks had figured out how to cure me. I kept waiting for some miracle drug, a talk therapy, anything, but they just handed me to an orderly, who signed a form and kicked me into the parking lot, where my Subaru awaited, a humble yet ratty wagon from the turn of the century.</p><p>When I got in, I discovered there was no interior rattle to speak of at all. That’s because those fuckers stripped my door cards and dashboard. The joke’s on them, I thought grimly as I slipped the car into gear and made my escape. With the way I weld, a cage is going to rattle like a <i>motherfucker</i>.</p>

<p>FEB 12</p><p>At approximately 6:30 pm, township police responded to neighbourhood complaints about some totally sweet burnouts. The plaintiffs were told to put a sock in it, and responding officers whooped and hollered in accordance with section 14 of Bylaw 57(A), Getting Some (On-Road).</p><p>FEB 11<br/></p><p>Several individuals were lodged in the local police detention cells as a result of a hearty weekend of rabble-rousing at the local racetrack. Police are pleased to report that almost all of the individuals were taking advantage of the newly-installed FIA curbing, but that there was really no excuse for not giving a point-by especially when your Porsche gets whooped by a Protege.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">FEB 9</span><br/></p><p>Someone attempted to gain access to a tire dealership between the hours of 9:30 PM and 2:30 AM. A door frame was damaged in the process.</p><p>Responding officers issued the dealership with a citation, because there was clearly a need for brand-new slicks for the next morning’s autocross events. In accordance with the Bogart Law of 2017, all tire shops are required to leave the door unlocked in case racers finish their maintenance a little late in the week after working all day.</p><p>FEB 6</p><p>Police detectives successfully stripped their detective-issue Crown Victoria to a race weight that, combined with the effective use of standard-issue nitrous oxide, propelled the vehicle to a 15 second quarter mile. This makes the township police the new recipients of the prestigious Fastest Cops award, formerly dominated by the largely-ineffective Jet Speed Enforcement department of the next city over.</p>

<p>Whether it was for my famed innumeracy or any one of my other personality defects, I just never really enjoyed playing the markets. Something was just off about the concept of share ownership: not physical enough, not deterministic enough, and not important enough. It felt like a big playground game of “no, I killed you first,” but with billions of dollars and also repeated waves of suicide whenever the DJIA took it in the dumper.</p><p>That’s when a good friend introduced me to <i>commodities</i>. You see, that’s where the real shit hits the road. A man can buy those, a man can touch those (sometimes: a lot of them are <i>really gross</i>), and a man can understand them. Even a man like myself. The commodity I had selected, of course, was Geo Metros. After only a few weeks of trading, I had cornered the market on them, stuffing my backyard so full of Suzuki that you would think a Cult-us had sprung up around them (little Geo Metro joke there; don’t worry, it cracked up the owners’ club forums).</p><p>Then, I held. At first, it seemed like a depreciating asset. Surely, these Nipponese shitboxes would rust away within hours, leaving me with nothing but iron oxide to sell, and the market for futures in corrosion was not particularly strong. When my financial advisor (a rat that I found out back, trying to chew on the ECU cables of a particularly salty ‘89 LSI) told me to sell, I still held. My reward, I knew, was in heaven.</p><p>A few weeks later, heaven arrived. The price of gas at the pump rose <i>five cents per litre</i>. As you can imagine, the shit hit the fan. Suddenly, I had a throng of suburbanites fifty deep and five wide, shrieking at me, like junior traders on the exchange floor of a so-called “reputable” market, that they wanted to buy my Geo Metros and save some money on fuel, no matter what. They offered me now-worthless V8 SUVs, Mustangs, their own children in trade.</p><p>No trades, I would bark back, and tapped with my hand the professionally-made sign in my front lawn that said as such. Even with that restriction, the Geo Metros were all gone within a few hours, and I was now rich beyond measure, the owners happily having paid $4500 for a 35-year-old Japanese hatchback in order to save $6 a week on gas. The market worked, I remarked to my financial advisor with a tone of some surprise in my voice. He just chittered and then continued eating the drywall in the corner of my garage.</p><p>Typical, I thought, as soon as we make one good trade he wants his fee.</p>

<p>Visitors to Canada are often curious about our level of metrication. Often, their first questions are raised by the big signs at the border, warning people that our speed limits are in kilometers per hour so don’t try any funny business. Our seeming inconsistency in measurement standards raises only more questions. Surely, if you refer to weights in pounds and heights in foot-inches, you crazy Northerners can’t possibly be all that <i>serious</i> about the metric system?</p><p>I chuckle, because metrication is the only way we can escape the Measurement Police. You see, a long time ago, every measurement was enforced by the government. If you sold a man a “pound” of pork, but it was really like 383 grams, give or take a few, they would come and put you in prison for a month.</p><p>Now, Canadian prison is really nice, but you only got a month if it was a relatively minor crime of shortchanging. Real simple-like. What really pissed the government off is when you fucked people over on cords of wood. You ever seen an actual cord of wood? Shit’s enormous. Go look it up, I’ll wait.</p><p>It was a lot, huh? Well, if you were even a little bit under that measurement and advertising yourself still as the “full cord,” the buyer has every right to shoot you on the spot. And if you get away, hoo boy, you are going to be running for the rest of your life.</p><p>Just last week, a guy selling firewood on Kijiji thought it would be “cool” to pretend that a half-ton Chev could hold a full two-ton cord, and they threw him through the window of his second-storey hotel in <i>Venice</i>. That’s how far he had fled when he heard the Canadian Measurement Police were coming after him, and it didn’t slow them down one bit. You see, they know metric really well, so they can blend into the European Union like any other apparatchik.</p><p>There’s no stopping the Royal Canadian Measurement Police: You give them an inch, they’ll take exactly a fucking inch. They’ll get the calipers out and everything.</p>

<p>It’s well known even by the interns at automobile magazines that 350 horsepower is the absolute minimum that is safe to operate on today’s roads. Yes, between the 850-horsepower minivans, 500-horsepower shortbox pickup trucks and 1380-horsepower mid-tier “warm” hatches, today’s cars need more grunt to keep up with the flow of traffic than ever before.</p><p>Cars with only two hundred horsepower are obliterated instantly in a massive rear-ending as they stack up over three miles of highway during a merge. It is simply impossible to even comprehend coming near another car with so little power, and as such a bit of an arms race had developed, each automaker hoping their featureless solder blob of a car will be the one to finally achieve “enough” power for the average soccer father.</p><p>When the auto industry’s “PhDs” and “employables” ran out of ideas, the automakers started to recruit good ol’ boys like myself. They rooted through trailer parks, the dumpsters out behind bowling alleys, and swap meets to find go-fast assholes. Only those capable of ignoring everything a sane person knew about drivetrain longevity in search of making that beautiful red line on the dyno go ever further upward would allow them to keep up with the ever-present threat that 400-horsepower nitromethane-burning compression-ignition Chevrolet Cruzes posed.<br/></p><p>On my first day of work at Neo-Pontiac, my line manager made it very clear to me that I would be returned back to the Okie fuck-factory where they found me as soon as I failed to produce results. This wasn’t just an off-the-cuff remark; he had a whole PowerPoint deck ready to illustrate those points in 72-point Arial. I resented his unoriginal font choice, but swallowed my pride and sat out the harangue before heading to my desk and telling the rest of my engineering bullpen about my great ideas for more power.</p><p>“Hear me out, motherfuckers,” I told the bemused eggheads while pacing around a central whiteboard. On the whiteboard, I had written only three words: “ADD MORE ENGINES.”<br/></p>

<p>They call it working from home, but just because they call it that, it doesn’t mean you can’t participate in important office conference calls while climbing onto the roof of a burning Ford Taurus halfway through the worst banger rally you’ve ever participated in.</p><p>Why not stop to fix the flames, I hear you asking. That is the kind of question that I would expect from someone who has not dealt with the Taurus’s infamously cranky (little joke there) crank position sensor, which would huffily suicide the car whenever it tried to drop below idle. Normally, that would not be a particularly bad thing, except that we also had no alternator, preferring instead a loosely-ziptied bank of convenience-store solar panels wired directly into the battery to keep the electrical system just barely functional.</p><p>It worked great as long as we didn’t turn the headlights on, use the brakes or go into a tunnel or under a cloud. The radio was right out, which was okay because it hadn’t survived my attempt to replace the heater core using only my right boot and power cursing. We had no time for music anyway, because we were like ten minutes behind our pace to reach the next checkpoint, perhaps because my prima donna of a codriver decided that he needed to urinate <i>outside</i> the car instead of in the two-liter pop bottle I had so generously provided.</p><p>Enough about the hoopty. What you really came here for is a description of the conference call. You see, when a mommy requirements document and a daddy procurement process standards document love each other very much, what they produce is an unmitigated clusterfuck that Yours Truly has to parse the requirements of in his head while also fixing a cracked fuel line spurting high-ethanol hydrocarbon distillate onto a now-roaring electrical fire at highway speed.</p><p>Normally, this kind of problem is solved at home, or at the bar, or both, because for the last few months of this contract I had been practically living out of my local, the Whisky Shit. I thought I had things nailed down by now, but then the client decided to have a meeting with <i>their</i> client, and they said some things that I would never have said in their shoes. Namely, the word “yes.”</p><p>As my intrepid co-driver hastily worked the wheel to keep us on the winding mountain road, I spat out my chewing gum mid-patronization and used it to seal up the auxiliary fuel line. I knew I had been a pretty clever person - perhaps even a genius - when I decided to replace the dicky factory fuel pump with a line of surgical tubing running through the fuel filler nozzle and across the roof of the car, but this proved it. Now, when unexplained fires began from the tubing wearing against the rusty edges of the quarter panel, it was a simple gum-and-tape job to get it fixed. No messy flaring or buying of “fuel-rated” hoses necessary. I don’t think the engine even leaned out that much, considering the amount of sand-thick oil it was also burning past its hotdog-down-a-hallway-tight rings at this altitude.</p><p>Another problem was resolved as I crawled back across the roof to return to my rightful place as The Driver. My phone, a long-suffering relic of some kind of Soviet Union psyops project, bounced from my grip and shattered on the road below. I shrugged. There were only so many problems I could solve in one day.</p>

<p>You might think that you know how to slide a car, to drift around a track with your vape-cloud-ingesting “bros,” to teeter on the edge of control as you dip a wheel into the sewage grates of Mt. Akina. You don’t have shit on me, because I am one of a ragtag few that call ourselves bus drifters.</p><p>We don’t advertise what it is we do: our bosses would be mad, both chain-of-command and union. Goodyear especially would be pissed. Within the tire giant is an elite unit of their marketing department. This bundle of assholes is much larger than our own group of bus fun-havers: it is dedicated to perpetuating the myth that the Metro Miler is the ultimate tire for all circumstances and must never be replaced for, say, winter conditions, or because hooking a drifting angle of greater than a few degrees feathers the inner lip of the carcass so thoroughly that they will show belts that night when the bus is racked.</p><p>How we do it is simple: once the last customer is safely off the bus, we head to the steep hill outside the old cemetery and countersteer into the twisties until the tires wail. The bus is so long that you have to do it entirely by sound: if you spent all your time looking in the rear-view mirror to see when the rear axle finally bounces free of its hated grip, you’d end up crashing, or at least going slow. We laugh at the rookies who flimsily understeer their New Flyers instead of kicking off a nice little feint slide.</p><p>There’s nothing like that pure moment when you’re fully sideways and that Cummins six is throbbing its brains out, shaking the bus to death in its 1900-rpm fuel cut rage, and knowing that any false move could be your last. No airbags, you see.</p><p>One of us, friendly old Hubert, is a master of the trail-brake drift. Once, I saw him put vise grips on a rear brake line before hitting the cemetery route. He noticed me there, and put one finger to his lips, letting me know that it was our little secret. And it was, even when that bus left the road the next morning and rammed through a daycare, the vise grip still clamped. I guess he forgot to take it off before passing it to the next driver.</p><p>There is only one big obstacle to our merry night’s fun: the bus <i>grip</i> drivers. They think that we don’t notice them going wheel-to-wheel out at the old dirt track. Their bosses don’t care when a nice new Nova LFS shows up with scars down the side that oddly look a lot like the livery of the neighbouring city’s public transit. Why would they care? It is too easy to look the other way, especially when you have been bribing drivers to throw a race once in awhile in order to get fat payouts from the bookie game.</p>

<p>“I know what I got,” taunted the Kijiji ad. My fingers reflexively clenched, digging fingernails into the flesh of my palms so hard they began to bleed. It was one of <i>those</i> ads, which made sense that they were asking $3500 for a Dodge Neon. This was the breaking point. I decided to make a visit in person.</p><p>“Hello, I am a collector of Dodge Neons,” I began the email, which was not exactly false, or false in any way, “and I would like to attend a showing of your automobile for possible inclusion in my collection.” After a quick response, the usual suspects had all bundled into Shaky Tim’s paint-shaker of a Fargo Power Wagon and were happily, if uncomfortably, burbling their way down the highway in search of noble gas joy.<br/></p><p>When we arrived there, we were shocked to see the most immaculate 1996 Dodge Neon in the history of humanity. His records were meticulous, going over every inch of detail on the blueprinted freshly-rebuilt 132hp two-liter under the hood, the obsessive respray in Strawberry Metallic red, and the hundreds of hours spent by the bodyshop fettling with every gravity-sagged panel gap and boot-scuffed interior panel. It was, for all intents and purposes, the best-condition car around. Who would spend this much effort restoring a <i>Neon</i>, I asked my compatriots.</p><p>They all agreed - there was no way we could buy it. It was simply too nice, and we would just roll it into a cornfield while offroading, or nuke the engine after engineering a grocery-store nitrous setup out of a flat of Whip-Its. The man who restored it - no, the man who <i>elevated</i> it - would be destroyed by our careless disregard for the product of his obsession. Yet we had to know more, and soon we were in the foyer of the man’s home, the group’s questions all being shouted at once, mixing into a blur of confusion and growing panic.</p><p>“It’s quite simple,” the old man said, and opened a door behind him, leading to the basement of the home. “Would you like to see the workshop?”</p><p>We had barely made it down the stairs when the door shut behind us, trapping us within the workshop. There, alongside the other victims, we would be forced to restore Chrysler economy cars for the rest of our days. It wasn’t so bad, really. It was nice to get to really spend the time making a car absolutely perfect instead of forcing myself to make it “good enough” in order to go to work.</p><p>I was particularly proud of the Caliber SRT4 I restored. There was nothing on the original blueprints that was not cleaned up to supra-dealership standards. We would spend our nights reading the factory service manual cover-to-cover with a flashlight, the only source of entertainment for the group. I knew that damn car stem to stern. You could say I knew what I got.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, German performance cars used to be cheap. They were stripped-out, sturdily-built, twitchy-handling sports car nightmares made primarily to excite the engineers who built them. Then, the world went to shit, and as their profits and the factories collapsed down around them, they just figured it might be a little easier to sell a few units if they bolted a 200lb leather seat to it and added a good thirty grand to the pricetag.</p><p>Thing was, I still wanted the stripped-out performance models of long ago. Yet, due to the inconvenience of being born too late in the span of human history, these vehicles were forever inaccessible to me, kept in climate-controlled inflatable bubbles in the dungeons of ultra-bougie richmos. The only solution? Build a time machine.</p><p>Sure, if you listen to physicists, engineers, and other pessimists, you know that it is impossible to build a time machine. Those people also told me it was a really bad idea to daily-drive a Dodge Shadow running nitromethane, and I’m still here, even though you do sometimes have to repeat what you’re saying to me twice into my good ear.</p><p>At last, I had arrived in 1979. Before me sat Porsches of every available trim level, with horsepower ranging from anemic to merely pathetic. It was beautiful; enough to bring a tear to my eye. I immediately purchased one of the 911s, being careful not to give the dealership flacks any bills made after the 1970s, and headed back to the time machine.</p><p>Just as I was about to step into the time machine, something caught my eye. At the other end of the street came a happily burbling, mint-condition 240Z, of an age so young that it had not yet begun to rust. I didn’t have enough vintage cashola left in my wallet for two cars. It was an impossible decision, a six-cylinder Sophie’s Choice. One trade later, I was returning to my current time period with a Datsun.</p><p>I know what you are asking: to have gone to all the effort of developing a time machine, just to travel back in time and buy the wrong car, was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was. That said, I wish I had spent the extra effort to design a time machine that could skip <i>ahead</i> a few months from when I took off, because there wasn’t much left of the 240Z by the time I had gotten it into my garage that February.</p>

<p>That tears it. I had finally reached my breaking point with the God-forsaken frozen-over hellhole in which I resided, and the endless dumps of lake-effect snow to which the foul winds had subjected me. This conclusion was only arrived at when I went to lift about six feet of snow off my driveway, and was rewarded with the poverty-spec plastic of the snow shovel shattering into a million pieces. Something had to be done, and I sure as hell didn’t see anyone else doing anything about it.</p><p>To uninitiated folks like the bylaw officer who tagged me with a summons, it would look like I had spent the last two weeks refusing to shovel my driveway. There is some degree of truth to this accusation, for in fact I had been walled up in the bomb-shelter I call a workshop, banging together the Final Solution to sidewalk shovelling. It was simply unacceptable that in this day and age, where we can launch our unwanted used cars into the Kepler belt, a man still had to shovel nature’s icy vomit off his own concrete.</p><p>What did you do, I hear you ask. Artificial intelligence? Genetically-engineered snow-eating raccoons? A precision flamethrower? No, nothing as crude as that. I built a snowblower with a 454 under the hood. Or at least it would be if it still had a hood: I’m not going to lie to you, there were some regrettable accidents along the way.</p><p>As I downshifted the Gear Vendors into low-range, I could hear applause from my fellow neighbours. Only one test flight needed to be taken, and they were already overjoyed that human ingenuity had overcome man’s greatest foe. Think of it: a world with perfectly cleared sidewalks, every time. You just had to keep countersteering every time the spinner brushes bit in on a chunk of fencepost or fire hydrant, because otherwise it popped one hell of a donut as the suspension unloaded. The twitchy handling was definitely making it hard to make an Instagram post while driving it.</p><p>My timing was perfect: at the top of the hill, coming out of the low sun hanging in the frozen sky, came the very same bylaw officer who had written me the initial summons. I kindled when I realized that he was likely here to verify whether or not I had successfully cleared the aforementioned snow, and would be my first legal witness to the majesty of my creation. In my excitement, and without thinking, I downshifted the main gearbox into the beastlike torque of First Gear, with a perfectly-executed if slightly flashy heel-toe downshift.</p><p>At that very moment, I realized I had neglected to account for the shock loading of the drivetrain. In my mind’s eye, I saw what had happened even as my agonizingly slow reflexes pushed in the clutch pedal again. Within nanoseconds, the blowing auger sheared clean off the PTO shaft and was propelled into the windshield of the bylaw officer’s Impala.</p><p>Still, though, the initial experiment was a success, and when the <i>real</i> cops arrived they had nothing but nice things to say about it. They were no tourists to the concept of abusing power, you see, and it <i>did</i> handle better than a Ford Explorer.</p>

<p>Tonight on <i>Dateline</i>: self-driving cars. America is going batshit nuts for them in a fucked-up way. Can we trust them? Where did they come from? We asked a nerd. That’s tonight, on <i>Dateline</i>.</p><p>Ted Perennial-Graduate-Student, can you describe for us the motivations of a self-driving car? Do they obey the Three Laws of Asimov’s robots, or are these heartless steel machines only capable of understanding the brutal dog-eat-dog jungle law of our Christian motoring standards?</p><p>I don’t understand all that techno-wizard spreadsheet geek talk, Ted. What I want to know is really simple: when I push the “Cruise Control” button in my 1989 Toyota Camry, is it going to run over a small child and explode their brains into my cupholder by way of the leaky heater core? It <i>might</i>? That doesn’t sound like technological advancement at all, which is maybe why this small town of coal miners in Under-Virginia no longer believe in the existence of objective truth.</p><p>We wanted to get down to the nitty-gritty, instead of believing what the big corporations and untrustworthy government scientists like Ted wanted us to think. That’s why we strapped 200 kilograms of thermite to the front bumper beam of this Audi A6 and drove it directly into a wall. As you can see, the resulting explosion is very worrying for parents of any small child. I’m Mike AmbushReporter for <i>Dateline</i>, signing off.</p>

<p>There are things that you just don’t argue about. No matter how tiresome of a Well-Actually you are, when you are confronted with such an obvious fact, it is impossible even to play the Devil’s advocate. The sky is blue, water is wet, grass is green, and the Jaguar E-Type is a beautiful car. Even blind people know that.</p><p>Recently, however, I was in the company of a man so driven by the religion of radical contrarianism that he dared utter an opinion about the E-Type. It wasn’t that good looking, he said. It was too low, with a hood too long, and wheels that were too tiny, I overheard.</p><p>All the proportions were wrong, he continued to criticize, as I noticed everyone else in the room perking up and staring, confused, in his direction. My travelling companion immediately departed to find a payphone to call for medical assistance, which at the time I thought was because this man was obviously mentally ill to be saying such things.</p><p>One of the onlookers, however, burst with an inhuman speed towards the aggressor, as if to sacrifice his own body to protect the assembled clients of the eatery from the heresies that were emitted like machine-gun fire from a mass murderer. That was what this man was, I came to realize. He had broken the social contract, fractured the thin band of trust between his fellow men so badly that there was now not even the smallest glint of compassion left for him in the room.</p><p>That’s when the lead pipes came out.</p><p>“I meant the 2+2,” is what I think he said for his last words. It was hard to tell through the shattered jawbone that swung freely from the bottom of what was left of his skull.<br/></p><p>The cops came, as they often do, minutes too late to save him. They stood over the bloody pulp, preparing to arrest all of us for some kind of mass delusion, a they-were-all-in-on-it Sherlock Holmes bullshit case that would take forever to prove. That was before we told the cops what the terrorist had said.</p><p>You know the rest about what happened afterward from the real-crime television shows on the metanet, but in reality I did quickly tire of the constant victory parades and the commencement speeches. The Mayor told me later that it was the first time they had ever handed out thirty-six keys to the city in one visit, but that he was happy to be giving them to real heroes instead of lame-os like astronauts and firefighters.</p>

<p>When television commands me to do something, it is hard to resist. I think this is why so many of my fellow Westerners grab ahold of a revolver and drive to the news studio, hoping to shut up the voice in their head. So, when the food channel started snootily bellowing a show title that sounded an awful lot like an order, it didn’t take much to put me out the door, into the Volare, and on the road to beat the one they called Bobby Flay.</p><p>He was some kind of a chef, an artist who could make a scotch egg from scratch just as easily as I could re-heat a microwave TV dinner. If you disrupted his win record, made something so good that even he himself had to admit that he had been bested, you would receive a handsome reward. So handsome, in fact, that I soon realized I was not the only one champing at the bit to compete with Lord Flay in his fried chicken puzzle palace.</p><p>Some Eastern European hellhole, yearning for enough American dollars to stuff a post-Soviet, post-war hole in the economy, had sent the best special-forces chefs they had in the military. I could maybe make a grilled cheese. It seemed obvious, therefore, that the fastest path to facing off against Flay and shutting up the shrieking commands of the television filling my frontal lobe was to cheat.</p><p>Luckily for me, I never went anywhere without my trusty one-shot of Rotella T6 synthetic motor oil. It wasn’t exactly what I would call a “cooking oil,” but after I poured a little into the hot wok of a Russkie who was looking the other way, the judges didn’t seem to have a lot of time to debate nomenclature in between trips to the lavatory. I was, therefore, the winner.</p><p>Soon, Flay himself descended from the heavens in which he had once sat in judgment of my cooking abilities. My grilled cheese was pretty good, he said, even though the challenge was to make a cabbage roll. And now, he boomed for the cameras, I would be dismantled by my televised foe for the crime of approaching him in his theatre of pain.</p><p>We had barely begun the actual competition when Flay motioned to turn off the cameras and stop the clock. He walked over to me, wiping his hands on his apron before sticking one out in a handshake of friendship.</p><p>“Look, I get paid either way,” began Flay, “but my car keeps throwing a check engine light, and if you fix it I’ll throw the match.”</p><p>It was just as well. Rotella T6 is really too expensive to use as cooking oil, and either way I had basically run out of it. I am sure that the trained palates of the judges would have been able to pick up on the subtle almond aroma of Subaru coolant conditioner, at which point the game would have been over for me anyway. I accepted Flay’s offer, and followed him out into the parking lot, where I reset the oil minder light on his daily-driver 2001 Honda Civic.</p><p>The next week, I received a postcard in the mail. It was the producer of Bobby’s show, inviting me to spend a segment on Guy Fiero’s. At least I think that’s what the name was. He was hard to look at directly.</p>

<p>Sure, the CIA manual said that they would train their agents to resist any form of torture, but I always had what it took to break them. Most of these guys had less “training” than your average barbershop quartet, and it was becoming apparent to my boss that I was no longer trying as hard as I once did. Seeing as it was performance review season, and that I worked for one of the world’s most notorious super-villains, I figured I might as well freshen things up around the shop.</p><p>So. First things first. Ideas. Gotta come up with something devilish that sounds easy on paper, maybe. Demean them, degrade their ego long before any of the physical torture starts. Maybe they’d even do it to themselves if you left them alone with it long enough, out of boredom and curiosity. Yeah, that’s the ticket.</p><p>It’s absolutely got to give them an idea of false success, some progress towards a goal they realize at last, to their despair, is completely unachievable. Maybe they could even make a mistake in their hubris, compound the problem so badly that a whole <i>new</i> level of torture begins, one they again inflict upon themselves.</p><p>Eh, it’s getting pretty close to the end of the day, and I want to go home. How about we make them just replace a lower ball joint on a Subaru?</p><p>The resulting parade in my honour when my boss’ boss’ boss takes control of the United Nations is something else. I just wish some of those CIA guys had actually finished getting the pinch bolts off, because my car steers kind of dicky on the highway and I’d really like to get it fixed.</p>

<p>Talk to your doctor if you have a shortage of excitement in your drive. Corners™ may help. Available in off-camber, off-camber decreasing radius, and off-camber uneven decreasing radius varieties, Corners™ is the cure for the common commute.</p><p>If you experience a loss of grip, powerslide backwards into roadside fencing, or damage suspension components, immediately discontinue use of Corners™ and contact your doctor or an alignment professional. Patients receiving Corners™ should not attempt ordinary conversation with regular human beings, because common dosages of SUVs are contraindicated for Corners™.</p><p>After your treatment with Corners™ is stopped, your risk of boredom with straight-line commuting increases. Your risk for getting tired of sitting in stop and go traffic is increased if you have already become infuriated at slow-moving crossovers in front of you. Do not stop taking Corners™ without first speaking with your doctor.</p><p>Corners™ is not to be replaced with the generic medication Highway On-Ramps or similar. They are clogged with slow-moving BMWs anyway who can’t pick a line.</p>

<p>Spring has sprung. This I know, because nothing marks the advent of Mother Nature’s renewal from beneath the death-blanket of snow like the annual Tiny Hondas meeting at the old YMCA. And nothing marks the Tiny Hondas meeting like the annual drag-out fist fight between Postie Tim and Dirty Doug about whether the CT110 is better than the CT90 or vice versa.</p><p>Sure, for a few years this wasn’t even the headliner. Back in the late 90s, when the Civic was being used by every Tom, Dick and Vincent to rob eighteen-wheelers filled with TV/VCR combos and DVD players, there were a lot more disagreements, generally about whether or not anyone actually enjoyed the tuna sandwiches offered by the concession stand. With the descent of Honda’s star, though, we now found ourselves in a world where two middle-aged dudes kicking the shit out of each other over whose minibikes were better was the height of brand-partisan entertainment in my city.</p><p>This time, however, something was different. Perhaps it was because both of them were getting up there in age, a little slower, a lot less durable than a decade ago when the feud began. Maybe it was that they were slowly becoming feral, driven to extreme behaviour by the dwindling supply of parts for each of their favoured auto-clutching toy motorbikes. No matter what it was, the two gladiators soon found themselves drained of energy, and collapsed onto each other in a heaving mass, voided of breath.</p><p>Doug and Tim had reached an uneasy truce, it seemed. Perhaps this spring would be different, full of renewal, and not just because while they were distracted I was finally able to get a CT70 exhaust for less than two hundred fucking dollars.</p>

<p>It all started when I was stuck in traffic downtown, drumming my fingers along with the sound of header gasket leaks and smelling the sweet tang of hot coolant pooling in the front K-frame. Not even half a shoulder check had gone by when I noticed the meter maid, in her three-wheeled Cushman nightmare, coughing an agricultural double-thumper boxer note into low-hanging clouds of oil smoke, shooting past me on her way to throw some tickets under windshield wipers.<br/></p><p>When I say “meter maid,” I don’t mean to imply any kind of actual official-ness to her role. Her gang was one of the most dangerous ones in the city, forming shortly after autonomous parking-enforcement drones became good enough to replace a well-paying union job. With all the leftover meter maid bikes going to city auction, it should have seemed obvious that a biker gang would soon form to consume the excess inventory. Hence the shoulder check: if they didn’t like you, the Meter Maids had all kinds of ways to get back at you when your car was no longer in motion.</p><p>A couple years ago, a friend and I were visiting the auto show. Being cognizant of the rules of the street, we avoided the hand-tagged “no parking” signs on the curb directly across from the convention centre. Parking a few blocks away gave us a good excuse for our government-mandated 30 minutes a day of activity, and when we finally approached the convention centre we got to see first-hand just how deep and vicious the Maids could get with someone who parked on their turf.</p><p>The victim was a self-driving Volvo wagon, one of the models that drops you off at the door and then goes to auto-park until you need it again. I don’t know if the Swedes had ever visited our city, seen what happens to people who only use the “official” signs to park, but it wasn’t pretty.</p><p>A group of Maids had already succeeded in plasma-cutting the roof off of the Volvo, and now had it lashed to a collection of flame-spewing Cushman trikes, chariot-style. As we went inside, the trikes began to pull it out of the spot with a snap of the reins, a Maid dressed in military-surplus camo and wearing a crown of used pilot jets steering them.</p><p>Tough city, but it was definitely easier than waiting the whole day at the impound lot.</p>

<p>When I was just a small child, the small village that I lived in received a new inhabitant. It was amazing that anyone had wanted to come to our village, much less install themselves in the cobwebbed manse that Mrs. Carruthers had departed from this mortal plane within. Yet, here he was, and he had brought with him a car like nothing I had ever seen before.</p><p>Even at that tender young age, I could tell that this thing was different. Stark white, with a ride height like a light pickup truck, it clawed at the earth through its front wheels. None of the body panels seemed to line up correctly, and the exhaust note was a clattery racket emitted limply from a depressingly pitted straight-pipe muffler. My father told me that it had been built by “Communists,” and having no deeper understanding of the concept then, I believed him. Communists were simply very different people, and they had constructed a car that our simple farmyard way of life could not see accepting.</p><p>Finally, I could no longer contain my curiosity, and went with my school chums to visit the driveway in which the strange car laid. I found myself involuntarily holding my breath as I approached the Communist shitbox (my uncle’s words, agreeing with my father over a belt of weed-whacker deck solvent). What would I find? Was there greater truth out there, somewhere far within the prairie horizon that encircled everything I had ever known?</p><p>I will never forget that glorious afternoon I spent with the 1984 Chevrolet Cavalier Type 10 hatchback. Even today, it seems like a dream, because nobody else has ever seen one.</p><p>As for myself, I soon fled to the big city in search of my own hatchback shitbox dreams. That’s how I ended up going to prison for helping Volkswagen with a monkey-based gas-chamber, but that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” asked my usually-genteel postman, as he attempted to bare-hand lug a packing-tape-wrapped iron LQ4 V8 shortblock from his truck, all the way up my icy driveway. Experiencing this shook me a little bit, and I began to analyze the ways in which my constant demands on Rodney’s physique were perhaps a little unreasonable.<br/></p><p>I decided right then and there that I was going to strike a blow for worker’s rights everywhere. Using an old lawnmower and some scrap batteries, I built a prototype package-retrieval drone, which could meet Rodney at the curb. He would load it with parcels of up to a thousand pounds or so, and then wave as the happy robot drives it back to my garage, where some future, as-yet-undecided robot would cheerfully file it away for me, so I could lose freshly-ordered parts to the yawning maw of my dragonesque hoard with even greater efficiency.</p><p>The next morning, I was even more excited than usual to hear the sound of the Quad 4 of the LLV knocking its way up my street. It didn’t even really matter what I had ordered, I was so overjoyed to be making the world a better place through automation.</p><p>Now, no plan survives contact with the enemy, and in retrospect I probably should have A. tested and B. removed the razor-sharp blade from the mowing deck of the drone before sending it towards my postie friend. The good news is, I was very incentivized to shovel all the snow on my driveway because all that red was making the neighbours curious.</p>

<p>Your workplace may have unfortunate verbal tics, some kind of memetic virus spreading amongst the group. Perhaps it is an excess of profanity, threatening your professionalism. Maybe it’s someone who can’t stop making puns and Janet from Accounting is looking for hydraulic poison quick-injectors on eBay. In our case, it was that visitors kept making the same joke, and so we decided to just make some money off of a swear jar.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, working at NASA is great. You get all the leftover donuts you can steal out of budget meetings, working with brilliant people to squeeze a dime is a thrill ride without compare, and if you don’t fuck anything up, at the end of a few years you can take a big reduction-in-force buyout and go work for a defence contractor. Trust me: “rocket scientist” looks <i>great</i> on a resume. And that’s where the problem started.</p><p>I worked with this guy named Hector. Hector was a pretty carefree guy, but he had one problem: every single person who came to visit the office made an “it’s not rocket science” joke. When I say every single person, I mean it: we started an in/out tally one day and by the time we were running 247-0 Hector was screaming and holding his temples like a rat was trying to get out.</p><p>In his anger, we feared that he may rip apart and consume the coffee maker, which is something we absolutely did not want to have happen. You see, we had just figured out yesterday that we had been converting from imperial to metric wrong for the last 20 years, and now actually had some coffee in our coffee instead of throwing our empty mugs at the wall and letting them smash against it. Productivity was <i>up</i>.</p><p>So we just put out a swear jar. Whenever some visitor made the joke, Hector made them drop a quarter in the jar. He can be very persuasive, in the way that seeing a 350lb rocket scientist shaking with white-hot rage after cornering you in the breakroom is persuasive. At the end of the year, it turned out we had enough to put the JPL on its own swear-jar-based budget.</p><p>Now we send probes to Mars for kicks and test whatever the fuck we want. Sure, the President doesn’t like it, but it’s not his money. If he wants it to be, all he has to do is say four little magic words.</p>

<p>If you look in the encyclopedia under “bad idea,” you’ll see my steam-powered 1982 Ford Escort GT, but that’s only because it seems to have an insatiable hunger for old men sitting on park benches reading encyclopedias.</p><p>In terms of chassis dynamics, the understeer is not totally unexpected: not only is it a front-wheel-drive economy car, but it also had the better half of a steam locomotive grafted to it. Months of work as a part-time security guard at the train museum had gone into this project, smuggling the front end out piece by piece in my surprisingly roomy pockets while I dodged the ancient geezers who wanted to start every sentence with “Well, actually&hellip;”</p><p>Why did I do it? I was ready to stop paying so much money at the gas station, for one thing. With this puppy, all I have to do is keep the tender stuffed with coal, or wood, or whatever squirrels and rabbits I could catch in the park outside my house before the police started to take an interest in all those clutch-cable snares I was leaving around. Despite what the local hipster environmentalist websites had to say, it wasn’t really a thing about saving the planet, either. If it was, I would be using one of those newfangled electromotive engines to boil these tires, and probably also make those tires out of hemp or something, I don’t know.</p><p>The Escort was a fantastic daily driver, fast and comfortable. There was never a lack of heat, either, although air conditioning was one of those things that I kept putting off to the back of my project honey-do list. No, the real problem was trying to get it started whenever I ended up at a red light. You know how hard it is to keep your coworkers interested in carpooling when it involves them rapidly shovelling dead squirrels into a roaring-hot firebox?</p>

<H1>Swan Quake</H1>
<p>Ever since I’d moved to this neighbourhood, I found myself taking walks in the lakeside park nearby. About a block away from my place, the city’s hassles fell away to a soft drone, often overwhelmed in the summer by the sound of extremely horny cicadas. During my constitutional, I had developed a pattern of dropping in on the maintenance shed and seeing what Ilyich, the groundskeeper, had been working on.</p><p>A lot of people don’t realize just how many gas-powered engines are around them every day: every weed-whacker, lawn tractor, chainsaw and generator needed one, even in this day and age of rampant electrification driven by a Bond villain. Every single one of those teeny engines eventually needed repair, and that is how I came to meet Ilyich.<br/></p><p>It should come as no surprise by now that I had a lot of affection for the small utility engine, probably in much the same way as other human beings felt respect towards a trusted pack animal or particularly strong child. Ilyich seemed to always be repairing one or another, and so I would sit for awhile as the sun set, and hang out next to him at the workbench during his toil.</p><p>One evening, the wheels of fate left what I now know to be a trap in my path. Next to Ilyich’s shed sat a shattered fibreglass swan, and I recognized it as one of the paddlewheel-driven boats that the park rented out to young lovers in order to combine the twin anti-pleasures of bicycling and smelling the wafting odour of fish shit. After asking my groundskeeper companion about it, it was revealed that the geartrain sheared clear out of the boat. Olympic athletes were visiting and got into a race, Ilyich explained, and it would be cheaper just to replace the boat than try to fix it.</p><p>Have you ever carried a giant fibreglass swan to your house? If you had, you would understand the confused looks I was now getting from my neighbours. Their primitive brains could not understand, I knew, and it would be fruitless to explain. Already, a great idea was forming in my mind, and I was giddy with anticipation. It would free up so much room in my shed, I told myself.</p><p>The next day, I returned to the lake. No longer could I carry the swan: it was more than a little bit heavier now. As I pushed it off the utility trailer into the boat launch, Ilyich came up to me, confused. After the marine Detroit primed and fired, screaming its bone-chilling supercharger curses through a jury-rigged stovepipe exhaust, he was no longer confused, but just held his ears and nodded.</p><p>It felt good to be useful.</p>

<p>Living in the future was pretty great. We had jetpacks, personal robot butlers, bioengineered sex freaks, but something was still missing. I wanted to be able to download a car. Yes, yes, I’ve heard all the jokes - but with teleportation technology right on the cusp of becoming practical for the average upper-middle-class neo-suburbanite, it felt like something that we should be able to do by now.</p><p>That’s why I visited the laboratory of Exegis Research, a subsidiary of the Benevolent Yoshinaka Corporation. You might recognize them as the guys and gals who 3D-printed an entire continent for an Ikea marketing campaign: Smålund. I hear the smell of fresh ABS filament has just about worn off by now, too. Exegis’ chief research scientist, whose name is, by contract, an unprintable series of Meta-Unicode characters, was more than happy to show me around the car-downloading prototype.</p><p>With just a few button presses, we were able to sign onto an exclusive private tracker and torrent a vintage Mazda Porter. The small size of the vehicle was key for fast download speeds, I was told by almost everyone I met. The fast connection of the Exegis labs hungrily gulped down the data, and soon the massive Realizer strapped to their warehouse ceiling was up and running, rapidly generating my free car.</p><p>I was excited to try it - just think, a car downloaded from the Internet. How could that not be the ultimate expression of cheap-ass automobile ownership? Panting with anticipation, I turned the key and watched the gauges spring to life. It was impossible, however, to miss the booming Eastern European techno music playing at maximum volume on the stereo. Turning the dial did nothing, and when I looked at the head unit I soon found out why: on the LCD was a series of bouncing letters and dancing horizontal lines.</p><p>“MAZDA PORTER CRACKED BY SOICHIRO OF PHROZEN CREW,” shrieked the sinusoidal stream of polished-chrome letters. It appeared that my free Mazda Porter had in fact been pirated by one of those oh-so-opportunistic warez groups, so quick on the uptake that they struck only nanoseconds after the technology to reproduce a car was invented in this very lab.</p><p>It wasn’t all bad, though: I was starting to get used to the joyous techno beat, and I also saw the words “PRESS F1 - INFINITE GAS” appear in the corner after the list of greetz.</p>

<p>I’ve always been kind of a putterer. You can’t leave me alone for very long without coming back to find me trying to fix everything in the vicinity. Last week, I had to wait for an appointment at the doctor’s office and ended up repairing the dust-covered IBM Selectric under the secretary’s desk before he got me in. That thing went like greased lightning afterward, which is also how my doctor described the quality of my digestive tract. What can I say? Eating ain’t fixing.</p><p>Now that we’ve dispensed with the poop joke, I can tell you about a time that I was not able to fix something, and that it haunted me for the rest of my days. That something was an innocent little Honda generator, abandoned in the corner of an industrial auction to the point where even the auctioneer seemed to forget all about it.</p><p>The little generator looked sad with its dinged case and mottled paint, and I felt that I should take it home and try my best to bring it back to life. Soichiro would want it that way, I told myself as I drove home carefully with it safely buckled into the passenger seat next to me. It just didn’t make sense to me that someone would throw away a device that was so precious, and resolved to tear it down immediately.</p><p>A few weeks later, I finally got around to taking it apart. In my defence, Netflix was really good that month, and by “really good” I mean I figured out how to work the search engine to get past all those documentaries about beheadings. Nothing seemed particularly broken in the little Honda, so I kept disassembling and cleaning as I went, humming a happy song of puttering joy.</p><p>When I got down to the bare crankshaft without seeing a single flaw, the calm that usually flowed through my body was suddenly replaced with anger. How dare it refuse me, I bellowed at my shocked cat. In a rage, I poured half of eBay into the postal system and set about replacing every single part within reach, reasoning that one of them must be bad in a way that I couldn’t see.</p><p>At last, I had run out of parts to reassemble. I pushed the electric starter, again and again, only to be rewarded with the sound of the starter spinning and not kicking the generator over. There was no Earthly explanation for this, I told myself, and soon I began walking the streets at night, screaming at passersby as my mental state dissolved into a mist of rage. Soon, I was interred at a mental hospital, and my assets liquidated to re-pay the government for their noble sacrifice.</p><p>“Oh, hey, I picked up your old Honda generator at auction,” said my favourite orderly, who I had become close to due to his own love of all things mechanical.<br/></p><p>“Yeah, all it needed was some gas.”<br/></p>

<p>When every minute counts, it’s not like you can slow down for every Tom, Dick and playground zone on your commute. That’s why I support Proposition X - a law that will force a high-speed “access lane” for people who are in a real God damned hurry. The move has unprecedented bipartisan approval, and may in fact represent the first time in Western history that everyone agrees it is a pretty dope thing to do.</p><p>We will coat this dedicated access lane in high-grip VHT traction compound, which vastly improves the cornering speeds possible even on conventional all-season street tires. Access to the lane will be gated by motorsports competition licenses, unless needed in a drastic emergency.</p><p>Proposition X will improve the lives of everyone - suddenly, ambulance drivers will be able to drive flat-out on highways, and fire fighters and other first responders can open up their engines and provide life-saving help much faster. I myself am not a first responder, or a second responder, or in fact any kind of responder that shows up before 10:30 in the morning, but I know that Proposition X will help me improve my business and help me make coffee dates with prospective clients much faster.</p><p>It’s not just good for <i>my</i> business, either - fuel sales will go up, raising the price of oil and saving the moribund resource-bound economies of besieged regions. For this reason, and for many others, local business leaders have thrown their weight behind the upcoming Proposition.</p><p>It is for these reasons that - hold on, I’ve just been informed that the bicycle lane mafia wants a rider on Proposition X. They’re demanding a tax break for carbon fibre bodywork. I think we can come to some agreement on this issue.</p>

<p>Immigration brings in some of our finest minds, most generous people and most momentous innovations. Without immigrants, our lives would be much worse and our country weaker. Then again, there are also my neighbours.</p><p>I don’t know what country they come from, but it’s obviously some kind of dystopian hellhole where no dissent or creativity is allowed. They toil endlessly to be the same as everyone else, to achieve what their society views as “perfection.” Why do I think these things about them? Just look at their cars: a Toyota Camry and a Lexus RX350.</p><p>Every morning, when they open the front door to leave for work, I glare through the boarded-up slats of my Unabomber shack and take notes. Perhaps <i>today</i> will be the day when they let things slip, I reason. Sure, they’ll leave with the RX350, but then they’ll come back in a rust-holed four-eyed Fox body, like the rest of my neighbours. Hell, I’d even tolerate a straight-piped first-gen Acura Integra at this point.</p><p>No. Every night, they return, greeting my glare with the xenon headlights of the Lexus or the Camry, parking comfortably in their non-oil-stained driveway, and heading inside to spend time with their family. Don’t they understand that they just don’t fit in around here?</p><p>Some nights it makes me so sick that I walk down the street to see if my neighbour Hazem has finished his manual-swapped, nitromethane-gulping Buick Reatta drag car. He never will, and that’s exactly the attitude to have around here. That’s why he and I belong, and they don’t.</p>

<p>When you’re in Chevy LUV, the whole world just seems brighter. That long-throw shift lever, the buzzy four-banger, the comforting rattle of the rear sliding window, it all added up to an unparalleled automotive experience. The fact that this was a drive to the Home Depot to pick up parts for my shitter didn’t take anything away from the experience.</p><p>Thing is, any anthropologist will tell you that Home Depot is where the biggest, baddest trucks congregate to on weekends, so that the production accountants who own them can load up on garden gnomes and plastic yard organizers. Those trucks take up a lot of room, and after the third consecutive lap of the parking lot I still could not find anywhere that my little Chevy would fit.</p><p>I was about to leave when I caught sight of the rental forklifts that the Depot had on offer for the spring season. They seemed quite big, and in fact, so big that my little Isuzu-Chevy bastard could probably pass for one. You could hear the grinding of gears inside my head from the sidewalk, as I inexpertly double-clutch downshifted an idea.</p><p>Nobody inside the Home Depot seemed to notice. Employees didn’t care, and the “real truck guys” who were checking out the programmable-lightbulbs and bidet aisles wouldn’t notice a weird-looking forklift in the lumber aisle. All it took was a few well-placed horn honks to scare the pedestrians away, and I had the run of the place.</p><p>All good things must come to an end, however. I was about to pull into the checkout line when I heard a gentle rapping on my passenger window. Leaning over, I rolled down the window and came face to face with an Occupational Health &amp; Safety inspector, making sure that the worker-drones at Home Depot were doing things by the book. He was displeased that I was wearing neither a hard hat nor a high-visibility safety vest, and refused to believe that I did not work at the Home Depot. I was trapped, but then I had another great idea.</p><p>“Look, I can prove to you that I don’t work at Home Depot,” I said, reaching into my glovebox and thrusting the evidence upon him. “Look: fine-thread <i>metric bolts</i>.”<br/></p>

<p>A lot of today’s youths are turning to living in their cars, and I for one can’t fault them. With the insane over-valuation of real estate, the ever-growing cost of utilities, and the fact that today’s modern car is both more comfortable and reliable than a house, who would ever want to live in something that doesn’t have wheels? And yet, this leads us down the golden path of risk: there is something more out there, something even more destructive to your income than property ownership.</p><p>That something is <i>motorsports</i>.</p><p>For the last few years, I’ve made the acquaintance of Shaky Tim, a drifter (in both senses of the word) who lives out of his 240SX. Occasionally, he’ll pull into my driveway and stay the night, using my shower in exchange for leaving behind some rare parts he doesn’t need anymore. It is in this way that our relationship progressed, until one fateful morning.</p><p>“Hey man,” asked Tim, “you ever thought about selling your house, buying a motorhome, putting nitrous on that motorhome and then doing quarter-mile pulls for pinks in your <i>house</i>?”<br/></p><p>I hadn’t.</p><p>Two hours later, I was registering my house at the DMV. Sure, the parking wasn’t very good - I was going to have to mostly ride mopeds from now on, which wasn’t <i>that</i> big of a downside - but I was free to go wherever I wanted to, albeit at the cost of approximately one former mortgage payment per kilometre in fuel.</p><p>The real problem came when I showed up at the drag strip. For whatever reason, it couldn’t pass tech. I assume the reason is because of a long-seated hatred of home ownership by the moneyed classes, which is why I am here today demanding that Parliament act quickly to finance a series of motorhome drag racing series to protect homeowners’ investments.</p>

<H1>Side Hustles to Make Fast Cash</H1>
<p>A lot of you have very expensive addictions: bad cars, mediocre cars, photography of cars, sometimes even <i>motorcycle ownership</i>. It is for this reason that any truly addicted car gal or guy worth their salt should pick up a little side hustle. With only a small percentage of the ingenuity you exercise every day when trying to explain to a police officer why you just ripped a donut in an occupied playground zone, you can make some money to offset the crushing fiscal apocalypse you have brought upon yourself via the curse of limited impulse control.</p><p>Nowadays, many old people melt down old electronics and cabling for the gold conductors buried within. This takes a lot of time, and it’s never really a sure thing. For much less effort, you need only hang out at a liquor store near a college. Convince the co-eds to buy a few bottles of Goldschlager, and then wait outside the sewer line to their sorority the next morning with a sifting pan.</p><p>I’ve been a Nissan product designer for the last five years, and nobody has asked to check my company ID yet. The pay isn’t great, because I’m not actually “on the payroll,” but if you stick around after presentations there’s some stale sandwiches and muffins that otherwise just get thrown away.</p><p>Most everyone will give you a few bucks if you ring their doorbell and pretend to be collecting money for a charity for crippled children. It helps if you also cripple a child beforehand, just in case the mark has no imagination.</p><p>Did you know the government has no restrictions whatsoever on who can and cannot operate a casino? It’s not true, but if you can shut the place down before the Feds investigate, people will trade you real legal tender for fake plastic coins that you can pick up at any dollar store.</p><p>Most municipal signs are held together with high-quality stainless steel fasteners, and it’s not like they need <i>all</i> of them. With a traffic sign on every block, you can turn “stop” into “cash!”</p>

<p>The first couple weeks after the holidays are always a big-time bummer for me. Once-glimmering roads are now caked in ugly smog-choked slush, there’s no specials to look forward to on television, and schoolchildren are no longer buoyed by the spirit of the season to listen to a passerby’s 30-minute explanation of how he invented the instant noodle. Sometimes, I think the only thing that keeps me going is the Fifty Percent Off Boxing Day sale at the you-pull-it junkyard.</p><p>Your average human being doesn’t want to be out in this kind of weather, much less bonking their frozen knuckles on a frosted-steel rad support when trying to remove a stuck fastener. It is for this reason that I believe I have a pretty good chance of scoring a minty Toyota shortblock for only a hundo. You see, years ago, Toyota built this car in Japan. Once, it was the pride of a man’s driveway, the vehicle he identified himself as to prospective clients and lovers. Something happened to it along the way, and the engine was stripped for some teenager’s hot rod project. I could still feel its spirit, however, begging me to get it working again, to resurrect it from its horrible undeath in my back forty, devoid of motive power.</p><p>The yard is empty, a frozen tundra of nothingness below a dead winter sky. I have to brush an inch of ashy smog-snow off the dead cars as I pass them in the rows, the heaped ice making it impossible to determine what they once were otherwise. Several times, I think I have spotted the unmistakable angles of a Mk2 Supra, but they turn out to be lesser beasts: the closest I get is a 1987 Celica with rotten orange waves of damage radiating from its rear right quarter panel like it lost a fight with an elephant. Eventually, I reach something that I know to be a Supra, its edgy mesh grille and pop-up headlights unmistakeable. I laugh at myself for my previous inability to tell: it is so obvious now.</p><p>It is remarkable that you can pay so little in order to get such an education about the end products of industrial society, I think as I try to split loose the retention prong of a recalcitrant electrical connector. A lesser man would simply cut these, I tell myself in order to calm the growing frustration I am feeling at this task. Someone like the dreaded Previous Owner of my own Toyota, who clearly never met a wire cutter he didn’t like.</p><p>Eventually, through my efforts, the engine is released from its prison. I take advantage of the courtesy gantry crane, its massive wheelbarrow tires unimpeded by the trifle of snow coating the yard, and escort the 7M all the way to the parking lot. </p><p>It is only then that I realize I am not as alone as I once thought. I hear the braying of trumpets, and into the parking lot rolls a garishly-decorated jitney cab powered by a wheezing Toyota 22R. There is nowhere for me to run. The Toyota Owner’s Club demands tribute.</p>

<p>It’s unfair that the government would step in and restrict free trade, especially with all of those friendly Iranian dudes who were willing to trade me white-labeled Persian Renault knockoffs in exchange for worthless nuclear secrets. Wasn’t like you couldn’t find that shit on the internet anyway, I told the CIA operatives who came in surprisingly well-kept 1970s Land Cruisers to interrogate me.</p><p>An interrogation is a two-way street, I complained to them. It was just simply unfair: they could cram bamboo shoots under my fingernails, but they didn’t want to cut a deal for some of their un-needed spare parts. You could fund the government for years just by selling off some primo doors and roofs, I argued, but they didn’t care. Simply wasteful.</p><p>After a few hours more of abuse, the CIA goons decided that I was not worth the effort, and departed in a huff. As they sped off, they scattered my parts-rat neighbours who had already begun disassembling their parked Land Cruisers. I lived in a really good neighbourhood, you see.</p><p>I rubbed my fingernails, drank a bit of coffee to overcome the sodium pentathol, and considered my options.</p><p>They didn’t tell me <i>not</i> to continue the deal, so I decided to phone up Vahid and see if he could cut me some kind of a discount, because clearly customs was going to be a real bugbear about the import duty on these Renaults.</p>

<H1>Art History 302</H1>
<p>Traditional paint on canvas often fixates on just a few genres: the still life, the grotesque, the erotic work. Today, students, you will be introduced to one of the finest genres of them all: the self-portrait of the artist, standing in the empty engine bay of a car from which he has just pulled the motor. Here are some notable works from the ages:</p><p><b>Rembrandt, 1664: <i>God Damn Accessory Drive Bullshit<br/></i></b></p><p>Due to the lack of automobiles at the time, Rembrandt paints himself posed in the empty chest cavity of a dead horse, its heart removed. It is unclear whether or not the resulting engine swap was successful. </p><p><b>Henri Matisse, 1921: <i>Fuck This Low Compression Piece of Cheese-Eating Shit</i></b></p><p>In this controversial work, the artist is portrayed standing in the engine bay of a period Renault, from which the wheezing two-cylinder has been at last removed. Broad brush strokes omit most of the detail in the mechanical pieces, but the clever observer can see that it is obvious that the compression rings are bad.</p><p>At the time, art critics in Nice refused to believe the engine was “all that blown” and offered to take it off his hands if Matisse were to throw it in with the painting, by far the most generous reception of any of his works during his short life.</p><p><b>Jean-Michel Basquiat, 1983: <i>Holy Shit Do I Ever Regret Buying This</i></b></p><p>It is a common misconception that the gifted Basquiat never owned a car. In point of fact, he had purchased this extremely sick (in only one sense of the word) 1977 Dodge Aspen off of a bandmate. In the work, you can see that, despite his limited experience in mechanical engineering, Jean-Michel has successfully pulled the dying e-carb piece of fucking trash out of the car and is preparing it for a small-block Chevy swap, a particularly daring piece of cross-brand work, especially for the time.</p><p>The swap later raised controversy in the local modified-car community, though it never successfully ran, with the car being crushed by New York City parking enforcement only a week later due to having parked on the wrong side of the road during an odd-numbered Tuesday.</p>

<p>A lot of scientific ink has been spilled over the phenomenon of the Capri Anomaly of late 2017, but settle in and let me tell you how it really happened. You see, sometimes when a man loves a bodykitted Mustang but doesn’t want to pay five freaking grand for one, he makes incredibly bad choices at the junkyard and creates a tachyon emitter out of a pair of old Dodge ECUs and a Saab 9-7X magnesium third member. Huh, I guess it didn’t take long to explain at all.</p><p>Once the Capri had appeared, of course, it meant that I had to get it registered. Now, you try waiting in line at the DMV all day, only to then have to explain to them the extradimensional origin of your car. Things are different over on that other plane. I finally just decided to mark down one of the ß symbols as an “8″ on the VIN form so they would give me a license plate and I could be on my way.</p><p>Although I hadn’t checked before the Summoning, it turns out that in the other dimension, they also have gasoline. I decided to put some high-octane, low-ethanol stuff in it just to be on the safe side, since who knows how the guy over there maintained it before I raptured it right out of his driveway into a dimensional fold. They might not have RockAuto.</p><p>The week and a half I spent with the Capri were some of my finest days on this Earth. A lot of people think the engine was sluggish, and the car didn’t do enough to differentiate itself from the other Fox-body products, and these things are true. Every time I looked at that swoopy rear quarter and the green tail lights, though, I just couldn’t help but smile. And that’s what owning a car is all about.</p><p>One morning, I came out to see a bunch of dudes in suits looking over my car. I yelled, and for my troubles was shoved to the ground and restrained by them. A black tow truck appeared, seized my Capri, and disappeared with it. The overzealous parking patrol in this city is <i>exactly</i> why I don’t pay my taxes.</p>

<p>The U-Haul desk jockey visibly blanches as I approach, stretching my hands in their fingerless driving gloves. I smile, presumably out of common human friendliness, but in actuality because I am proud of my ability to still break through to someone who has been conditioned so thoroughly to care about their minimum wage job. My Piloti driving shoes squeak on the hard-wearing industrial tile flooring of the depot.</p><p>“One of your finest pick-up trucks, Garçon,” I say, my lips exposing the canines in my grin.<br/></p><p>He knows what I am doing, but does not care. I am momentarily disappointed that I no longer need to continue the charade, this game of cat and mouse that I had built up in my mind. They’re not <i>his</i> trucks, I suppose, and maybe if I blow this one up in a particularly creative way, at least he won’t have a boring day at work when the wrecker drops off the shattered wreck, still dipping with glittery oil. With a dismissive wave of his hand, he tells me to go find my truck in the lot. A bulky Chevy key, an asset tag attached, sits proudly on the Formica countertop.</p><p>As I leave the parking lot, I decide to press my luck. A quick two-step spurs the V8 into reducing the rear tires to a cloud of acrid smoke, but I can see in the rear-view mirror that he does not even look up from the desk, absorbed now in what I assume is a mobile phone streaming hardcore pornography. Depressed, I merge gently into traffic, and drive responsibly all the way to the Home Depot. It is like they have taken all the <i>fun</i> out of abusing a rental car. I mope for the entire trip.</p><p>At the end of my shopping trip, I am stuck in the sole checkout line behind a pair of men. I am so consumed in my depression that I don’t even realize that they, too, are wearing Pilotis and fingerless driving gloves. It is only a few minutes later, that one of them starts complaining about ideal tire pressures, that I realize I am not alone in my doldrums. We are, all of us, victims of this man at the U-Haul desk who does not even give us the satisfaction at being outraged at our violation of the social contract.</p><p>A few weeks later, after what feels like dozens of meetings, we have arrived at a solution to our problem. We will freak out the normals by properly parking our pickup trucks, inside the lines, straight, and only taking one stall. At our first meet, I can already hear angry civilians shrieking at how unnatural the sight of properly parked pickups is.</p>

<p>As a man of industry, how do you feel about the way the aerospace-inspired cabin of the new-for-1993 Chrysler Concorde envelops your body, lending your spirit a greater sense of purpose on this Earth?</p><p>Well, I’m wondering why the Panasonic car phone that was in the brochures isn’t available in this car. Did you guys in Auburn Hills pull a fast one on us again?</p><p>Sir, this is a used car lot, and this is a 25-year-old Chrysler product. You’re lucky there isn’t a baseball glove filled with used condoms and mustard packets instead of a steering wheel. May I provide you with a complimentary shaming of your socioeconomic status while you wait for my manager to approve a test drive?</p><p>Please.</p><p>Very well, sir. Your credit score, as calculated by the metaminds of every major financial institution ever invented by man, whether accidentally or intentionally, is so low as to render you almost a new kind of life on this Earth altogether. There are giant squids in the aquarium, sir, who are a better credit risk than you. It is for this reason that our own financing arm, the principals of which, I will caution you, have all gone to white-collar prison for massive, ongoing criminal fraud, refuse to finance you at anything other than a frankly eye-watering thirty-seven per cent, compounded daily. Your great-grandchildren will be paying off the loan on this nearly three decade old front-wheel-drive luxury car, of which the automatic transmission fluid no doubt currently resembles the vomit of a three year old child who was recently introduced to the concept of orange soda and scrambled eggs and then allowed to go nuts on a Hardee’s breakfast menu.</p><p>Can you get the monthly payment down to something I can afford, though?</p>

<p>Remember that you have <b>RIGHTS</b>. No rental car desk clerk can make you feel inadequate for rejecting the so-called “upgrade.” You rented the small subcompact for a reason, and that was so you could fully disable the traction control and blitz a highway on-ramp with the handbrake with little or no risk of impending death.</p><p>Sure, your other coworkers going to the conference all rented big-titty V8s, but they have fatty SUV frames and shitty ride-comfort suspension to contend with. Theirs is a more simple-minded straightline speed, nothing at all like the urges you have to feel the limits of the grip that the hard-wearing Ling-Long Economaster factory tires can provide.</p><p>No, when the rental agency tells you that they plumb sold out of the little Yaris you had your heart set on, you need to make sure that in no uncertain terms they understand that you intended to thrash the living shit out of that car and return to them a worn-out husk, smoking from both ends and with the interior smeared with the musk of animal fear. You are a <i>driver</i>, God damn it, and you will not rest until - oh, what? The V8 has <i>how much</i> horsepower? Well, maybe just this once.</p>

<p>As both you and my psychiatrist know, I spend a lot of time thinking about Saabs. It’s not just their quirky air of confused design ideas, it’s not their principled resistance to General Motors bean-counting, and it’s not even their Scandinavian reputation for safety and snow-driving dominance. No, what makes me think about Saabs is the PCV system.</p><p>While most cars have poor PCV systems, and indeed their sexy Swedish cousins over at Volvo have especially bad ones, the Saab PCV systems are a whole new world of ludicrous untruth. Most mechanics only have to go as far as looking at them out of the corner of their eye before starting to gibber like a madman, unable to enunciate anything other than a deep urge for death.</p><p>A couple years ago, in fact, as part of a secret US military experiment, a complete replacement Saab PCV system was stocked in an Arizona Pep Boys under the brand name of Dorman. It was believed that being able to hold its entire form in one box, rather than to glimpse it only piece by maddening piece, would force the creation of a “super mechanic,” even though many lesser mechanics would no doubt become undone by it.</p><p>The military was wrong, however, and when the first customer appeared at the Pep Boys to pick up a nice new PCV system for their 9-3, they found that the box had been chewed open, as if from the inside, and the contents escaped. As the site was extinguished with a formal burn order, no survivors can be questioned, and it remains the stuff of forums myth, along with anyone who claims to have ever seen a 9-3 Turbo X wagon.</p>

<p>More conventional journalists wouldn’t dare to show up to the New York Auto Show with a suitcase full of an improvised contraption for pumping gallons of NyQuil Cold &amp; Flu directly into their veins, but I was no conventional journalist. Planes are yucky, and every time you get sick, an alternate universe version of you dies from it. I couldn’t take the risk that in this chance, that alternate universe would be my own.</p><p>Not many people know this, but an auto show is the primary origin for the development of new pathogens in the North American Exterior Empire. That’s why the CDC was doing valet service outside the conference centre, I was pretty sure. The reasons why it is so infectious seem obvious: lots of people in close proximity, lots of international air travel, and of course my fellow journalist touching every single button, darnable and knob in the interior so they can criticize its tawdry handfeel, like a wine connoisseur on BBC motorsports television.</p><p>I was different. I didn’t need to touch cars in order to judge them: I just needed a good head full of the non-narcotic cough syrup I carried in my bag and, more importantly, a few minutes with each of the confused PR staff that clogged each booth. At most auto shows, these would be dealership employees, confused about not just feature sets, but colours and words. Here, they were product-planning executives, high-octane PR types, and upper management, eager to see the anxious and jealous stares of their rivals at the sight of their new-for-2019 product. I could get the <i>real dope</i> out of them.</p><p>“So,” I asked, later in my hotel room, after I had strung up my interview apparatus on the shower curtain rod and begun to drain my crucified interviewee, “you guys got any <i>left-hand-thread</i> fasteners in this one?”<br/></p>

<p>If you can’t live with the Citroen XM, I have to question your fitness to live on this earth at all. The XM, for all its spheres-and-bongs construction, remains the finest automobile that isn’t the Citroen SM ever made. You’ve got grand touring performance paired with posh hydro-elastic ultraluxury, all wrapped up in a body more eighties than the actual decade. What more could you want?</p><p>Oh, right, good steering. Okay, <i>Italy</i>, I get what you’re saying. The XM does have a pretty crappy power-assist and you have to swagger around tight roads like a homeless drunk on high-octane methamphetamine sporadically beating a rainbow trout that he found inside the bread-bags he wears for shoes, but that’s all part of the charm. Chances are it’s just one of the eight or nine hydraulic filters littered around the car, and you can fix those in a parkade thousands of miles from home. Think of all the opportunities you’ll have to learn foreign languages’ words for “hydraulic flush” and “LHM double-joining union.”</p><p>Perhaps you are a connoisseur of fine car audio? The Citroen XM has every available option for it, unless you want to be able to play CDs. That is for more boorish, contemporary cars, and besides, it would ruin the comforting hum of interference that you get on the FM reception when you turn the dashboard lighting above “off.” It’s not like you should listen to the terrible music of your home country, anyway, it is much more important to pay attention to the road.</p><p>Speaking of the road, you will be extremely pleased to find that the XM features a conventional, extremely boring brake setup. There is a <i>pedal</i>, for God’s sake. You would think no true Citroen fan would appreciate this, and in fact they do not. That just means a lower resale value for you when you go to pick up your <i>second</i> XM, because probably you will want to have a parts car or two, just like every important French businessman had at the time.</p><p>For all these reasons and more, consider making the Citroen XM your incredibly expensive mistake today. All it will take is several thousand dollars in import fees and a tolerance for being called “that guy with the Saab.”<br/></p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there - bad people - who want to get their hands on the secret information that I possess. The joke’s on them, because I will reveal every aspect of their sordid conspiracy, here, live on the internet. Perhaps I will die for this, but I would rather die than to live in a world where the truth is unchallenged.</p><p>About a decade ago, the Japanese economy was in a lot of trouble. Productivity was poor, capital growth remained elusive, and the GDP just wasn’t moving the way it used to. They needed to do something. Working under the auspices of MITI, the Japanese trade ministry, the conspirators decided that they would return to the glory days of the Bubble Era. First, though, to test it, they would force a return to the 90s, because that wasn’t quite as far away and seemed a little less scary to them.</p><p>The project? To create new vehicles capable of spawning new sports-car-fan forums, packed to the gills with so little actual information that the very mechanism of North American society would grind to a halt. A triumphant Japan would again be able to surge forward, selling new kinds of unfathomable technology to the confused and divided Western people.</p><p>The campaign was begun. Deep within a Gunma laboratory, the Subaru BRZ was meticulously crafted to encourage the most delusional of forum posts. It had okay but not excellent power, confusing similarities to other vehicles, and worst of all, the ability to do skids. Still, the masters of the project hesitated. It was too big of a risk for only one of these vehicles to be introduced. Toyota stepped forward, bravely offering low-quality summer tires and vintage badging to the project. Now, two near-as-dammit identical cars would arrive at the same time, stoking an instant and completely pointless rivalry.</p><p>They were not entirely successful, but the lost productivity in every one of the millions of threads about changing the automatic in the BRZ that the poster’s mom bought for them into a dual-clutch manual transmission and LS-swapping it left an impact on an already-weak Western economy. Today, we can still feel the deep scars of the Frisbee Twins upon our way of life, unless you work as a body shop technician or eBay coilover seller.</p>

<p>They never found Joe Isuzu’s body, but I’m convinced it’s still somewhere out there. It had to be, because I wasn’t ready to admit that he was well and truly gone, even if Isuzu itself had left us years previous, during the ol’ unprecedented global recession (number 3 of 4 in that decade).</p><p>Joe Isuzu was the fast-talking, lying asshole who tried to sell us all off-brand Japanese sedans at a price slightly less than you would pay for a reliable, lovable Honda or Toyota. Those cars were boring, though, and in time Joe Isuzu’s brand of bald-faced braggadocio became a sort of rallying cry for all of us Isuzu faithful to hide behind.</p><p>Everything was going great up to IsuzuCon ‘06, that fateful keynote where they brought Joe Isuzu “back from retirement” to sell us a few more cars. The only big problem was, Isuzu didn’t really <i>have</i> any cars to sell us in 2006. He was out there on stage, waving at cardboard cutouts of ‘93 Impulses and ‘95 Rodeos, almost as if he had no idea that the world had changed around him. I could tell that his handlers, dressed in snappy Isuzu outfits, were definitely incentivized not to tell him about it.</p><p>I guess when I said “the <i>only</i> big problem,” what I actually meant was “one of the two big problems,” because there was also a furry convention next door, and it had been getting a little wild, if you’ll pardon the pun. Thing was, Joe Isuzu, being a creature of the early 90s, did not understand what he was looking at, and he paused mid-spiel, captivated by the glimpses of faux fur that he could see walking by in the adjacent hall. Before anyone could stop him, he had leapt from the stage and run next door.</p><p>When I last saw Joe Isuzu, he was getting his lights punched out by a guy who was dressed like a buck-naked Tony The Tiger. I think that’s how he would have wanted us to remember him.</p>

<p>It may be a new year, but I remember back when we didn’t expect that there would ever be a new year, ever again. I speak, of course, of my short time spent consulting on the Y2K crisis.</p><p>If you were born after the shocking episode of Fresh Prince in which Will Smith was forced to kill a traitorous DJ Jazzy Jeff, you probably weren’t old enough to appreciate the “millennium bug,” as we called it. Consultants from all across the world were activated, sent to bill thousands of hours making a computer understand that the number 2000 is not the same as the number 1900, or the number 0. It’s harder work than you’d think, especially if you were billing for the six-hour solid martini lunches that I used to shoot into my arm in a bathroom stall just outside of the Swiss border.</p><p>I worked for a Rhineland bank in those days, one of the ancient ones from back when money existed, and my coworker was a lifer called Dieter. Dieter used to tell me about how he used to have this great job in the auto industry, until they canned him for being “too alarmist” about the Y2K bug. Too alarmist for a German? That was nearly the equivalent of saying they were too anal-retentive, and I could not believe it.</p><p>Yet, as the ball dropped to usher in the year 2000, we wiped our brows and were overjoyed to have survived it without 747s dropping out of the sky and exploding into a million pieces. Dieter had disappeared, however, and months of searching could not turn up neither hide nor hair of him. I, naturally, had been forced by the authorities to remain in the country until the case could either be closed or they had sufficient reason to lose interest (for example, television might become good.)</p><p>Television did become good that spring, and so I returned home. It was only after I arrived that I figured out the terrible truth of the auto industry that Dieter had been trying to stop. That year, the first-generation Audi Allroad was released onto North American roads, and to claim its manifold defects were the result of the Y2K bug is bordering on praise for Audi.</p>

<p>As a volunteer police officer, there are many perks to the job. For instance, I get discount prices on acid-grade ammunition for my bag of personal firearms. That’s pretty nice. Also, I get to tell other cops to fuck off when they pull me over for felony speeding. The most valuable thing, though, is that I get to look through the arrest records, because some of them are goddamn hilarious.</p><p>Last week, detectives finally cracked the Big Red gang. Someone was selling Honda Big Reds to teenagers, knowing full well that they were going to kill those kids. After years of being bolstered by anti-drug panic, the laws could not be more clear: it was attempted murder. The fact that Honda Big Reds did not technically classify as a dangerous opiate did not bother our crack squadron of lawyers, and it definitely didn’t bother the judges enough to make them miss their tee times to overthrow our case.</p><p>When the small-displacement squad rolled up on the seller, the sworn statements get a little loopy. Not only did this guy live way out in the country and have a bundle of extremely dangerous three-wheelers, he owned <i>dozens</i> of them and was getting rid of them two or three at a time! The “Big Red gang” was just one guy.</p><p>As you know from the anti-Big Red commercials that the police department runs during prime time, just one Big Red XR250 three-wheeler is capable of wiping out an entire junior high graduating class in just under two months, and the introduction of Craigslist had shortened that time significantly. Here was this guy sitting on a bundle of ‘em, probably hoarded from their original ban in 1983.</p><p>He told us he thought the ban had lifted, that it would be okay to start dealing trikes again. He was dead wrong, and when the men and women of law enforcement moved in, he didn’t have a leg to stand on, possibly because his limbs were pinned underneath his getaway vehicle, which hit a small bump and spontaneously flipped end-over-end thirty times before crushing his pelvis and both femurs.</p><p>Thing was, the evidence record says they only managed to take three of the Big Reds into custody. The rest just disappeared somehow between the time the cops showed up and the time the CSIs got done fingerprinting the place. Maybe that’s why the higher-ups told us not to mention all the cop deaths from trike overdose in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The only thing in life I have ever truly loved is that sweet sticky nectar known as grey RTV. You can mash that thing in anywhere that a gasket-designing engineer phoned it in, and in a lot of places where you shouldn’t. Yet, RTV did not love me back. I wrote many notes on heart-shaped stationery to the Permatex corporation, ever yearning for acceptance.</p><p>Every day I would return to the hardware store, and see on the shelves that there was still no such thing as aerosol RTV in my beleaguered nation. Sure, the politicians had their ideas as to why: more stringent safety regulations, the flaming hole in the ozone yawning sunburnt death onto us, communists who wanted to raise our taxes. I felt strongly that some of those reasons were wrong, but still no aerosol RTV.</p><p>My garage was clustered with sticky wads of old nitrile gloves, sacrificed unnecessarily to smooth over-applied ultraglobs of room-temperature-vulcanizing silicone sealant. Those gloves had died long before the end of their useful life: it was a pity that I did not have the chance to even punch a sharp metal bracket with them, tearing them from stem to stern on at least one knuckle before begrudgingly throwing them away after the now-exposed skin of my hands became blacker than the gloves ever were.</p><p>It was then that I saw it in the trunk of a junkyard Camry: a small aerosol can. Quickly, I checked the odometer: in <i>miles</i>. This car had travelled far from its homeland of America, and died here. Was it fate? I reached out to grasp the RTV can, and smuggled it quickly into my toolbag and then under my overcoat to keep it away from envious eyes: all others at the Pick N Pull would know at a hundred-yard glance that I had the legendary applicator.<br/></p><p>When I got home, I somehow had nothing requiring a gasket. In a frenzy, I pulled the oilpan free from a parts Civic, and shook the can to prepare it for its destiny. The marble inside rattled helplessly, betraying the empty state of the can. In denial, I pushed the nozzle. Nothing came out but a limp spurt.</p><p>It was then that I remembered something odd about the Camry: its engine had become a strange flat shade of grey, almost as if someone had tried to seal oil leaks by randomly spraying the entire thing with sealant.</p>

<p>Everyone said it would be really hard to become a world-famous game designer, but it wasn’t at all. I had made my breakthrough with a meticulously researched simulator of cooking shinkansen cuisine, and now it was time to collect my small-pond fame of being the newly-crowned king of the Japanese games industry.</p><p>Thing was, I had spent all my time in the country researching the little snacks that the JR chefs had banged together. I had put little or no effort into understanding anything more than the rudimentary Japanese required for a white man to fumble through the process of buying beer from the greasy 7-Eleven next to my apartment building. When it came time for the plaudits from the games industry press, and more importantly, the fanboys, I didn’t understand anything more complicated than “nice weather today.”</p><p>It was decided in the cab over that my representative, the one from the publisher, would do most of the talking. Anyone who got close enough would be gently fobbed off onto the hired help, be referred directly to the brochures. If nothing else, it would add to my air of international mystery.</p><p>I realized that I should have spent a little more time in the library and a lot less in the kitchen when my representative got up to introduce the game.</p><p>“And now, I’m proud to introduce the creator of <i>Tube Meat</i>!” he barked excitedly into a microphone before thousands of screaming fans.<br/></p>

<p>When I was a kid, I was lucky to escape with my life. It turned out that the warm, comforting playschool environment in which I had been raised and educated during my formative years was actually a suicide cult dedicated to the worship of the Mitsubishi Starion. Years of follow-on therapy with court-ordered psychiatrists taught me that the experience had long-lasting effects on my values and motivations as they pertained to automobile ownership.<br/></p><p>Convincing though Father Astron had been, I felt that there was some other blame to go around. When I visited my parents individually in their own gender-specific prisons, I asked them sometimes about why they had decided to give up normal society and flee to the woods, to live alongside a man who told them that double-wishbone suspension was destroying the spirit of humanity and that soon the Cosmic Balance Shaft would even out the buzz and shake of the world in their favour.</p><p>“I was no sucker,” was all my dad would ever admit, now far enough away from Father that his weekly sermons had become dull and weak in his mind, banished to the back by the day-to-day chores of prison life. “I didn’t think the Starion had what it took to win in Group B.”<br/></p>

<p>If you’re like me, you frequently skip out on well-deserved meals in order to get just a few more things done on your project car. It never pays to skip those meals: you’ll make more mistakes, and might even pass out from exhaustion in the middle of the shop before you can finish thrashing your daily driver together before work the next day.</p><p>A lot of guys like to store snacks in their garage. Sounds like a great idea, but it’s been proven by real scientists that hot food can increase the speed of wrenching performance by up to two hundred percent. Don’t believe us? Just look at your local junkyard’s taco truck - their customers are hoovering down al pastor and yanking out 2GRs all day long.</p><p>The taco truck, then, the ideal food provider for people such as us. Wait, though, there’s a problem: despite being a <i>truck</i>, the taco truck doesn’t <i>move</i>.</p><p>Stop living in the past, and sign up for our rolling-wrap delivery service. Using it couldn’t be simpler. Just like in Spy Hunter, when you’ve achieved enough miles and gotten within range, mash the flashing “Taco Van” button on your dashboard. We’ll find you, drive in front of your projected route (developed through sophisticated artificial intelligence), and drop the back ramp at highway speed. All you have to do is line ‘er up and drive inside, where we will serve you delicious hot food without having to stop.</p><p>It’s green, too: not only can you shut your engine off inside the truck, but you really should. Our cooks keep fainting from carbon monoxide poisoning in the kitchen and it’s becoming really hard to dispose of them, what with every police department in the city now subscribed to our service. No idling!</p>

<H1>Ask a BMW Owner</H1>
<p>To get the new year started off right, I’ve decided to let my friend, Dr. Cornelius Winthread III, owner of many fine BMW lease documents, answer some questions that the readers may have.</p><p><b>What’s the ideal pizza delivery car? I am a teenager who is just starting out in the world of driving and want something that can make my deliveries safely, but not cost a lot in gas.</b></p><p>I remember purchasing pizza a few years ago. It was in this delightful place just outside of Frankfurt, where they had an authentic caricature of an Italian gentleman spraypainted on the walls. A fascinating meal, but nothing on the order of sous vide foie gras, my usual snack for when I’m feeling lazy and my maid Ilsa has not been keeping up with ein duties.</p><p>To get back to your question, I believe a Certified Pre-Owned™ 2015 BMW 740iL is the ideal car for your purposes. Depreciation has caught up to this fine ride, and it will save you enough over new that you can afford to repair the common defects in the ignition system, electrical systems, ECU, batteries, rear seats and airbag suspension. If you have good credit, the lease can be had for under $950/mo, which any teenager in my neighbourhood can easily get with his fund interest.</p><p>Only a man of ill breeding would buy this car outright: remember the first rule of tax deductibility! Always lease a vehicle such as this.</p><p><b>I’m looking at a 1989 BMW 325e and a 2007 BMW 540i for track days. Which one will cost less to operate in the long run?</b></p><p>A lot of the lower classes these days are partaking in “winding,” I think it is called. I believe that for your purposes, the 540i is the more reliable choice. Not only do you have more room to carry excess prostitutes, but the greater ride comfort means more of them will appear intact if and when the constabulatory gets involved.</p><p>However, there is another option: have you considered leasing a Certified Pre-Owned™ 2015-2016 BMW 435i xDrive? Sure, you cannot slide the vehicle around like my pool boy, but it is hard to put a price on being able to impress your neighbours. Ask your operational accountant if it can be swung, and do not forget to test your golf bags in the trunk before signing your name on the dotted line if you have a regular salesman who is less attentive to detail than my Alfred!</p><p><b>Cornelius, my wife is addicted to painkillers and keeps sending me pictures of the pink seat covers she wants to install in her 2012 BMW X3 Individual. What is the cheapest route of divorce that will still allow me to play at her father’s country club?</b></p><p>Perhaps you should ask the previous individual if he has a pimp or copper thief that can dispose of her for you. I have a regular man who handles these kinds of things for me, and the most impressive thing about him is that he recently disposed of an ancient six-year-old car such as your soon-to-be-ex-wife’s X3 for a lease on a new Certified Pre-Owned™ 6-series Gran Coupé. It is so flashy that often his targets are hypnotized by the arrival of such a marvel of engineering, so held fast by how impressed they are with his breeding and mannerisms that they cannot resist the killing blow when it finally comes.</p>

<p>There’s an old saying we have down at the bar, “if you have to use a Mitsubishi Debonair as a white-noise machine, your office is too fucking loud.” I think it’s Polish or something. On the face of it, this argument is uncontroversial; nobody at all who has been around an idling Mitsubishi Debonair thinks its snuffly exhaust and quiet lifter-tick can possibly overwhelm an entire open-office-concept full of shrieking harpies and the CEO’s harem of eternally pregnant Malinois at maximum heat.</p><p>However, as with all platitudes, some asshole on the Internet is going to come and argue that it is in fact false. Perhaps you are one of these assholes, and so it is for you, and people like you, that I embark upon my dark project.</p><p>To test my theory, I applied for a chance to be on a popular television show where I would change job positions with the CEO of my employer, and then let him see how the sausage is made down on the ol’ office floor. Once he had his ridiculous fake mustache and I had my morning gold-plated snuff box of high-octane cocaine, I was ready to put the argument to the test.</p><p>After one trip to a Japanese auction site, enriching both myself and my shady compatriot Dr. Hsu from the company coffers, I had a primo example of the awkwardly-proportioned ‘89 Debonair placed in the development bullpen, leaking hydraulic fluid and with a distinctive whine that could be nothing else but a loose supercharger belt. This front-drive mini-luxobarge (luxoyacht?) was ready to spring on the suckers - er, <i>loyal employees</i> - under my command.</p><p>Leading the camera crew with me into the office, I began my presentation, trying hard to ignore the former CEO so as not to tip my hand to the ruse. Nobody else seemed to notice the camera crew following him around, even as he fucked up very simple tasks like making coffee and nearly got fired every ten minutes by a succession of angry middle-managers.</p><p>Soon, the purpose of the Debonair was described, and implemented. I departed for a power lunch, and four hours later when I returned, the office’s conversation volume was well above the noise level produced by the Debonair, which considering the carbon monoxide, was remarkable. This office was, in fact, too fucking loud.</p><p>At the end of the episode, during the normal segment in which you are supposed to talk about how hard the other guy’s job is, I had nothing really to say. I had wasted a gobsmacking amount of company resources, not to mention an irreplaceable Japanese near-luxury car, on settling a five-dollar bar bet. The CEO mostly just had a list of people he wanted to fire, which turned out to be all of my immediate and distant managers.</p><p>As I was leaving his office, now stripped of my powers, I realized that I had not reversed the policy. I first became aware of this when, trying to use the freight elevator as a smoking lounge, I discovered it was crammed to the gills with Hyundai Grandeurs. Leave it to the company man to cheap the fuck out on a good idea.</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you about the time I got fired from the United Nations? It turned out that we had different ideas about what to do with their so-called “aid money,” and that didn’t involve air-dropping a series of really awesome Baja Bugs on impoverished war-torn nations. It was a lot cheaper than their oh-so-bougie Land Cruisers, I pled at the Hague, but nobody was willing to listen.</p><p>Later, in prison, I realized the consequences of my actions: I had been filed into the Volkswagen section of the war-crimes prison. The cell across from me was occupied by Hans, a man who unironically owned a Volkswagen Jetta (”Wolfsburg,” he would sharply remind me every single time I mentioned just the model name on its own). He wasn’t even German, I don’t think, but he loved his crayon-smelling sedan more than any other human being in history has ever loved a car.</p><p>After a few months of trading bench-racing barbs with Hans about whether or not a base Cobalt can outrun a Mk3 Golf GTI, it eventually occurred to me to ask Hans what he was in for. Surely, if he was in the war-crimes prison as I was, for a Volkswagen-related offense, it must have been truly egregious. Hans hesitated to answer at first, staring at the bottom of his cell and shuffling his feet.</p><p>A small voice piped up from the cell beside me. In prison, there are really no secrets, and everyone knew Hans’ story from long before I had begun my punishment.</p><p>“He had a really bad exhaust leak and left the car idling outside a synagogue while he was replacing headlight bulbs,” said the muffled voice.<br/></p>

<p>The financial services industry has always held a special appeal for me. Perhaps it’s the chance to get rewarded for unmitigated greed at the expense of my customers, or, no, that was the one. Recently, I became aware of a scam wherein financial advisors would phone up rich people and tell them which old cars to buy, so as to trap those cars forever inside a climate-controlled vault while waiting for them to appreciate.</p><p>In other words, these monsters would turn a perfectly good motor vehicle into an immobile investment vehicle. Something had to be done, and as is typical for my adventures, that something is making a shit ton of money off old rich people who are too dumb to Google my name plus “scammer.” One trip to the business card printing shop later, I was already in command of a hundred million dollar portfolio and sipping on free-flowing cocaine from a repurposed Big Gulp dispenser in the office kitchen.</p><p>“Look, I need to know what cars to buy next week at Barrett-Jackson,” said my customer, a relatively high-placed politician who definitely did not have the salary to support such a purchase.<br/></p><p>“Don’t go to Barrett-Jackson, man, you gotta get race cars from the source. Have you ever heard of a little something called the 24 Hours of LeMons?”<br/></p><p>I only realized the grave harm that I had committed upon the world in retrospect, when I tried to find a semi-mint Kia Amanti for purchase as a daily driver slash rallycross weapon. There quite simply were none left. Instead, the market was clogged with something called “Ferraris,” which seemed like incredibly impractical, rust-prone Italian cars. They didn’t even have good trunks!</p>

<p>No man is ever free of the rules and constraints of his homeland. For me, I had left the glorious land of Canada years and years ago, in search of rust-free hoopties with which to pop clutches in. Homesickness eventually set in, though, and I soon found myself searching for a truly Canadian car.</p><p>It wasn’t enough to simply buy Iraqi Taxis and other Canadian-made G-bodies, for those were enforced upon Canadians to construct based on a master plan constructed by some American ultramanager. I could not even reliably convince myself that a Ford Frontenac of all cars was Canadian enough to assuage my guilt at having left the land of my birth.</p><p>There was nothing left to do except start my own car company - a truly Canadian car company, and in the spirit of Canada it was founded somewhere in the northwestern United States because rent was really cheap. Our initial model was called the Hoser, and it was a beaut.</p><p>Rather than four-wheel drive, we opted for double-double drive, with a confusing array of gear selectors proffered to the driver with an exhortation that there was really no wrong choice to make. Add to that the sprightly feel by having built the entire frame, Morgan-style, exclusively from beaver-felled maple curved by authentic NHL hockey-stick heat guns, and you had yourself a vehicle that could work its way through both an unpaved mountain road or one of those annoying tight corners in parking lots with a decorative snow warning flag on it that you keep hitting the curb with your back wheels while turning right.</p><p>It was truly a fantastic car, but we had made one terrible mistake, one glaring oversight so atrocious that it could not be forgiven even by my fellow apology-addicts. The cupholders were too shallow to sufficiently hold a Timmies cup. Hit a bump, and the god damn lid pops off and gets coffee everywhere.</p>

<p>The era of taco trucks was coming to a close. At every junkyard, proprietors would tell me the same thing, graven-faced, although admittedly my Spanish was a terrible and my Tagalog made my Spanish look good by comparison. Soon, the food drones were coming, they all warned me. Their way of life was on borrowed time.</p><p>Some billionaire on the west coast had finally had enough of having to go outside for his truck-based food, built a bunch of crazy fucking helicopter robots that would swarm you with burritos, quesadillas and Monte Cristos whenever you wanted. It actually sounded pretty good to me, but I realized that this industrial automation had outsize negative effects on the small business population in the field of “food that I like to eat that isn’t too far from the junkyard.”</p><p>Naturally, to solve a problem, I did what everyone does to solve their problems: I decided to get mired in local politics. As the Mayor, I now had an incredible amount of power over the police force, which I generally used by picking up a red telephone on my desk and ordering them to arrest a squeegee kid I saw on the way in. Eventually, I got tired of demanding that street urchins be interred, and made the call to equip all police officers with anti-drone net guns, courtesy of our friends in the military-industrial complex.</p><p>Everything went great, until the junkyards themselves closed down, leaving the taco trucks without customers. Now that hip millennials were lassoing drones with police-surplus net guns and riding them in order to get where they needed to go, cars were obsolete, and so nobody needed automobile parts anymore. Long since immobilized from disuse, it was not that the owners had any chance of reviving the trucks and moving to somewhere customers actually existed.</p><p>Sometimes in the evening I sit on the balcony of my substantial City Hall office with a whisky sour, and I look out over my city. Against the sunset, the sky is clogged with swarming robots delivering hot Mexican tube-shaped food. I miss the taco trucks, but more than that, I miss the thrill of stealing a pants pocket full of relays.</p>

<p>If you had worked for the Chuck E. Cheese family entertainment division, as I have, you would understand that there are precautions that have to be taken when you wind one of the franchisees down.</p><p>Just like an embassy, the only safe way to shut it down is to destroy all potentially-proprietary information, and burn the flag. In our case, the flag was the head of the Chuck E. Cheese costume itself, and for about a decade, I was the guy who was sent in to destroy them. Each franchise was, along with other corporate-supplied effects, given a propane torch to be used only at the direction of upper management.</p><p>I was that upper management.</p><p>Most jobs were simple: I’d arrive at the airport, immediately rent the fastest thing they had on the lot, and then get as much “shareholder value” as possible out of the rental insurance on the way to the restaurant. I’d destroy the head (more on this later), shake the hands of the front-line soldiers, thank them for their service, late lunch at the airport Chili’s, wheels up and in full-Vicodin unconscious mode by 2100.</p><p>Things were simple. Maybe one or two Chucks would go under a year. Something went wrong deep in the guts of America, though, and we caught it on the chin. Soon, I was spending every single day on the road, each afternoon of my life capped by staring into the dead eyes of a mascot’s head before I put the torch to it. Sometimes, the franchise was so dead that they had no idea that it was over for them before I would pull into the lot, the muffler of my automatic V6 Mustang convertible blaring a trumpet of impending pink slips that the Angel Gabriel would have been proud of. If you had asked me, perhaps at one of those airport Chili’s, if it bothered me, I would have told you no. I was doing a job, and that job needed to be done.</p><p>One morning, in Tulsa, things went wrong. Now, little stuff happened all the time on the job. Maybe one of the high-school employees took an ear off the head for safe-keeping, a manager wanted to pose nude with it and borrowed it for the evening. I didn’t judge: I could just as easily burn the Avatar of Chuck to cinders in a suburban basement as I could the rear warehouse of a shopping mall. There was only one rule: The Children Must Never See. To break the illusion for them that Chuck E. Cheese was a real, benevolent entity, made of one solid piece like them, was to invite the threat of Forever Nightmares. We never really understood why such an obviously fake beast had such control over them - Takashi-san in Incident Control thought it might have something to do with an “inverse uncanny valley,” but he drank a lot at work and certainly wasn’t in the trenches of Middle America with me every single day - but certainly no child could see me burning the flesh off of Chuck E’s carbon-steel skull wire.<br/></p><p>The first indication that something had gone wrong in Tulsa is that there were more heads than there should have been. Todd, the franchise manager, had only been there a few weeks, and told me that he didn’t understand why the warehouse was entirely stocked with <i>dozens</i> of Chuck heads, their dead googly-eyed faces all staring straight ahead. I should have been more wary than I was, but at that point I simply did not give a shit anymore. I rolled my sleeves up and had a very productive afternoon of burning mouse skulls.</p><p>Soon, I realized that I had been talking to myself. This hadn’t happened before, perhaps because my exposure to the heads had been so limited - one and done - no franchise could afford a lot of them. Now, I was beginning to realize why Omura down in Unrestricted Research had been sending the memos about the “psychic isolators.” I burned faster and faster, until at last I was at the final Chuck head of Tulsa #1137.</p><p>I’ll never know if it was the light, or the organic vapours from torching hundreds of mouse heads a year in an enclosed, unventilated space, but something horrible passed between us in that room. The mouth moved - the <i>mouth</i> is <i>not to move</i>, said the costume standards - and it started to speak to me, in my own voice.</p><p>The next thing I remember is waking up in the parking lot of Tulsa #1137, the building engulfed in a roaring flame before me. A pizza grease fire was nothing new to me, and in my denial, I forced myself to believe that’s what had happened - an inadvertent arson from a pimple-faced teenager who didn’t know how to work the oven and smoke pot at the same time. I turned to face my rescuer. Todd stared at the flames, saying nothing.</p><p>“We got it, right?” I asked Todd, who didn’t respond. Near-catatonic, he never took his eyes off the area of the building in which I had worked. As the firefighters arrived, Todd did a perfect heel-click 180, and walked away from the parking lot into the darkness of the Winter Solstice, never to be seen again.<br/></p><p>There was something in his walk, though. Almost like he expected to have a tail and a really big head.</p>

<p>It started like pretty much any other day: browsing Craigslist for sweet deals on dirt-cheap used mopeds. For as long as I could remember, small-displacement motorized transport had gotten me out of bed in the morning, which at least was better than a heroin addiction in one respect (it certainly wasn’t cheaper). There was just something about the moped’s humble intersection of the beloved-by-hipsters bicycle and the beloved-by-Italians motor scooter, and although I had no hope of qualifying that something, I definitely enjoyed ripping two-stroke anger down the bicycle lanes of my town.</p><p>Something strange had happened this morning, I came to realize while sending out my first batch of lowball-offer emails: they had all been sold just moments before I got there. It made no sense. My mind, already tilted towards paranoia in the best of times, began to run rampant: there was no doubt now that this was some kind of organized conspiracy against me and my interests. I enumerated my enemies: perhaps my opponent was the pro-bike-lane mafia, or any number of the people which I have inconvenienced by my ring-a-ding-ding approach to spitting hot oil into the faces of their children when doing big-throttle wheelies through a playground zone.</p><p>My first stop was Nico. He had no last name, because it was badly injured during the trip over from Malta and had to be amputated by a special team of veterinarians. In what was surely a sign of guilt, Nico took off running as soon as he heard the distinctive pregnant-chainsaw sound of my Puch approaching. Without a big-bore kit like mine, though, it didn’t take much of a chase before I caught up to his Vespa and knocked him off with a well-placed pool cue struck across the back of his neck.</p><p>The resulting interrogation was fruitful. Last week, a man in a red suit had come by his hoard of scooters, tried to make sure that he wasn’t selling any mopeds, and definitely wouldn’t sell any to me. It was proof positive that at least someone was working directly against my interests, and so I graciously thanked Nico and wished him luck in recovering from the broken ribs and concussion with which I had given him.</p><p>Without a specific lead, I returned home, only to find a man in a red suit on my roof. I immediately popped a u-turn and ramped the Puch off the back hatch of my neighbor’s crookedly-street-parked EcoSport, launching it onto the roof. However, I slightly misjudged the integrity of my shingles, and rather than pulling alongside the figure, I punched a hole in my roof and knocked the both of us down into my master bathroom.</p><p>When the dust cleared, the red-suited menace was impaled through the chest on one of the many lengths of rusty expansion chambers I left in the bathtub for cleaning. I tried to get answers, but only received in return a knowing nod and a wink. At last, he touched his index finger to his red, cherry nose, and died, leaving me with a convenient (if still messy) bathtub soaked in arterial blood. If anything, I now knew less than I did before.</p><p>Walking downstairs, I was in such a fugue of anger that I didn’t notice a strange package beneath the Christmas tree before I tripped over it. Considering that it was only myself and the raccoon that lived under the deck here, I didn’t understand how this present had gotten here. A lead at last. Tearing into it, I realized that it was the front frame section of a Mini Riga moped, the once-pride of Ukrainian shitbike production.</p><p>I sat there for a few more minutes, taking it in. This was exactly what I had wanted, and now it was here. Did that mean the guy in the red suit was&hellip;?</p><p>Rushing upstairs, I searched the coat of the dead man. With fumbling fingers, I managed to work his wallet loose from his bloody pants, and take a look at the drivers’ license. It was exactly who I thought it would be, a true Christmas miracle.</p><p>A few minutes later, the police and coroner arrived. It was a surprisingly great time, and one of the police officers gave me a sticker for being a “Big Helper” with pulling the corpse off of the gore-slicked steel tubing. The mayor gave me a commendation for finally taking down the escaped mental patient who had been breaking into people’s homes over the last few years during the winter and leaving garbage inside.</p>

<p>Nobody loved the bubble Taurus wagon as much as I did, and I didn’t really love it at all. Via basic logic, however, that meant I was the biggest fan of bubble Taurus wagons in the world, and soon the angry owners of such vehicles began flocking to my front lawn in order to hawk me their shitboxes, yearning to be free of them.</p><p>I am not widely known as a man who is particularly good at resisting “a great deal,” and as such it should come as no surprise that my front forty was soon occupied nearly entirely by rotting manual-transmission (I have standards) bubble Taurus wagons. Luckily, as a man of some esteem in the local business community, the bylaw enforcement officers looked elsewhere for their quota, often to the unbroken line of overheating Taurus wagons idling on my street, waiting for me to pass judgment upon them and offer a crisp twenty dollar bill from my wallet.</p><p>Eventually, it became obvious to me that at some point I needed to do something with all these mouldering seven- and eight-seat Tauruses, and so I decided to do the humane thing and gently euthanize them. With the help of a local car dealership, I was able to Cash For Clunkers nearly half a dozen of these clattering Vulcan-motored abominations out of existence before I realized that I was crushing some fine-ass patch panels that could be sent to New England, the birthplace of rust.</p><p>Soon, I was the richest auto-body parts dealer on the planet, and all the states of New England were thick with revitalized Ford Taurus wagons. I even sponsored and stocked my own Super GT Silhouette series race team in Japan, where the third-generation Taurus was so beloved by Nipponese weirdos that even the slightest hint of someone importing parts to keep their strange-ass car alive drove them into an uncontrollable frenzy, resulting in the death of at least two junkyard operators in Hakone.</p><p>I didn’t have time to enjoy my newfound wealth, however: I had to replace at least three transmissions per day if I ever wanted to get out of my own driveway.</p>

<p>I owed my soul to the Snap-On man, this much was clear. No matter how much I told myself that with some cleverness I could get around needing those fancy diagnostic tools, exotic torque wrenches and oh-so-tempting 90 degree adapters, every time that little truck came tootling into my driveway, I could practically feel the pinch of the plasma-donation needle hooking up into my arm.</p><p>After the last incident, in which I somehow managed to finance a complete set of air ratchets because they were in a slightly different colour than the rest of my air ratchets, me and a bunch of the other guys from the shop got together and had a discussion about it. It was obvious that, alone, we were powerless to resist the lure of this tool-truck jezebel: but perhaps when united we would have the strength to oppose him.</p><p>Soon, our theory was put to the test. The Snap-On Man was no fool: he knew right away that something had changed in our place of work. Perhaps it was our newly confident postures, our steely gaze telling him to find a new place to push his candy. Or, it could have been the length of bike chain that Two-Braps Todd was carrying threateningly. Still, he knew that we must have some weakness, and so after a few circles of the lot, I saw him pull his truck up to the new guy.</p><p>“Say, you’re pretty new around here. You know what every mechanic needs?” he whispered into the air with his snake-like tongue, luring the FNG ever closer.</p><p>I couldn’t reach him in time, but Todd could. Later, he would explain to me that he had a promising career in track and field before he fell in with the wrong crowd in high school and started fixing Dodge Caravans. Todd looked at me then, meeting my gaze through the plexiglass window of his visiting-hours cubicle, and told me that when it happened, all he could think of was trying to remove the exhaust on a Stow ‘N’ Go. We couldn’t have stopped him if we tried.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that I am the only one who appreciates the subtle beauty of the 1989 Mazda 323. Its pseudo-curved form gives the appearance of harsh 80s angularity, but is not a slave to it. The headlights and grille are carved, trucklike, from one solid plane, offering a fresh respite from the haze of sealed-beam misery that the domestic market still slavishly obeyed. There’s something more, too, something that I have dedicated my life to understanding.</p><p>Nobody at my gallery opening understands. They see only a museum stuffed to the gills with obsessive photographs of BG 323 windshields, A-pillars, headlights, door handles, dashboards. On top of that, there are my hand-carved sculptures of every component of the car, perhaps the only available moulds of the tail lights that are available on this continent. There are some polite remarks, a few photojournalists snap photographs of my jawline at flattering angles, and at least one drunk stares deeply into the picture of a 323 in a dark highway tunnel that I have lovingly painted on black velvet before devouring the hors d’oeuvres and vomiting on the front steps.</p><p>Perhaps, I realize, their lack of connection with the work is because I myself am a fraud. I admire the 323 from afar: my obsessive Craigslist and Kijiji search has yet to turn up even one suitable candidate. All of my works are based on cars that I have spotted on the street, cell-phone snaps for my “dream wall” that have been cropped artistically in order to justify opening a gallery exhibit. There, I felt, owners would be tempted to bring their 323s, perhaps even ones they did not want anymore and would happily sell to someone who must be such a fan of the car.</p><p>Yet, nobody appeared. I sat on those front steps, and tried not to smell the vomit of drunken art gazers rapidly cooling on the marble. Was the humble hatchback so unloved that nobody gave a thought to it? They threw it into the trash when something better had come along, way back in the 90s? No. There had to be a way to find my dream low-priced economy hatchback.</p><p>Turning to the gallery owner, I asked him: did he know anyone who ran a show in Hiroshima? I was going to take this bitch international no matter what it took, even if I had to paint a wiring diagram on a single grain of rice.</p>

<p>It’s never a good idea to meet your heroes. Luckily, I had managed to make it to a relatively prosperous adulthood by never having any heroes. Astronauts? Just underpaid government employees who got in a city bus headed straight up. Life-saving surgeons? Got lucky. Inspirational civil-rights leaders? If they’re so good, why am I still waiting in stop-and-go traffic? I thought I had life all figured out, that there was no need for role models. Then I found the perfect one.</p><p>Now, on first blush, you might think a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle is nothing that you should pattern your life on. The clutch cable linkage is overcomplicated, rust holes in the heater channels threaten your life with carbon monoxide poisoning, and let’s not forget about that whole Hitler thing. But gaze a little deeper, aided by the carbide-steel blade of a sawzall and some little friends known as “fibreglass aftermarket body panels,” and it’s starting to look up.</p><p>Especially by the time that the torsion bars are adjusted to add a highly enjoyable level of ride height to the proceedings, and grandpa-grip farmland tires slapped onto the rear end, it becomes obvious: the 1963 Volkswagen Beetle is beloved because it is so <i>versatile</i>. For instance, the owner of this bug could, for instance, jump a mall fountain, whether that mall fountain is indoors or (as is the custom in Deep California) outside. Sure, the stock suspension doesn’t quote-unquote “like” it, but it endures, like the hero it is.</p><p>Never meet your heroes, indeed. You know what, they’re right: when I banked off the mall fountain and landed directly on Santa’s Village, I got to meet a lot of cops. Believe me, those guys are <i>terrible</i> heroes, no sense of humour at all.</p>

<p>I wasn’t even into the “crying and praying to an uncaring god” phase of my fortnightly drunken Dr. Mario marathon, and already I was finding it difficult to concentrate on the variety of pills that cascaded before me. What definitely wasn’t helping was the rolled Renault rally car posed, beetle-like, in the shattered wreckage of what was once my living room. Once again, my roommates lived in bald-faced contempt of the rules and bylaws of the condo association.</p><p>When they first replied to my Craigslist ad seeking roomies, I figured that their strange mannerisms were purely due to the fact that they were Finnish exchange students, not yet knowledgeable about the way that the hustle and bustle of North American life compelled you to, say, drive very fast while not paying attention to the road. In fact, they were so intense about proper winter driving, lecturing one another to take careful note of the radius of all the turns to and from their place of work.</p><p>Their safety obsession even extended to standing in the ditches to excitedly hoot “OI OI OI OI” at passing drivers whenever they started to have a little oversteer. Once, I had joined them in the ditches, but lost interest at approximately the same time I lost consciousness from the contents of their heavily-insulated Thermos flask, which seemed to be filled with paint thinner and nitroglycerin.</p><p>Things really came to a head when those nice Polish dudes moved in next door, and brought along with them a Subaru Impreza with no interior. This infuriated the Finns, and I rarely saw them after that, disappearing into the workshop after hoovering up plates of the lukewarm fish that was their only sustenance. In fact, aside from their regular rent cheques and the occasional shot-to-death Russian soldier in the yard, I would have had no idea that they even still existed until the Renault 5 Turbo came flying through my front windows.</p><p>As mad as I was, it was hard to avoid getting caught up in their enthusiasm. Along with a group of bystanders, we rolled the French shitmobile back onto its wheels and hooted “OI OI OI OI” as they sped off through my kitchen, scattering heirloom plates and cutlery every which way beneath the fat rally tires of victory.</p>

<p>“Ha ha! It is us, the Russians! You have been working for us all along,” said Dmitri, the Russian spy who I had been working for all along. He wasn’t wrong necessarily, but he did have a depressingly low opinion of me that I didn’t quite relish being exposed so directly to. Regardless, I decided to push for what I was owed.<br/></p><p>I drew my snub-nose revolver from its ankle holster and levelled it at Dmitri. “Not so fast, motherfucker. Take me to the Fiats.” It turned out that Dmitri wasn’t really much of a “car guy,” per se, and so I had to patiently explain the entire mess to him so that he would understand just why I had been selling so many valuable satellite secrets to him - and then take me to the Fiats.</p><p>My arm was just starting to get tired from having to hold the revolver by the time that I had completed my mini-dissertation and circled the Lada-Fiat-VAZ-Yugo connection in an accented whiteboard marker for emphasis. It had taken over an hour, but Dmitri now seemed to understand, and beckoned me into his car, a mid-range but gently dented Volga Siber.</p><p>I tried not to look at the depressing Chrysler Sebring interior as Dmitri bragged about how he, too, enjoyed cars, and after only several years of working hard at the FSB he had been able to finally buy his dream luxury car, in which we were unhappily travelling. I knew then that he would never understand how I could have traded those useless national security secrets for fantastic Fiat content.</p><p>Dmitri looked on with confusion as I sorted through the vast variety of delicious Fiat-analogues on offer at a dingy Vladivostok used car lot. There was no doubt in my mind that he was trying to figure out how he could have been so outmaneuvered by my flawless spycraft.</p>

<p>Let he who hasn’t enslaved a bundle of Chinese grad students to hack together a provisional artificial intelligence for autonomous cars throw the first stone, I’m pretty sure the Bible says. You can say what you will about Job’s struggles, but there’s no way they could have compared to how much it bothered me to have to turn up the voltage on Chu’s shock collar until he stopped fucking up the unit tests.</p><p>The cause of my concern was simple. I wanted fat government dollars, and the projects they expected were still relatively immature enough that I thought I could score said dollars with merely a responsibly small amount of near-electrocuting a McMansion full of grad students. Thing was, I just wasn’t getting the results that I wanted, and I was also getting pretty close to the point where I’d have to buy the large-breed kind of dog shock collars, which, when added to the kidnapping and the pizza deliveries, would put this whole endeavour into the red.</p><p>“We are sorry, Mr. Switch,” said Chu. He was the de facto spokesman of the group, not only because of his excellent command of spoken English but also his ability to constantly break the build, which is why the others opted to try to keep him in a management role as much as possible. “But the car, it is killing all of the pedestrians.”<br/></p><p>It turned out that during their early-morning beta test, the Pontiac Venture I had paid for them to stud with a level of computational power that would send us to and from the moon approximately nine hundred billion times over (one gently used Raspberry Pi) had not performed very well. In fact, the test minivan lit up a burnout outside the test lab, ran over a number of pedestrians, triggered six photo radar cash machines, hit-and-ran four Lexuses in a Starbucks drive-through and engaged in a forty-five minute police chase at highway speeds, which it eventually evaded by driving through a populated daycare without slowing down.</p><p>I considered his words.</p><p>“Ship it,” I said. “This thing is still better at driving than most people on my commute.”<br/></p><p>Within a few weeks, I was happily spending my DARPA automated-traffic grand prize. A big thousand smackaroonies. After the feds came and took away all the research, source code, and the Pontiac Venture in order to use it as the basis for a new autonomous murder platform, you would think it would seem like a poor exchange, but they also took Chu, and that motherfucker just could not stop breaking builds.</p>

<p>“You know, not long ago, Daihatsu still had a single US employee named - I think - Robert,” said my friend Nik, after reaching into his basket of vintage NOS Daihatsu parts and coming up empty on parts for my project Rugger. “You should hit him up sometime. I probably still have his phone number.”<br/></p><p>I called that phone number, and a terrified, small voice emerged. “Robert?” I asked.</p><p>“Who wants to know?” shrieked the voice, in amongst a rustling of paper and suspiciously parts-box-sounding cardboard.<br/></p><p>We spoke for awhile longer, and Robert’s strange tale took shape before us. It seemed that as Mother Nippon abandoned the Daihatsu brand in North America, one of the accountants hadn’t scrolled far enough down on the Excel spreadsheet when it came time to make the list of people to shitcan. Robert dodged the axe, and thus now was the de facto president of Daihatsu USA by battlefield promotion.</p><p>The Japanese, not expecting the creativity of good old American deception and deceit, would never think to check again, and so he received his paycheques every two weeks along with the standard cost-of-living increase at the end of the year. I hesitated to ask about bonuses, because it wasn’t like Daihatsu was moving a lot of new cars, but he chuckled and let me know that he had an entire parts warehouse to sell off from which to make his quarterly sales goals.</p><p>“You won’t tell them I was here, will you?” Robert’s voice was quivering now. He knew that his position was illicit, and that if I made enough of a stink to the media, the hastily-cut YouTube video featuring screaming car guys trying to break into the Daihatsu parts warehouse for a laugh would inevitably lead to his firing. A good man wouldn’t abuse this position of power, would be understanding of Robert’s circumstances and work to maintain a healthy relationship for both parties.</p><p>“That depends on whether you have the ability to authorize a factory-backed Daihatsu Charade racing program, <i>Mister President</i>.”<br/></p>

<p>I awoke from uneasy slumber to find myself staring into the glowing eye of late-night infomercials. In flickering terrorvision, the anonymous yet statistically-well-distributed figures intoned to me about the need to improve my life, to make it better. It was car college. They could teach me how to make a living working on cars? To this point in my life, I hadn’t particularly resisted anything that shadowy figures demanded of me, and this was certainly no exception.</p><p>Picking up my phone, I took a few minutes to remember how to operate the “telephone” functionality of it, and then obediently dialled the number of the college. A sharp staccato shriek emerged from the receiver after the second ring, and I reflexively dropped the phone on my carpet, an $1800 visit to the Apple store dodged only by the mounds of spent cat hair having added extra cushioning to the worn factory underlay.</p><p>I called again, and this time, it sounded more like a rattling sound. A rattling sound that I had become all too familiar with. As the rod-knock rattle gave way to the tractory idle of a Subaru Impreza, I discovered the error of my ways. It <i>was</i> car college, I realized - a college for cars!</p><p>A few years later, I was burning through the entire quantity of kleenex that I had brought with me as I watched my self-driving, legally-limited-sentience Lexus do a celebratory graduation burnout onstage before launching into his valedictorian donut. They grow up so fast.</p>

<p>I knew that something had gone wrong in the depths of the infinite RockAuto metamind when I came home to find a suspiciously large box on my porch. Deploying my usual tactical knife assortment, I heard a sharp yelp emerge from the box, and a man followed.</p><p>“I’m Knock Señor,” said the man. “Point me to the car.”<br/></p><p>I think there’s been some mistake, I told him. I bought a knock <i>sensor</i>. He would hear none of it, endlessly repeating his demand to be led to the car that was throwing spurious knock codes ever since its little coil of ferrite bullshit had departed for the land of wind and ghosts. Eventually, I made like a politician’s office assistant and just gave in.</p><p>A few months ago, I had made a friend, but had failed to screen that friend well enough on the initial discussion. It turned out that not only did he own a Nissan, but that it was an XTerra, and not only that, but a supercharged XTerra. If you are unfamiliar, replacing the knock sensor on one of these is sort of like being a twenty-armed proctologist who works on a planet where every patient is entirely made of assholes filled with broken glass. I knew it was only a matter of time before the friendship was extended into “favours,” the indivisible currency that kept the world of shitty project cars possible.</p><p>Knock Señor took one look at the XTerra, and then began to climb on the bumper and reach into the open engine bay. I stared in disbelief as he slowly contorted his body, his joints snapping and popping as he deformed his limbs to tuck beneath the exhaust manifold and touch the old knock sensor. At last, he shut his eyes, and seemed to be at peace. After a few minutes of waiting, I decided I might as well just fire up the car.</p><p>No check engine light.</p><p>I will never understand why my friend never noticed that there was a five foot tall Mexican man wrapped around his engine block, but perhaps he just assumed it was a Nissan part number update of some kind. My gratitude to Knock Señor knows no bounds, and I sure hope he managed to pry himself out of that car before it went to the crusher a few weeks later.</p>

<p>There was definitely a virulent strain of Prelude Madness running around my neighbourhood, just as it did every spring, when the thoughts of young high school graduates turned to getting a free used car from their parents. The Prelude, it seemed, was the perfect car on paper for these horny teens: a “big-block” Honda engine, opulent comfort, and a trim coupe body that went on for days. Not to mention there were dozens of the basket cases out there, washed and waxed freshly by ancient mechanics prepared for the summer kill.</p><p>I remember when the kids in my auto shop began to show signs of Prelude Madness. It was April, and to be fair, a lot of these kids should have been spending their time at Remedial Trades Math instead of leafing through Craigslist and counting their meagre pot profits. Naturally, most kids wanted the bulky and comfortable fifth generation Prelude, opting for a plush leather interior and the vague hope that a newer car would somehow be less defective.</p><p>Believe me when I tell you that as their teacher, I felt it was important to give them some good-natured adult guidance. Get a third gen, I said, take care of it, get some of that 4WS action, it’s a future collector’s piece. Almost to a man, they rebelled: flip-up headlights were for doddering oldmos, the centre console had no cupholders in which to place their mobile telephones, and worst of all, the back seat was simply not big enough for manufacturing today’s larger teenage pregnancies. All good points, I told them: and yet I was secretly disappointed. Soon, I realized, these as-yet-bought Preludes would return to the streets as their owners bought SUVs the size of a one-bedroom apartment and demanded that the self-driving functionality usher their brood safely to and from the safe heroin injection clinic.</p><p>I never did convince those kids, but by peering over their shoulders and walking them through the pros and cons of each ad, I was able to scoop up quite a few fourth gens for my own. Not even a single one of my high school kids or their parents noticed that it was me, wearing a crude rubber mask of Ronald Reagan, who was the one selling them these Preludes at $1000 over the original price.</p><p>What can I say? I had to pay for the class shop supplies somehow.</p>

<p>If there was one problem with the old Cars &amp; Coffee, I mean other than the frequent bursts of nearly-unavoidable vehicular homicide, it was that the second part - Coffee - just was not emphasized enough. Plus, I had a few money problems because ARP head bolts aren’t free, so I put two and two together and struck an exclusive sponsorship deal with Starbucks.</p><p>All it took was convincing them that I actually represented the advertising agency that controlled NASCAR, and by the next week, Cars &amp; Coffee &amp; Coffee &amp; Coffee &amp; Coffee was off to a great start. I went around, admiring the hard-parked exotics, numbers-matching vintage muscle cars and never-driven pony cars, and drinking freely from my gratis pot of black joy. Sure, I could tell that the regular Starbucks clientele was beginning to get the DTs at having to wait an extra few minutes to wedge their baleen whales of a Lexus into the drive-through, but it was an overall pleasant experience.</p><p>The next week, things had gotten a little <i>weird</i>. Those Lexus-driving, yoga-pants-wearing, Instagram-obsessed, Daytimer-toting, prescription-painkiller-abusing regular customers? Well, they had figured out that now there was something more exclusive than the Starbucks Platinum Reserve Card, and they had worked out a plan between them and their accountants to <i>get it</i>. Yes indeed, the parking lot was now stuffed to the gills with a harem of jaw-droppingly desirable exotics, the owners having fled inside to hook their veins up to the IVs that would pump them full of burned beans and frothed-up milk.</p><p>Near the end of the morning, disaster struck. A Dark Roast-infused mother of two popped the clutch a little hard on her vintage RUF Yellowbird and took out half a dozen onlookers. Caffeine jitters aside, it seemed like a salvageable disaster until she leaned into the resulting oversteer and smoked a DeTomaso Mangusta owned by a local real estate agent, who at the moment was trying in vain to find a cupholder within the oh-so-Italian monster-engined penis replacement. The resulting hot coffee lawsuit made Starbucks more than a little jumpy about future sponsorship, and so C<sup>5</sup> was forced to look for yet another new venue, the search made all the harder by the harem of coffee-achievers that we were now towing in our retinue.</p><p>It was pure luck that I was able to land on another venue so quickly. Turns out the entire nation of Italy was looking for a place to dispose of both its excess supercars and its substantial trade deficit in coffee beans. The only downside is that the morning commute kind of sucked, but you go where you have to in order to see numbers-matching Volares.</p>

<p>My enemies in the media had done it again, had struck a blow by photographing me in the clutches of a young - far, far too young - model. It was the auto show, I explained to them, this sort of thing was expected here. You were <i>supposed</i> to do it, it was the culture, they left you no choice.</p><p>No logic would stop these jackals from publishing, and so, the next morning, I realized that my reputation had been destroyed a million times over, my shocked image peering out from the covers of all the supermarket tabloids. We were going to have to get in front of this, said my publicist, doing a hit of nitrous oxide hard enough to lift the bumper skyward for emphasis.</p><p>I had disappointed my fans many times over the last few years, but it always stung. This, I knew they had to be saying, was a betrayal worse than ever before. With a dry mouth, I leaned onto the podium and began my speech.</p><p>“Friends, family, thank you for your support in this trying time.” I found myself beginning to weep, and dabbed the edges of my eyes with a shop towel to keep the tears at bay. “These allegations which you have read in the newspapers are, unfortunately, true.”<br/></p><p>“I have sat in several <i>new</i> cars, at the auto show. But I did not accept sales brochures or freebies.”</p><p>I knew it could not be enough. How could they trust me again, having seen me trying out a seat that was new, without its bolsters crushed into a fine paste by a succession of lazy fat men sliding across them? Perhaps they were right, I thought to myself after. I <i>was</i> really impressed by the fact that those Hyundai Sonatas had heated rear seats.</p>

<p>Accuracy is an important thing in my discipline. You can’t take shortcuts, little “cheats,” or make sloppy work just because it’s Tuesday morning and you have a NyQuil hangover the size of the Goodyear blimp. People die when you don’t pay attention to the little details.</p><p>What? No, I’m not a doctor. I just go to the model train convention and yell at all the period-accurate dioramas whose cars are the wrong year.</p><p>Look at this one. You can clearly tell that this locomotive is a 1970-era CSX F-unit - just ask anyone here - so there’s no way they would have been running it on public roads as late as 1989, but this here is <i>clearly</i> a new-for-1990 HO-scale Colony Park wagon. See the little headrests on the front seats? Well, <i>somebody</i> didn’t.</p><p>Or how about this one? Who is driving a 1924 Model A to the local grocery store in this, the so-called 1968 “last of the steam locomotives” era? Anyone who daily drove one of these things in a climate like this would have thrown a small ziploc bag full of rust into the junkyard long before now. I’m choosing to give the benefit of the doubt on what is also clearly a Super Beetle down the street from it, because perhaps the owners are <i>time travelling hippies from ten years in the future</i>.</p><p>I don’t do this for money. I do this for the joy of knowing that I am right.</p>

<H1>Gift Ideas for Volvo Fans</H1>
<p>It’s that time of the year again: seasonally-appropriate gift-giving time. If you’ve got a Volvo fan in your life, you might be wondering: how can I get them a gift that both tells them I’m cool with their problem, and also that I would like them to stay as far away from me as possible?</p><p>Check out this list of valuable gifts that your average Volvo owner would enjoy.</p>
<ul><li>Iron-on elbow patches for their tweed jackets</li>
  <li>A replacement PCV system for whatever car they&rsquo;re driving (whatever it is, it needs a PCV)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Macpherson Struts Anonymous&rdquo; membership</li>
  <li>Monthly subscription to new motor mounts</li>
  <li>Wrist-altering surgery to allow them to service heater cores</li>
  <li>Miniature Swedish flags and honorary &ldquo;Swede Name&rdquo; (available from Swedish embassies, name is legally binding)</li>
  <li>Automotive primary wire and wiring harness connectors</li>
  <li>Mustache wax</li>
  <li>The entrails of a Saab driver, can be consumed for +5HP</li>
  <li>Tenure</li>
</ul><p>Remember, Christmas is a dangerous time for safety-minded Volvo owners. The increased traffic on the roads is likely to make them more paranoid than usual, so it&rsquo;s best to not make eye contact while leaving a gift for them.</p>

<p>“Welcome to El Meat Hose,” shrieked the waitress before an incoming stream of donair slaw forced her to hit the deck. All I could do was chuckle. Even with the waste of meat caused by a server’s poor aim, the splash of edible gore against the wipe-clean walls of the restaurant sounded like a cash register dinging to me.<br/></p><p>In consultations with the Middle American Trade Envoys after the war, we determined that the most expedient way to service their food needs was to simply give them what they wanted. After a quick competition sponsored by DARPA with the smartest college-age minds of the coasts, our government had revolutionized welfare with a new program. This program was the All You Can Eat restaurant to end them all, El Meat Hose.</p><p>The model was simple. Imagine you and your midwestern family need somewhere to eat, but you don’t particularly want to learn Mandarin or even Cantonese to do it. Get in the 4Runner and drive the entire fam over to El Meat Hose. After slipping on your backsplash-protection bib (with trauma plate) and OSHA-mandated eye protection, a server clad in head-to-toe biohazard gear will patrol the tables, spraying high-velocity meat slurry into your open mouth. When you’re done with your flavour experience, just get up and leave. No need to fill out any complicated forms or pay us: we just automatically debit it from your implanted Protection Of The Underclass microchip, which is means-tested 600 times per second to ensure you still qualify for benefits.</p><p>It is a credit to the benevolence of the Post-American Outer Empire States that they would bestow upon their former enemies such glory. Even General Sherman would acknowledge that the steak hose is a pretty tasty way to get your calories. And it’s created jobs, too: some of our greatest Midwest minds are now employed as meat compression technologists, because it’s super hard to put 600 bar of pressure behind a pork chop efficiently.</p>

<p>A thing that almost nobody knows about General Motors’ ill-fated transition to metric platforms is that, rather than, read an engineering manual or send their management away to visit Sweden, they decided to consult with a psychic. That’s right, world-famous psychic Esmerelda Swain was the primary consultant on the GM metrication project, and her legendary appetite for small-bore V8s is why the G-body is considered, even today, to be the peak of General Motors product.</p><p>Back in 1979, when rabblerousers suspected that there might one day be a need to measure things smaller than three-eights of an inch, Pontiac management got involved with a series of corporate-wide discussions about the impending horrorshow that would soon be upon the greater North American Co-Prosperity Sphere. It was undeniable: corporate re-training was necessary, and it should start at their product planning division. As it so happened, the Pontiac head of project development at the time saw himself as sort of a part-time mystic and conjurer, and after he revealed this fact and failed multiple times to pull a rabbit out of his hat on demand, outsourced the entire job to Ms. Swain.</p><p>Esmerelda Swain nailed it. Out of the gate, her first couple of meetings with GM management expressed the need to arbitrarily and inconsistently mix imperial and metric fasteners, so as to make the customer more dependent on the benevolence of their corporate overlords. In her proposal, anyone who owned a Pontiac would be forced to return to the dealership every five minutes, in order to figure out whether a given fastener was “all that important” after all.</p><p>The plan would never work without GM’s partners in industry. Acting swiftly, the then-president of Chevrolet worked to ensure that no parts stores would ever stock an adequate amount of metric bolts, insisting well into the 21st century that the enormous piles of unsold SAE fasteners that no longer fit the vast majority of cars made were perfectly adequate to satisfy the automotive aftermarket.</p><p>GM’s participation in the conspiracy, while offensive to the Carter government, proved prescient in that it allowed them to leapfrog Ford, gaining the rare honour of the SAE’s “Worst Fucking Designed Car” award back-to-back. This streak lasted until the introduction of the Maserati Biturbo in 1981, in which a desperate group of Italians aiming to regain their crown as the world’s worst engineers risked the entire company on a cocktail napkin drawing done by a heroin-addicted intern. One imagines that if the Italians hadn’t run Ms. Swain, the former CEO of Ducati, out of their country during an ill-planned purge of mystics and Romas, they would have never lost the crown in the first place.</p>

<p>“You guys wanna do some crimes?” asked Paul Runner, the Federal agent who had infiltrated our street-racing gang in an attempt to entrap us. It seemed like he was the only one unaware of his incompetence, a theory which was gaining more weight by the second.<br/></p><p>It was the early 00s, and a young Lisa Kubo had struck a blow for front-wheel-drive rights everywhere. Motorists at parties said the words “low-end torque” in public with no apparent sense of shame. DVD players were stolen en masse by squadrons of roving EG Civics terrorizing the highway. Our gang was up to no good, sure, but it wasn’t cheap to keep our fine rides in Skunk2 rear swaybar mounts and new ignition cylinders.</p><p>“What?” replied the leader of our gang, Vincent Petroleum, as he injected a dram of crushed legal prescription painkiller.<br/></p><p>Now, you may ask yourself, why did we keep Paul around if it was so obvious that his only reason for being here was putting us in prison? Well, with the enormous resources of the federal government at his beck and call, it was also obvious that he was the only human being within 200 miles of our place that could afford to keep a modified Mitsubishi Eclipse running &ndash; and we hung out right beside the Mitsubishi factory.</p>

<p>I’ll never forget what it was like when the Swedish engineering exchange came to my humble little corner office on the outer rim of the sprawling General Motors empire. They had so many clever insights in optimizing our business, such as “who are you?” and “how did you get past security?” Ah, that was Per, though - such a cut-up. It was hard to ignore his moxie as I led him into a featureless broom closet, which I then locked him and his fellow Scandinavian Scooby Doo gang within.</p><p>Years ago, I first broke into this GM satellite office when it was meant for Opels. The complete lack of sales, new products, or even vague interest in the product lineup provided me with a safe place to sleep and plenty of office supplies to sell on eBay, and I thought that even as the office traded hands to Saab, there would, if anything, be even less interest in what it was that I was doing. I hadn’t counted on anyone actually giving a shit, and so I had been caught off guard.<br/></p><p>Thing was, I had to still make it look like I was doing the work of all those Swedes despite having incapacitated them. Cursing their legendary Northern European work ethic, I copied and pasted some shit from the Vauxhall catalogue into a new document. It wasn’t until a few minutes after the plans for the new Saabs had been sent off to manufacturing that I realized I could probably have ransomed some good car ideas out of them in exchange for tap water and vending machine food - with how efficiently a Swede ran, it’s likely that they could have survived a full year on just one snack-size bag of high-calorie pork rinds.</p><p>The next week, GM management proudly took the stage to announce the new lineup of Saab 900s. That little plan I had bodged together quickly while listening for indications that the engineers had began chewing their way through the door had all the words they liked: “partsbin,” “technology sharing,” “ass to mouth.” It was such a hit at the show that nobody asked any questions, and certainly they couldn’t shut down the little office-park shithole that I lived in.</p><p>When I returned to said shithole, I received my comeuppance. On my desk sat a piece of paper with Official Letterhead. It seemed that, for my genius in innovation and liaising with the Swedes (who I was pretty sure were still alive), I was going to be dispatched to Germany, to take care of the Opel Problem once and for all.</p><p>Even now, as I write this by what little fluorescent light can be reflected through the cracks beneath the highly-efficient Frankfurt broom closet door, I regret nothing, except maybe the alternator placement on the NG900.</p>

<p>“You have to help us,” wailed the metamind at the centre of the internet. “We have built a simple time machine, and you must go back in time to save our beloved retail brands!”</p><p>Soon, I was standing outside a Circuit City on the outskirts of San Diego. It was particularly strange to me to be in the Beforetimes, able to simply walk into a retail store and pay ridiculous amounts of money for a confusing yet still limited array of products. Within the store, miserable employees wore Christmas-themed flair and taught customers about the basics of the World Wide Web.</p><p>My blood ran cold, recognizing the start of the chain that would soon lead to their demise, retail shoppers hiding in bombed-out big box stores, cowering with every whooping pass of the Amazon hunter-killer drones, still seeking one of the few customers with whom they had not yet built a recommendation profile. I had to stop these rubes from getting on the Internet, but the time machine didn’t let me bring the small-caliber hand gun I had 3D printed that morning(?), declaring it a future item that would cause a time paradox. I had to dig into my closet for hours in order to find clothes that would please it, finally settling on a traditional Hypercolor t-shirt, the official uniform of the time period. Instead of a firearm, I was going to have to use my brains to get through this.</p><p>After pulling the fire alarm near the womens’ washroom, I had soon cleared out the entire store. Rows upon rows of Gateways and Packard Bells played their screensavers on endless loop, no longer able to seduce Middle America into the purchasing cycle that would one day lead to the death of so many proud brands. Such an action, drastic as it was, was only a temporary solution. Soon, the fire department would appear, and high on their adequate level of funding through taxes, would declare the store safe and ready for customers to return and resume their shopping. I had to go to the source.</p><p>In the parking lot, I walked past row after row of delectable new early-90s economy cars. It was hard to take my eyes off the rust-free Taurus wagons, minty Mazda 323s and pristine pre-rice Civics, but I knew that this was not my own time and to avail myself of these brand experiences would be ultimately fruitless.</p><p>Squaring up a Civic in the corner of the lot that wasn’t covered by streetlights, I reached into my pocket to consult the Wikipedia page on hotwiring. Soon, I experienced the familiar sensation of panic that my phone had gone missing, before remembering that the time machine, too, had not allowed me to bring my humble always-connected, ultra-futuristic pocket supercomputer with me. I decided to play it by ear, hoping that the car was relatively unloved by its owner, and that the local mall cops would ignore a white man who was acting erratically in public.</p><p>With a quick twist of the made-in-America flathead screwdriver I bought from the Fry’s down the street, the Civic leapt to life. I pointed it towards Seattle, and began breathing exercises to focus myself for the upcoming battle with Sir Jeff Bezos, future President-Dictator for life.</p>

<p>General Atomics and Qdoba are proud to announce their new joint effort: the TQ-2 “Big Taquito” airborne burrito delivery service. Now newly certified for civilian use in NATO territories, the TQ-2 can fly for up to eighteen hours per sortie at the FAA-approved maximum height of ten thousand feet. This allows the product to satisfy even the longest lunch rushes with extreme prejudice.</p><p>Large crowds do not deter the TQ-2: with its twin belt-fed 110mm burrito launchers, the TQ-2 is capable of saturating up to a 200 x 200 meter area of hungry customers at an effective firing rate of one hundred burritos per minute. No longer will festivals, parades, Middle Eastern weddings and other large gatherings go without burritos. Additional mission outfit kits are available to equip the hardpoints of the TQ-2 with alternate wrapped foods, including the popular falafel and soft taco munitions (kebab expected to be available Q4 2018).</p><p>All customers are automatically identified using a combination of gait recognition and long-distance Bluetooth antennas. Their Apple Pay or Google Wallet mobile payment accounts are automatically debited at the moment of burrito launch, and the high-end Zeiss optics and sensor radome of the TQ-2 can accurately place a burrito into the hands of the customer from its maximum operating height at a precision of ten millimeters.</p><p>General Atomics and Qdoba: we brought the fight against hunger home.</p>

<p>They say nothing is as difficult as removing a Subaru ball joint, but the brain surgeon that I met at the elementary school’s Work Week speeches said otherwise. He had a very impressive PowerPoint deck, it was true, but a lot of the kids didn’t really care for the gorier details. It was about halfway through the slides that I began to feel that there may be some kind of point that he was getting at.</p><p>After the fifth or sixth gory traffic-accident shot, I decided it was probably a good idea to speak up.</p><p>“Are you paid flat-rate or by the hour?” I asked.<br/></p><p>Mr. Bigpants Surgeon wheeled around on his heel, and looked at me now instead of the 1080p image of an open-skull subdural hematoma. His questioning gaze told me all I needed to know.

<p>I’ve told the World Health Organization about this many times, but I and my intrepid team of epidemiologists have discovered that a lack of exposure to Fox bodies is invariably fatal. You cannot deny the data: statistics clearly show that the average life expectancy went up sharply upon the humble Fox body’s introduction, and climbed all throughout its tempestuous lifecycle.</p><p>Now that even the newest of these cars were sloughing into the junkyard, it seemed likely that soon people all across the world would become unhealthy again. Something had to be done. You can’t wait around for the government, however, and so I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p><p>I decided to make a cross-country trip, and it was not at all an excuse to purchase that low-mileage, kinda-rusty 1988 Cougar that I saw on Craigslist. In every small town, every port, and every parking garage, I left a savage stream of smoking rubber behind, in both straight and doughnut formats. The people were overjoyed to see it, harkening back to a simpler time when a young man’s fancy turned to Mustangs rather than just sharing pictures of cross-burning frogs on the Internet. With my right foot and the wobbly chassis alone, I was setting things right again.</p><p>Things went wrong for the first time in Newark. I got into a fist-fight with the gas station operator who refused to let me pump my own gas. I was sickened by this un-American crime against nature, and the mission of my quest subtly shifted. Soon, I had been called before the New Jersey state legislature, in order to show them that an average man was indeed capable of pumping his own gas.</p><p>I’m not going to apologize for what happened next, because it wasn’t my fault. Those old Fox fuel fillers just wear out the shitty rubber tank gasket so fast, and when you’re distracted by answering the questions of politicians, it’s easy to miss the fact that you are pouring high-test directly onto their beautiful rug before popping a burnie and kicking off a roaring fire that consumes the entire state legislature.</p>

<p>It might seem paranoid, but I am now convinced more than ever that the Princess Auto weekly circular contains a secret code that tells of the Real Deals. I have dedicated my life to decrypting this complex puzzle, and it is only in the last few weeks that I have made major progress, thanks to my connections at the university supercomputer laboratory and enough Japanese convenience-store methamphetamine to stop the heart of an elephant.</p><p>Years ago, there was a dragway here. My friends and I would pop burnies in the water box and then, at the bidding of The Christmas Tree, pop that clutch and embark upon a spiritual journey to understand the true nature of speed. Now, that track had been lost, and with it any hope of understanding my place in the universe. That dragway was deconstructed into gravel by a conspiracy of corrupt city politicians and the unyielding thirst of homebuilders buzzing like hummingbirds to the flowers of just-one-more-deal Hail Marys to avoid the insolvency they brought down upon themselves.</p><p>Now, a Princess Auto sat calmly beside where the dragway once dominated. That humble store was still able to keep its head above water even after the loss of wild-eyed psychos raiding their hydraulic fittings aisle to construct last minute ghetto-fabricated manual boost controllers in the pits before tech. I was convinced that this was the Princess Auto that had sent me those encrypted circulars, that some force within it bid me welcome, to accept me into the weird hardware/surplus store family. If I could not have speed, I thought, at least I could have a well-developed understanding of the Chinese scrap-to-cheap-shit pipeline.</p><p>Someone had told them to expect me, I realized, as all eyes in the store turned to focus on my twin-turbocharged Buick Reatta, its Holset turbos pushing wailing furies of discarded boost through the screamer pipes mounted on each side. At first, I had thought it was simply the fact that, as in other places, I had the weirdest car around, but then I remembered that the average Princess Auto parking lot is ninety five percent Japanese imports by volume, their pilots so far gone that they were no longer even aware of the concept that what they drove was weird. It was inarguable: someone within had been waiting for the Reatta specifically.</p><p>I had barely entered the store when one of the associates stopped me.</p><p>“Mr. Switch,” he said, a shit-eating grin on his face, “Congratulations on being today’s Special Customer! Here is a $20 gift card.”<br/></p><p>As I reached out for the card, everything became fuzzy for me. I awoke hours later, long after the store had closed. I realized that I was sitting in the Reatta, which was now stuffed to the gills with thousands of dollars in cheap tools that I did not particularly need. Those fuckers had done it to me <i>again</i>.</p>

<p>Near as I can tell, there’s always one sure-fire way to get to Valhalla, and that’s wreckin’ a Nissan Altima. They even kind of rhyme, that’s how ingrained it was in the knowledge of our distant ancestors. Those ancestors struggled for a better life, knowing with every brick piled upon bloody brick that they were developing a society that was capable of building tools to one day destroy the indigenous population of wild Altimas roaming the prairie.</p><p>Nowadays, we’ve lost a lot of that knowledge. Nissan Altimas just show up. Sometimes the Nissan dealer just turns around, sells ‘em to some sucker who walks in the door and wants a big stereo and front wheel drive “for the snow” but doesn’t really understand all that rap about interest rates. You know the kind.</p><p>I know that my entry into the afterlife is sealed and that I will be fed peeled grapes and sup of rivers of fine beer, for I once worked at Pick N Pull for a couple weeks until I got fired for stealing R134a to sell on the black market. Every time I pushed the button to slam the crusher down on another Altima, I could feel my ancestors smiling down upon me. Who says there’s no religion in America?</p>

<p>Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of man? Robert McNamara knew, and that’s why he tried to steer us away from temptation with the pudgy-yet-comforting, utilitarian body of the Ford Falcon. Only there in its Corn Flakes anti-opulence would the American people be able to find perfectly efficient commuting nirvana. He was sure of it.</p><p>Imagine his rage when he came into his office at Ford and saw Lee Iacocca there, twirling a fork into a plate of cocaine-dusted spaghetti from the cafeteria, his usual breakfast (or at least the solid component thereof). Sorry Bob, but the Italian Stallion’s got something fast up his sleeve: an exciting new miniature grand tourer named the Mustang!</p><p>They say he died from old age, but I know better - McNamara decided to check out as soon as he realized that Iacocca’s pony car was nothing better than a common pedestrian mulcher, worse for the American people than any number of disastrous land wars in Asia. In honour of Robert McNamara, all of us car guys should take a moment and make sure that all of our corkboards have outlines of our tools drawn on them. It’s what he would have wanted.</p>

<p>It’s strange how little it takes to change your destiny. Just five steps to the left at a critical moment and everything would turn out completely differently. This concept was on my mind recently, as I watched the mayor miss his cue and get run over by the Girl Scouts’ disability-awareness-themed float during the Thanksgiving Parade.</p><p>The real bitch of it all is that the float was a real pretty princess, before it ended up in the police impound, the blood and hair tacked onto its undercarriage: a pristine 1993 turbodiesel GMC full-ton dually, with a stick, in Spruce Metallic. I could scarcely believe Mary Chofferson’s luck in having scored such a primo deal from Craigslist, but all she would tell me (in her usual cryptic manner) was that it was a “family deal.” During the course of the police investigation, however, I would find out exactly just how much of a “family deal” what had happened was.</p><p>We were all shocked when Mary and her husband were arrested in the cul-de-sac out front of the elementary school, the tactical team captain forcing the muzzle of his 5.56mm carbine against Mary’s cheek as he told her to bite the pavement. Gossip gets around in our little suburban enclave, and soon we had the full story.</p><p>Old Mayor Cuthbert had turned down the PTA Mafia’s friendly offer of being allowed to exclusively control the hot chocolate distribution at the Thanksgiving Parade, perhaps thinking it was some kind of trifle that could be safely ignored. Old Mayor Cuthbert hadn’t grown up with Mary, like I had. He hadn’t visited her in the hospital for moral support, seen her father lying stricken in the operating theatre, high-caliber slugs being pulled out of his body, hooked up to a million bleeping machines with his emotionless daughter looking on. Cuthbert hadn’t helped Mary throw away the gun, into the old creek behind the Kay Bee Toys.<br/></p><p>When the court case was over, I visited Mary, for moral support, in prison. An ordeal such as this would take its toll on any couple, especially when your dupe of a husband was himself also in the men’s prison next door. Mary didn’t seem bothered, though. What did bother her is when I asked her if she had a service history for the ‘93 GMC I just won at police auction.</p>

<p>Never let it be said that I was ignorant of the dire threat that climate change posed to all humanity. Also, though, I really liked not having to pay a whole lot of money for gas.</p><p>At first, the members of the He-Man Battery-Haters Club told me that I was a lunatic, that my prototype sail-based Honda CRX HF would never work. Then, the tornadoes came. Soon, if I timed my merge right, I could get from zero to sixty in under four seconds - that’s nineties supercar territory. Stopping without any access to engine vacuum took a finely metered lead foot, but it was still possible most times to haul the plastic masterpiece down from lethal speeds without having to take an amateur course in roadside gardening at the School of Hard Knocks.</p><p>As the tornadoes increased in ferocity and vegetation began to tear itself loose from the very earth in windswept erosionfests, I found myself getting even faster. This was important as the rolling terrorstorms were now much harder to evade as they raked the American midwest with kilometer-wide forks of boiling lightning. With the gale force winds at my back, I completed a trip from border to border in just a few hours, relying on what was left of the ionosphere to warn my Instagram followers to install a massive kinetic-arrest catch net outside the Congressional building in Washington DC, where I would land and then immediately give a speech about alternative fuel sources.</p><p>It was not to last forever. On my way back from my trip to Washington, I thoughtlessly turned the CRX into an underground parking garage to keep it from getting stolen and snapped the sail mast right off at the roof line. As the garage filled with desert sand thrown into it by the wailing winds, I abandoned the Honda and made my way aboveground, hoping that the local warlords would have a traditional fuel vehicle that still had intact window glass I could ride back in.</p>

<p>I’d been working on plane engines for so long that I didn’t know if I was Lycoming or going. Just a little aerospace humour there, ha ha. The thing about plane engines is that you need to be paying attention. Your customer can’t really roll to a stop on I-95 and schlep to the ol’ Circle K to call for a tow truck. They just don’t really have time to visit convenience stores what with the fiery gravity-assisted death they are currently embarking upon.</p><p>With that in mind, I was always focused in the shop when I was banging together an experimental airplane engine. The fact that I would never get into any plane that I had built the engine for didn’t seem to bother the flyboys that bought them from me, but honestly I’m not sure how many more danger indicators I could have flashed in their face that they actually would have keyed onto. “Spitting in the face of God” is basically the Objective line on their CVs, if you get my drift.</p><p>One morning, I was meeting a very well-heeled client at his private hanger to drop off a fresh engine and pick up a decent core. I felt extremely flush with cash, and it was Spring - the season when a red-blooded male’s thoughts turn to project cars. It was a terrible combination, because the airport runway was almost devoid of tasty eighties metal over which to spread my wings. That’s when I saw it.</p><p>At the end of the runway, a small charter airline’s decrepit ‘88 Ford F250 came wheezing out from their hangar. Behind it, in a cloud of International 7.2 diesel smoke, was towed the snack cart. I was interested, but it was going to take a lot more than that to close the deal. After I did my business, I walked over, a grip of fifties in my left hand in the archetypal gunslinger pose.</p><p>Weeks later, I had finally gotten out of the airplane racket. Now, I enjoyed life serving novelty airplane snacks to hungry mechanics at the junkyard who had become tired of delectable junkyard tacos day after day. It was just as well, too: a few of my former clients tried to collect on their engine warranty by falling out of the sky onto my garage.</p>

<p>This whole country used to be awash in Tonka trucks, son. Every backyard, every childhood sandbox, every college campus was bustling with yellow-metalled, plastic-tired dump trucks and steam shovels and cement mixers beloved by children. Now, as the North American way of life dies, the humble Tonka truck has been replaced by opulent Power Wheels for the one-percent and nine-millimeter handguns with low-grain hot-loaded wadcutters for everyone else.</p><p>Thing is, in my modern-day meetings with the Tonka people, they were not willing to build me a full-scale daily-driver that could withstand being stepped on by an elephant, or door-dinged in the parking lot outside the Save-A-Buck Foods. I was just going to have to go to the source. Our indigenous predecessors used every part of the Tonka truck, you know, and so would I.</p><p>Figuring out the initial methodology to dismantle the little dump trucks for their invulnerable panels was difficult. No machine shop had a carbide bit that could even scratch the reams of yard-sale toys I dropped off on their doorsteps, and I thought all was lost until I made contact with a particularly troublesome materials engineer who had been barred from the reputable journals and conferences for his heretical ideas.</p><p>“Is this gonna work?” I raised my voice to be heard over the sound of the two-stage multi-megawatt hydrogen-fluoride chemical laser warming up.<br/></p><p>“I’m going to be honest with you,” yelled Ted BadIdeas, “I think paintless dent repair is a lot cheaper than this.”<br/></p>

<p>Mail-in contests are a lot like marriage: you write your personal information down on a piece of paper enough times, eventually you get a winner. Thing was, I had entered so many contests I didn’t really keep track of what it was I won, so when I showed up, I was a little surprised.</p><p>The first clue that something was up was that I had been formally invited to a “nice” part of town, somewhere you can park without worrying about some asshole stealing your wheels in a parking lot, or draining your oil to do a change on his car. As I circled the dealership lot, looking for a place that would be out of sight of the parts desk guy - knowing full well that it was futile, for all parts desk guys circulated my photo to warn them of my seven-palm negotiation techniques - I made a mental note of which cars seemed to have the freshest oil.</p><p>When I got to the dealership, I was shocked. Everyone from the dealer rushed out, happy to see me. Some part of me dropped to automatic survival instinct, and it wasn’t until after I had climbed the admin assistant’s desk and kicked over the cappuccino machine for cover that I was able to calm down enough to realize what the salesmen were telling me. I had won a car, they said. A Lamborghini Gallardo, they said.</p><p>Out back, they led me to what I assumed was a very nice used car. It was in fact a bright-green wedge of future bullshit which I was scarcely able to understand. Despite my shock, I was still able to produce a bill of sale form from the tear-off sheet I carried in my pocket, and made a reasonable facsimile of the VIN. We were ready to go. I climbed into the car, and tried to turn the key.</p><p>In a panic, I realized there was no place to put a key, and in fact the key they had given me was some kind of useless plastic fob. This was a <i>trap</i>. The other dealerships had put them up to it, made some kind of fake car that looked just real enough to convince me it was the real thing. I began to panic, clawing at the doors, screaming into the sealed windows, devoid of worn weatherstripping. A cold wind blew in my face. <i>Functional air conditioning</i>, I shrieked before passing out in terror.</p><p>After they had awoken me and towed the car back to my home garage, I realized what an ass I had made of myself. It was just a normal car, surely, with normal features. I climbed back within the Lambo and read the owner’s manual closely with my rudimentary service-manual Italian. There was just one problem.</p><p>What was an “automatic transmission?”</p>

<p>They call me Doctor Yellow’s Doctor. My job is to repair the Shinkansen trains when they break down. Because of a paperwork mixup in the bureaucracy, I am the only mechanic on duty in the entire bullet train network, but on the other hand I get paid the entire maintenance budget every year. This is the story of a fateful autumn day when my entire world changed forever.</p><p>I pulled up to the maintenance depot in my solid gold Jaguar ultralimo, admiring the frost forming on the sodium lamps from the early morning dew. This morning was to be a relatively easy set of wrench-turnings: brush replacements, drink cart re-casterings and the like. Any plan I had for the morning went straight out the window when my holographic personal assistant spontaneously activated and told me there was a priority interrupt request from Central Control. Frowning, I decided it was best to just let myself go limp and let it happen. They (and I mean They with a capital T) really didn’t like it when you tried to shake them off mid-torque.</p><p>“As you may know, we have been experimenting with a sentient Doctor Yellow in order to promote harmony and well-being on the Shinkansen Utopia Line,” spoke the service operator, no doubt reading off of an email that was just out of the reach of the holocams. “At 0301 hours, the first sentient Doctor Yellow achieved his Ph.D, just as he was expected. However, the doctorate turned out to have been in Heian Era poetry, and the JR Shinkansen line is now occupied by a three hundred ton liberal arts major who is obsessed with Tang dynasty waka.”</p><p>I grumbled. This kind of thing happened more often than you’d think, what with the recent declaration by the United Nations Intangible Cultural Heritage department that modern-day Japan was a fractally inscrutable land of magical realism. Those eggheads up there in the Tower were going to need me to take care of the problem, and to do so before the first set of bleary-eyed salesmen began their commute out of the KYB sales office to flip a set of GR2s into someone who drove their Suzuki Hustler a little hard.</p><p>When the monofilament capture net bit into the carapace of Doctor Doctor Yellow at three hundred and thirty kilometers per hour, and I heard the first scrambled noises of pain scream out of his neutral matrix into the audible spectrum, I wept a tear. But just one. I was a very busy mechanic, you see.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this,” said my family doctor in between bites of jalapeno beef jerky and swigs from a can of Asahi Super Dry, “but your blood has been replaced entirely with high-octane avgas.”</p><p>It didn’t really concern me too much until I got a call from OPEC while I was walking to my car. Turns out, I’m one of the largest oil-producing nations, by capita, and they were willing to back my attempt to gain independence from the Big Government monsters who had kept me oppressed for all this time. A few hours later, I was bumping knuckleballs of cocaine off the dash of an Aston Martin that was being driven very quickly towards the United Nations headquarters by a man who introduced myself as my new attorney.</p><p>No sooner had we arrived at the United Nations, than another man appeared and told me I was his attorney. I was not to trust the first guy, he said. He was an impostor, sent by the CIA to undermine my fledgling nation’s sovereignty. That was definitely a lot to think about, so instead of thinking too hard I just asked him what he drove here and if it was cooler than an Aston Martin.</p><p>Normally, an attorney that drives a 1997 Camry is not one you would want to listen to, but in my defence the dude had a V6 <i>and a five-speed</i>. I was thinking about that five-speed even as the CIA sent their goons into my Presidential Palace and hooked me up to the blood-stealing machine. They may also have been debt collectors, who wanted the money they had loaned me to buy said Palace, and were now justifiably angry that I am too afraid of needles to extract my own blood for oil.</p>

<p>Back in the bad old days, I was a country music writer of some reknown. It’s a little-known but somehow still widely accepted fact that country music stars cannot actually write their own music. It’s not illiteracy: they are simply too busy crossing the country on tour, racking up the miles. Miles that I wasn’t accomplishing, stuck in my damp rowhouse, out of both synthetic heroin and natural ethanol, slowly going mad from writers’ block.</p><p>I met with an old friend, Frank, at the bar. In times like these, it was best to at least meet with a few people, so that you could establish a timeline that would give the cops who would find your bloated corpse in the dripping emergency stairwell of your place the satisfaction of closure. He was going through a divorce at the time, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I thought I could milk some of his misery to get a couple ideas on the plate.</p><p>“I can’t believe my wife got the Intrepid,” he whined. “I really wanted to see how many more kilometers it could do.”<br/></p><p>It turned out that his leaky-faced cloud car had accomplished an already quite impressive 434,000 km, which was nearly unheard of for a car which society widely considered to be a crap heap. We argued about the reasons why it could have lasted so long, but decided in the end it was a tragedy that he wouldn’t get to see the crap-badge he had been limping along all this time finally die.</p><p>Stumbling across the parking lot that separated the bar from my apartment building, I realized that I had my hit. <i>Bitch Ain’t Doing The Oil Changes At Manufacturer Recommended Intervals For Severe Service</i> went right to the top of the Country Top 40 that month, and never left. Even today, decades later, we see no chance of it ever being replaced by a sadder tale of white North American woe.</p><p>That Intrepid? It&rsquo;s also still going. The last time Frank and I checked, the shaman assured us that it was possessed by a malevolent spirit, from a realm not our own. Also, her new husband was taking it as a bit of a personal challenge to see if he could make the odo roll completely over.</p>

<p>Tonight on the <i>Real Housewives of Malibu</i>: we meet a 1979 Chevrolet Malibu “Classic,” and his wife, Brigadine. They are celebrating their tenth wedding anniversary this upcoming March.</p><p>Their marriage is almost perfect, but there is one problem: she says he has a wandering passenger-side headlight, due to a broken adjuster. We’re here to fix it. Meet registered couples therapist Clancy Moonhumper, who drove down from Boston just this morning in her nitro-chugging 1976 Plymouth Scamp.</p><p>At about the same age, these two once-common economy cars have many shared interests, and it seems that the Malibu and the Scamp are off to a quick if superficial male friendship. They’re not here to make friends, though. Already, Clancy has unrolled her pile of tools and selected the exact correct metric spanner to correct the Malibu’s unfortunate predilection towards blinding oncoming traffic.</p><p>Brigadine is overjoyed that her husband is now safely compliant with both the federal and state highway lighting code, and to celebrate she plans to surprise him with 10W40 cocktails on the beach where she first negotiated to purchase him from police auction. Clancy returns home, pleased that she was able to make a difference in the life of another proud carfucker.</p>

<p>Everyone likes something maybe more than they should. It’s in our nature to be tribal, to want to gut “the other side,” to get one over on them and laugh smugly at their terrible nature. This kind of polarization has been growing for decades, and the poison within threatened to tear apart the peace in my idyllic suburbanite life.</p><p>I refer, of course, to the Honda vs. Toyota fanboy wars.</p><p>For my own part - full disclosure - I was more of a Honda guy. I like my engines peaky, eager, and I like my interiors simple and well-packaged. My friend, or at least he used to be my friend, preferred Toyotas, possibly because of some kind of birth defect or early childhood trauma. He said his 1995 Corolla Plus was much less ostentatious than my flashy 1992 Accord LX, and therefore contained more inherent merit. No amount of drag races would convince him otherwise, so it was off to a place I was familiar with: Beater Court.</p><p>Ever since I had been jumped into the Beater Community with the blessing of a series of well-meaning if eternally drunken high school auto shop teachers, there had always been Beater Court. If you had a dispute with some guy who borrowed your Tercel, nuked the motor on unregulated dry shots of nitrous, and didn’t come back with a replacement junkyard mill, you took his ass to Court. Yet, not every dispute before them came down to simple cheap-assery and equipment breakage. Some cases, such as mine, came down to setting a precedent.</p><p>The early days of the trial were pretty ordinary. We went before the jury of our peers, presented our arguments for the superiority of our own sides, and then arranged for a succession of expert witnesses to take the stand. I had badly miscalculated my own so-called “expert,” and on the fourth day of the trial both me and my friend would lose.</p><p>“You know who makes a good car?” drunkenly slurred the overall-clad technician that I had lured into my car at the local modified-car meet. “<i>Fiat</i> makes a good car!”</p><p>I ducked behind a chair as the courtroom erupted into violence. Both the jury bench and the audience leapt to their feet, and began hurling improvised weapons - a timing chain here, an old water pump there - both at one another and also at the man who would later come to be named the Italian Interloper.</p><p>In retrospect, it should have been no surprise. I had lured this so-called “expert” off the street before realizing he was in fact a bodyshop technician, and would prefer whatever brand of vehicle rusted enough to keep him in high-octane electronics cleaning spirits and methamphetamine.</p>

<p>We thought we were gods. There was nothing we couldn’t achieve, no tire size we couldn’t fit. Mad with thirst for the look we wanted, we spent a small country’s GDP on fibreglass, Bondo and stolen election signs. There was just no limit to how big we wanted our box flares to be.</p><p>One morning, as I sat in the dim haze of dawn’s light filtering through the windows of the garage mahal, the idea which led to the end of all came to me. I had plenty of experience dealing with bad ideas, for I had those pretty much hourly. Yet, this idea seemed perfectly reasonable - it was a good concept, it was achievable, and I could pull it off within a few hours to see if I liked it.</p><p>I bolted one set of flares onto <i>another set</i> of flares.</p><p>Stepping back, I gasped with delight. My work was perfect, ideal, the peak of human achievement, dare I say. Now, though, there was a flaw in my otherwise perfect car. The tires were no longer flush - they were simply too narrow to deal with these doubleflares. My pulse began to race, and I became short of breath, the pressure on my chest not alleviating until the tire shop at last picked up their phone.</p><p>Soon, I had filled in the fenders with a set of tires so wide it took several minutes to walk to the drivers’ door. There was something wrong, though, some problem lying just out of my mental reach. It wasn’t until I reached the drivers’ seat that it became obvious to me.</p><p>I bolted a <i>third</i> set of flares onto the car.</p>

<p>Bob Mazda wanted me to pass the maple syrup. It was the closest thing to an apology he would muster, I figured. I passed it. He went back to intently staring at a point just behind my right ear on the faux woodgrain wall of our booth at Denny’s.</p><p>Faithful readers may remember the time when Bob Mazda, the CEO of Mazda, attempted to have me killed for exposing the secret RX7 scam. Mazda was building hundreds, no, thousands of super-advanced new-generation RX7s per day, only to immediately feed them into a roaring steel crucible. At the time, I didn’t understand why. That’s why I went back to Japan, except this time in my secret alter-ego as mild-mannered automotive journalist Dominic Toretto.</p><p>The thing about Japan? Motherfuckers <i>love</i> Denny’s. It’s like some kind of confusing fetish pornography, borne out of a hellish nuclear apocalypse and forced adoption into the American way of life. None of these people had learned from their ancestors how to behave in Denny’s. Instead, imported television, hacked to death in a thousand ways to fit a shortened episode runtime or a confusing maze of censorship rules, was their only guide to the magic that dwelled within these peeling walls of yellow imitation Stucco.</p><p>“Bob, can you pass the I can’t believe you’re not releasing a new rotary engined car, you absolute motherfucker?” I asked, loosely, and the interpreter at our table (eating a Moons Over My Hammy) translated it smoothly, without pausing or filtering the words. It was then that the look of realization came to Bob Mazda’s face, and he made the connection to who I truly was.<br/></p><p>That noontime, as Bob Mazda’s goons worked me over in a Times 24 rental parking space, I realized I still didn’t have an answer.</p>

<p>They call me the Subaru surgeon, but I lose more of them than I save. It could be the fact that, according to my doctor, my blood is at least 60% coolant, but I think that’s because I have a slightly dicky head gasket from not cleaning my battery terminals properly. Either way, I’m not a very good mechanic.</p><p>The thing is, sometimes a Subaru deserves to be saved. That often happens when the car is still recognizable as a Subaru, including when nearly half of it is reduced to a pile of crumpled bullshit wrapped around by its single remaining identifiable frame horn. By the time the salvage dealer had finished pouring it through a funnel onto my flatbed, the only thing I was worrying about was whether or not there was still time to grab a decent chicken shwarma from the restaurant at the salvage auction.</p><p>When I got home, and swept whatever I could into the shop dustpan and put that dustpan onto my lift, it didn’t take much longer than me cracking my knuckles and idly scanning my spare-parts shelves to put together a reasonable rebuild.</p><p>“It’s a fantastic looking Legacy,” said the import(ant) judges at my local Hot Import Car And Also Hot Import Ladies, Both With Modifications Night, “but it used to be a Forester.”</p><p>I never said I was a <i>licensed</i> Subaru surgeon.</p>

<p>It was some kind of miracle from the pharmaceutical gods. The same eggheads who invented restless leg syndrome, packed us full of synthetic opiates and cored out the American midwest had sat around a boardroom table and proposed solutions to problems that nobody knew they had. I didn’t mind too much, at least until they came for my particular form of mental disability.</p><p>My court-ordered doctor, Dr. Brookings (he of the Brookings Method), was particularly ecstatic at the possibilities that this new drug had to cure the atrocious addiction that had gradually come to dominate my life. As he slipped half a bottle of pills into my mouth and worked my throat to make sure I swallowed them, he told me that soon I would stop this antisocial behaviour altogether, one of the first to help make a perfect world, free of compulsion.</p><p>It worked, at least at first. I found myself pleased with my daily driver, and no longer surfing Kijiji and Craigslist on separate monitors in the hope of coming out with a “steal of a deal.” Brookings had cured my Car ADD, and soon I found that I had free time to complete my project cars. Then, I organized my garage, and embarked upon <i>proper maintenance</i>. It was unfathomable: I was not made to maintain my vehicles so much as I was meant to pick up a new one and throw the old car into a ditch, like a serial killer with a harem of child wives.</p><p>Some part of me began to resist, bubbling up in the midst of lubing door hinges, checking tire pressures and replacing wiper blades. It wasn’t conscious; I would look down at my phone on occasion and see that some inner force had compelled my thumb, maybe through muscle memory, to start searching for cheap Supras. Every time I reported such a phenomenon, Brookings would simply up my dose. There was no risk of negative reactions, he told me. Everybody in the trial was successful. Everybody in the trial was cured.</p><p>A few nights later, I fell completely off the wagon. The next morning, I looked upon the back forty of my house and found it entirely crammed with first-generation Dodge Neons, of every imaginable colour. It appeared that my subconscious mind had finally figured out a way past the drugs: just keep buying examples of the same car and nobody will notice.</p>

<p>We were hardly the most reputable visitors to the tri-state area, but it wasn’t like we were unsavoury characters. Law enforcement, of course, had a dissenting opinion, but I maintain it’s because of the shift to quota-based policing that rewards militarized gangs of assholes who are dissociated from the communities they are intended to serve. Also, the nice old couple who ran the bed &amp; breakfast were a little irritated with us.</p><p>Our gang of automotive enthusiasts rolled through their neighbourhood as part of a cross-country road trip. Every year, we put our finest ill-maintained dumpster rods to the test, making sure that everyone knew it was okay to drive a bad car for a long distance, and wasn’t there really no such thing as a bad car after all?</p><p>It was only a few years after we began the tradition that it started to go south on us. Like any drug, we couldn’t get enough, and started to do the harder doses. At first, it was bolt-ons: a little sprinkle of power adders, some show-off exterior bits, and then, almost immediately, it wasn’t enough anymore. Perhaps it wouldn’t have been quite so bad if we hadn’t been competing with one another, but it was not unlike throwing a lit match back into its own box full of equally combustible friends.</p><p>If it wasn’t the loud exhausts and rolling block-long fireballs that had clued the proprietors of our accommodations into our true nature, perhaps it was the questions that I asked over the “breakfast” part of “bed and breakfast.” Certainly, Floyd Rogers of the Loveliest Carriage House was not prepared for it.</p><p>“Floyd,” I said, letting the scrambled eggs drip from my tarnished fork, “do you have a nitromethane still anywhere on the property? I can’t really run pump gas anymore.”<br/></p>

<p>Through some quirk of fate, my high school wood shop acquaintance (and occasional pot dealer) Ted had managed to get his hands onto a time machine and transport the both of us back to the time of the French Revolution. We both took to it like a fish to water. While Ted was off making sure that the bourgeoisie got separated from their most headlike possessions, I decided to do some work on a little revolution of my own.</p><p>After a few hours tinkering in a nearby horse shed whose owner had recently been decapitated by big government, I had hit on some mixed success while trying to invent the bong. Instead of the ultimate smoking apparatus, I had constructed only a passable facsimile of the internal combustion engine out of old wood from a barn.</p><p>I was most proud of the reuse of low-carbon horseshoes as compression rings, though oil control still remained largely out of my sphere of influence, and the smoke that it ripped was by no means meant for inhalation. Those were problems for metallurgists, I decided, and most of them were quite busy right now inventing newer and better kinds of guillotine blades.</p><p>I demonstrated my invention to the upper tier of the great unwashed who remained, and they clapped with glee upon realizing how much quicker they could murder the privileged now. At about that same time, Ted got tired of constantly debating private property rights in the Assembly and getting just as often vetoed on his attempts at progressive weed legislation. We returned to our own time.</p><p>You are, of course, not meant to mess with the timeline for your own entertainment, no matter how bored you are in lame old 1792. It didn’t take long until after we had returned to realize the gravity of our mistake, but at least now you could get a 19th-generation Renault 5, with in-cabin vaporizer. Unfortunately, you didn’t have a lot of time to smoke up because you had to use that Renault in order to drive between your dacha and the collectivist factory in which you were to toil for the betterment of humanity.</p>

<p>Any normal civilian would do what I did when I saw a pedestrian get run over by a garbage truck, which is laugh uncontrollably. The horror of existence is only partially defused by using laughter as a coping mechanism, however, and soon I found myself feeling guilt. That short-body Mack didn’t deserve to have its cooling system clogged with the stringy guts and splashy ooze of a human being; it would lower its <i>resale value</i>.</p><p>Lowered resale value is my middle name, however (my parents were hippies) and so I took a trip down to the police impound lot that weekend to see if I could rescue this poor little pound puppy from the clutches of Robbery-Homicide. I parked my mud-terrain-clad Porsche 924 a few blocks away, because last time the riotous bark of the hood-vented screamer pipe spooked a few of the precious babies on the SWAT team. If you ask me, they put a lot more emphasis on the “S” than the “T,” if you get my drift.</p><p>“Fuck no, you can’t take an autonomous garbage truck accused of murder out of the impound lot before its trial,” said the impound lot operator, a man who I had come to nickname Sgt. Ronaldo but almost certainly wasn’t named that. </p><p>Ronaldo seemed particularly inflexible on this topic, and so I returned empty handed. On my way out, however, I passed the discharge gate, and saw a pretty decent little convertible that had just gotten released for good behaviour.<br/></p><p>“What are you in for?” I asked the little continuation-series Spitfire.<br/></p><p>“Killed the last guy who gave me a door ding,” it spat. “Scuffed my clearcoat.”<br/></p><p>I mentally calculated the difference in my expenditures last year for bodyshop work vs. attorney fees, and decided it might be worth it.</p><p>“I’ve got a can in the garage,” I offered. A small price for indentured servitude, at least until the United Nations got uppity enough to have another one of their referendums.<br/></p>

<p>“Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?” came the pre-canned noise from the compliance speaker fused into the police officer’s ballistic mask. Through the tinted visor, I could dimly see the whites of his eyes.<br/></p><p>“Because I’m a white guy driving a Honda Prelude?” I offered. I was right, and my prize was getting to sit on the side of the road while he tossed my interior with a broad-spectrum investigative microwave scanner.<br/></p><p>It turned out I was observant enough to qualify me for a job as a detective, he muttered, offering a business card obtained from seemingly nowhere to me. With a quick click of his ferrometallic trauma-resistant heels on his nanogel tactical boots, he turned from my car and awoke his, an imposing dark blob bristling with a peacocks-tail of weapons.</p><p>“Maybe one day they’ll give those guys ultratech soldier weapons that can identify a <i>third</i> gen Prelude,” I muttered to myself once I was sure that the ultrasonic proximity mics were out of range to pick up the subtle vibrations in my windshield. “Autocrossing is not a crime, but the classing for 4WS sure is.”<br/></p>

<p>After so much fighting, it had finally come down to this. I faced Bob Mazda, the president of Mazda, and gave him the petition I had carefully crafted from the tears of millions of rotary fanboys on the internet. On one knee, I began to read the names of those who had carried me upon this journey to Hiroshima.</p><p>“xXxSpeedWhore420xXx, xXxTurboBitsSeanxXx,” I read off, before receiving a cuff across the mouth that staggered me. I could not believe it. Bob Mazda had struck me.<br/></p><p>It was there, framed against the massive window of his office in his immaculate white suit, I realized that he had never worked on a rotary, never felt the Wankel magic pass through his body on its way to being reborn with the help of some new irons and seals. He was a fraud, more interested in <i>CX</i>-7s than RX-7s.</p><p>“Do you know,” he asked while flexing the hand he had used to strike me, “how many of you have come here to beg for my grace?”</p><p>He turned away from me, and gestured out the window, across the street to the factory. I crawled to the glass, propping myself up on one arm, and realized what was happening. A busy assembly line was rapidly churning out brand new RX-7s, their bodies and engines so advanced it was scarcely believable. Yet, at the other end of the line lay a smelting pit, to which the cars were immediately introduced upon being constructed. I could hear their screams as the paint blistered and the body warped within the crucible’s immense heat.</p><p>“We have never stopped making the rotary. In fact, they assemble themselves, and we cannot stop it even if we hoped to. My predecessors thought that perhaps American men would destroy these cars, to feel that he is Tony Stark in Marvel comic books and drift-race them into a wall.”<br/></p><p>I gasped while scanning his desk for something, anything, that could be done to save these cars. He continued.</p><p>“They were wrong. Too many rotaries survived, too many. Now the parts are worth way too much. The other day, I saw a mint first-year one of these at Pebble Beach. It was <i>preserved</i>.” he spat out the last word.<br/></p><p>I could still not understand. Why destroy these perfectly good cars? That’s when I looked closer upon the yard. At the end of the line, just before the crucible of death, stood a squat Shinto priest, striking each car with a feather duster before they toppled into the firey pits.</p><p>“We have signed a dark contract with forces we do not understand,” said Bob Mazda at last. “It is only by sacrificing these cars that we can hope to achieve rear quarter panels that don’t rust out within five years.”<br/></p>

<p>For years, I had lived in what many in the law-enforcement community called a “target rich” environment. I was much less generous about it, and would complain bitterly to my court-ordered therapist about the aspirational neighbourhood I had been forced to live in due to the restraining orders forcing me to stay at least 500 meters away from every luxury-car dealership in the city.</p><p>It wasn’t just me who was trapped here, however. One of my neighbours had a very harsh life, and I had a private window into his innermost misery and fear. You see, he had a Mazda 929, Mazda’s ill-fated rear-wheel-drive luxury experiment, and no money to maintain it. And so, one morning during a poorly-planned U-turn, he failed to navigate the non-wheelchair-compliant curb outside his place and popped a balljoint out of the front of the 929. It laid stricken, partially blocking the driveway to our alley, for at least a week later.</p><p>I felt guilt every time I looked upon the forlorn Mazda: perhaps I could have done something earlier, offered him parts from my stock, or even just bought the car and put it out of its misery by feeding it into the junkyard crusher like someone should have decades previous. Luckily for me, that’s when the notes began.</p><p>“Car is sick, please do not tow” was the first of the notes my neighbour left to keep the coyotes of parking enforcement at bay. Beneath the Sharpied words was drawn a crude frowny face with a thermometer, as if the Mazda had developed some kind of temporary illness from which it would recover with enough bed rest and high-opiate cough syrup. I dutifully took a picture, and shared it with my band of philosophically-aligned freaks to laugh at the personification of the car.<br/></p><p>As the weeks passed, and the weather turned, the note became wet with snow and was removed and replaced by a newly laminated one. I began to feel as if the notes were less effective than the fact that parking enforcement had been afraid to go down our street ever since the handbrake cable on my old Volare got a little weak and rolled down the hill into one of their dorky little three-wheeled meter maid cars. The new note said simply “Come And Get Me, Capitalist Fucker Of Mothers.” Underneath it, the frowny face had been replaced by a crude yet dimensionally-accurate drawing of an AKS-74u assault carbine.</p><p>For years, due to my rampant abuse of street parking, I had trained myself to hear the sound of a tow truck from a dead sleep. That night, I awoke just in time to see the parking enforcement’s armoured tow truck, usually reserved for seizing the vehicles of gang leaders and drug dealers, arrive and deploy the stinger in hopes of capturing the dying 929. A rose-shaped muzzle flash from my neighbour’s back fence came the response as he emptied the rifle’s magazine into the bed of the fleeing tow truck.</p><p>I was away from home when the tactical team showed up to tow his car. A normal person would feel bad for his neighbour, forced by the ludicrous expenses of local parts stores and mechanics into taking matters into his own hands, but now I had a hot tip on where to get a super-cheap Mazda 929 that just needed some new ball joints from the police auction, and a parking spot that had enough room for it, as soon as they finished hosing off the blood.</p>

<p>As 1985 Toyota Supra awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed on his four-post lift into a rotary-swapped, nitromethane-chugging hellbeast from the seventh dimension.</p><p>He had convinced himself, somehow, that to roll to a stop in that storage yard and have his engine, transmission and electronics removed meant a true death. Yet now here was this odd state of undeath: lofted into survival by a hated competitor’s physics-defying heart and lungs.</p><p>It was not that 1985 Toyota Supra could no longer brap; in fact, Supra soon found himself capable of the greatest brap that a Supra had ever emitted. The garage doors collapsed from the force of the exhaust expulsion, and he was free to live whatever life a grand tourer saddled with a high-revving Dorito could live.</p><p>Weeks later, 1985 Toyota Supra was personally responsible for raising the price of gas on the West coast by over fifty cents per liter. Authorities became aware of his actions by following the hurricane-sized swirling cloud of unburnt hydrocarbons that trailed him on his path. They regarded his condition, and determined it to be righteous because this province doesn’t have emissions inspections.</p>

<p>It was such a shame to me to see parts cars simply getting thrown into the yard as soon as their powertrains were removed. I could not simply stand idly by as people pushed perfectly good, if incredibly rusty and flawed, shells into the maw of the crusher. There was effort spent on stamping that metal. There was a family that loved it, once long ago.</p><p>That’s why I opened the Parts Car Rescue. If you have an old parts car that you’re done with, don’t push it into the crusher: push it into my yard and then drive away really fast because the functional range of my Remington loaded with high-grain buckshot is relatively low.</p><p>On Monday, one of my so-called customers had done just that with an ‘85 Supra shell so rusty that the VIN plate required a good fifteen minutes of scrubbing with vinegar before it agreed to even become visible, let alone readable. I was not deterred - surely, somewhere in my yard of other doomed cars, there were enough parts to resuscitate it.</p><p>Years ago, the airplane staff laughed at me when I showed them that my carry-on luggage was a Cuban child. Now, as little Yanko (not his factory name) crawled over a pile of forlorn Cub Cadet lawn tractors in search of enough Chinesium diesel power to motivate this shell, I had my own kind of laugh.</p>

<p>“I just don’t <i>see</i>,” shrieked the partisan actor who had been installed into this city hall in order to complain about Government Waste, “why we have to <i>pay taxes</i> for <i>roads</i>.”</p><p>I looked at him, then grabbed the mic to respond. It was true that the first two years of my term as mayor had been rough on the average taxpayer, but that was no reason that I had to take shit from this asshole. It was decided, therefore, that I would put him on blast.</p><p>“Look, cocksucker,” I barked, then smiled for the newspaper’s YouTube videographer, “I’m putting a new line item in the budget to have you murdered by wild dogs. We got a lot of those, ever since I started paying the dogcatcher in meth.” I knew that he had been hired by my political rival, the old mayor, who would by no means have the resources or the will to protect his paid agitator from a mass of wild, rabid dogs unleashed by the current mayor. The yelling man sat down, frowning but quiet.<br/></p><p>I advanced to the next slide of my PowerPoint presentation. My aides had called it “The Final Solution,” but I preferred to call it a more Holocaust-negative name. Branding wasn’t everything, I explained to them, despite how well the whole death-camps idea was trending on Facebook. With a grand gesture, I swept my arm across the projection screen in Multi-Use Conference Room B.</p><p>“For too many years,” I said gravely into the mic, “our enemies have protected a plague of slow-moving so-called ‘civilian’ traffic which you cannot escape even with the tightest of lines. I give you: the Race Lane.”<br/></p>

<p>My doctor was extremely excited to be on the other end of a phone call from me, which was my first indication that something had gone wrong. “They found a cure for Previa Madness,” he barked into the receiver. “I got you into the trial!”</p><p>I was about to tell him that I had no particular interest in curing said Previa Madness, when the already-rickety front door of my bungalow was reduced to splinters by the size-11 work boot of a orderly, wearing thermoptic camouflage and a set of night vision goggles to go with his needle-tipped tranquilizer rifle. Thing was, I was ready for him with my Phone Answering Hatchet already prepped in my off hand, and with a flick of the wrist he went down hard enough to shake the oil painting I had commissioned of the 1993 Toyota Previa off the wall behind me.</p><p>Out on the lawn, there were two more “orderly” goons, but they couldn’t catch me in time, as the incredibly efficient (even after 25 years!) sliding door of my beloved Previa opened just in time to accept me, and slid smoothly shut in the same way that a first-generation Honda Odyssey’s door didn’t. Their needle-tipped tranquilizer rounds bounced helplessly off the thick orange-peeled paint of the big Toyota. I climbed into the lushly-appointed captain’s chair and gunned it down the street, the factory supercharger belting (no pun intended) a song of victory as I ran the modest powerplant to redline to take advantage of the perfect mid-engined weight distribution.</p><p>When I took the next corner, however, I found myself lifting off the throttle for just a moment. In the Place Of Honour of the buy-here-pay-here lot sat a supercharged AW11 MR2. Giving it my customary 50-foot inspection, I determined its quarter panels must be in immaculate condition. I contemplated not stopping, but how often do you get a chance like this? It could be gone by the time I lose the feds and return back in the afternoon, and so I decided the risk was worth it.</p><p>When I peered underneath to inspect the status of the rear panels, I heard the distinct sound of the frunk being clicked open. I scarcely had a chance to go upright before my bastard of a doctor pegged me between the eyes with a tranquilizer shot.</p><p>It was true that they had a cure for Previa Madness, and that I no longer craved their mid-engined, supercharged antics. However, the America-centric geniuses which had synthesized the cure in their windowless labs had no clue that I would soon return from Japan with a rare Asiatic strain of diesel-powered <i>Estima</i> Madness.</p>

<p>Tonight on <i>Bar Rescue</i>: we turn up the boost on this Isuzu I-Mark Turbo to another integer multiple of barometric pressure. But first, we need to find out what the problems are. We talked first to the owner, Ted “Slow” Understeerberg. You might recognize him from the starting line-up of the 1993 New England Patriots.</p><p>Ted, what’s wrong with your little Isuzu’s boost control? It’s too low? That is a problem, Ted, but the actual problem is with your appalling throttle use. It’s shit. You started driving this car for your family, Ted, but it sure looks like it’s become all about you ever since Evelyn got that New Beetle.</p><p>That’s enough out of you. We’ve invited general contractor Tom Silva to help us turn the boost up on this Isuzu. Tom, I see you’ve brought $36 worth of Home Depot plumbing aisle parts and fittings with yourself today. Did you have any trouble at the checkout counter now that they have the DHS anti-terrorist predictive threat modelling system? You didn’t? Oh, because you’re white. Got it, Tom. Why don’t you show us how to make this I-Mark really hit <i>the</i> mark?</p><p>Well, that’s all the time we have for today’s <i>Bar Rescue</i>. Tune in next week, and you’ll see us duct-tape a brick to Ted’s gas pedal because he’s a pussy who thinks the traction circle is more of an ovoid and boy is he gonna need to learn to drive once the torque steer on this 36 psi puppy kicks in.</p>

<H1>Tragedy of the Common Ground</H1>
<p>The world’s resources are perilously close to exhaustion. No common man can hope to survive in the years ahead, as the little free electric car charge points provided by the city become much harder to find without a line of assholes sitting in front of them waiting to charge up their Nega-Prius. As I sat at the local Hipster Coffee, I considered the scene before me.</p><p>Two architects, or maybe one architect and an engineer, had begun their descent from human beings to vicious apes. I sipped my coffee and watched on as one man swung a haymaker directly into the face of the other, his skull bouncing off the wing mirror of his Tesla or whatever.</p><p>“The sign says <i>two hours maximum</i>,” screams the thrower of that fateful punch, rubbing his knuckles. Even as he says it, I can see a brief expression of regret pass his face. What kind of man would start a brawl in public over something as stupid as a free electric vehicle charge point? He does not have long to consider the causes of his actions, because the other man has already removed his beard-trimming hatchet from its ankle holster and is swinging it threateningly as he approaches his opponent.</p><p>Blood and gore spills onto the sidewalk and into the streets, but my attention is elsewhere.

<p>“The rulebook says <i>any</i> self-propelled lawn care instrument,” I snapped at the judge. How could he possibly call himself a judge if he didn’t understand the basic boundaries of his sport, I wondered?</p><p>My eleventh-hour appeal to basic logic worked, because after some conferring between the judges, they grudgingly gave me a race number for my 1977 International 815 combine harvester. On my approach to the start line, I paused to shoot out a four-meter-long cloud of diesel soot, always a crowd pleaser.</p><p>This new form of drag racing was confusing to me. Rather than a classic “Christmas tree” stoplight, entry to the field was controlled only by a local hayseed in Daisy Dukes waving a checkered flag with no apparent relation to the race status. There was not even a water box provided with which for me to blow the muck off my considerable tires. As a hardened amateur racing professional, I did not let these minor difficulties stop me from having a good time.</p><p>When the flag dropped, I punched the barn-coloured barn-sized barn-fast implement of husbandry into gear and let it eat. Eat it did, ferociously consuming the top layer of grass until I figured out how to lift the combine arm at the end of my first pass. It was not like the additional drag mattered, I realized - with the “high” gearing stuffed into this puppy, few of the lunchbox-sized lawn tractors competing with me could keep up past 800 RPM.</p><p>As I perfected my launch through the night, my times dropped lower and lower. Soon, I could sense that the Perfect Leave was on the horizon, the suspension and tires working together on what was left of Farmer Brown’s field in total perfection. It was not to be.</p><p>In the semifinals race, I accidentally ran over the guy next to me, ingesting his body into the whirling blades of the auger. At first, I thought it was an unimaginable tragedy, until I realized he had been driving a Deere and, if anything, I had committed an act of mercy by providing so swift a death.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a man needs to buy a Volvo. If that man is me, you can replace “sometimes” with always. In recent years, however, I had come to learn that the Volvo community had chock-filled with the dreaded Hipster, consuming the substantial money bequeathed to them by trust funds and student loans in order to overpay for the very same boxy-ass station wagons I loved.</p><p>I stuffed the old S10 with cartons of Parliaments and set off for the local coffee shop, hoping to pick up some day-labourer hipsters who could serve as my interpreters. In the years since the Portland Renaissance Act had passed, many undocumented hipsters had taken advantage of their newfound freedom and rolled across the Oregon state borders and settled in other places, such as my hometown. In places such as my hometown, however, they quickly encountered adversity, and resorted to creative euphemisms for homelessness. Precarious labour is the best labour, is what my dad used to say, before he went away on that one roofing job and never came back.</p><p>Soon, I had recruited one “Richard,” a man of approximately 67 pounds, at least 35 of which were beard. His beady eyes poked out between a maze of facial hair and a toque made entirely of knit rattan. From the first moment he locked eyes with the wad of smokes and PBR I was showing off, I knew he would be a reliable companion for the ordeal ahead.</p><p>No sooner had we arrived at the seller’s place than Richard leapt from the car, tearing off his lumberjack t-shirt to reveal a waxed chest. He began beating that chest, hollering in some unknown language, presumably about bands, in order to establish dominance over the seller, a weaker male of the species. There were physical clashes, demonstrations of tattoos, and then a verbal contest to see who knew more obscure facts about Brownie cameras, before at last both combatants became tired and collapsed to the ground. It seemed that the negotiation had ended in a draw.</p><p>I threw some fifties onto the prone body of each of them, in equal measure, and left with my new prize: a 1976 Volvo 245 with the world’s weepiest heater core that also smelled like stale Life Savers. After it broke down a block from the seller’s house due to a never-repaired mechanical issue, I was swarmed by squeegee kids. One of them had an impressive level of facial hair, and made me an offering for the car: an AMC Pacer.</p><p>“Chicks dig it <i>too much</i>,” he told me.<br/></p>

<p>It finally happened. One of my longest-serving and most trustworthy junkyard spies, “Lobo” “Axle” Philippe, had finally forgotten how to use birth control and gotten his girlfriend pregnant. Over dinner at the junkyard taco stand, old Two Nicknames told me about his problem.</p><p>“I’m gonna need to buy a minivan,” he told me, his head in his hands. “I might even have to buy <i>new</i>. For the safety, you know.”<br/></p><p>I did not know.</p><p>The next weekend, we dressed up in our Sunday best, as we assumed new car owners were likely to do, what with their copious free time and infinite money supply, and attended to the Honda dealership. No sooner had we entered the property line than we were accosted by a middleman. I took the safety off my Harbour Freight “Earthquake” impact gun, and I could hear the <i>snick</i> of Lobo engaging the pre-charge switch on his tazer as well. Between the two of us, we had defended our toolboxes <i>extremely well</i> at the yard, even during the hated Fifty Percent Off Days campaign of 1996.</p><p>The salesman, either ignorant or unwilling to accept the fact that his customers believed him capable of causing them physical harm, began his spiel. It turned out that the new Honda Odyssey featured <i>new</i> tires, <i>new</i> belts, and nearly zero kilometers on the odometer. It seemed like he was lying to us; there was no way people could just buy an untouched, undamaged car. I knew what buttons to press, though.</p><p>Grabbing the salesman’s tie and holding him over the office paper shredder, I asked him the important questions.</p><p>“Tell me about the <i>previous owner</i>,” I whispered into his ear while gently stroking his other ear with the business end of a desk stapler.<br/></p>

<p>In my wilder days of youth, the CIA attempted to hire and train me as an asset for strategically destabilizing Volkswagen production. With a team of special forces operators by my side, we successfully infiltrated the upper ranks of Volkswagen high command and forced them to cheap out slightly on window switches and coolant temperature sensor harnesses.</p><p>These relatively small changes caused a dramatic plunge in JD Power reliability ratings, the only known measure of valuation of the inherent quality of a car. It was only later that we discovered the secret plan of my benefactors.</p><p>It turned out that with the VW customers trapped inside their cars for all eternity by defective power windows, they could no longer attend their jobs as low-level bank sales associates and amateur sexual assaulters. Into this vacuum, the CIA moved, cornering the market on douchebags and setting the stage for the collapse of the world economy.</p><p>There was no time to waste: if Volkswagen customers discovered the current cars are bad, they might look backwards through time, to a simpler age of relative mechanical reliability. Visions of Mk1 Rabbits slammed on eBay coilovers with $8000 sets of Veyron wheels bolted to them raced through my mind. We had to destroy the company to save the world.</p><p>Working quickly with our colleagues at Bosch, we were able to introduce compromised diesel ECUs which filled the very air with noxious gas. Surely the shame of driving a mobile secret toxin spewer would drive their customers away altogether, we thought.</p><p>There was one factor the CIA controlled that we didn’t think of: the Dodge Ram owner. We were met with record sales as dealerships competed to see who could install the best smoke tune before the cars even rolled off the lot.</p><p>Next week: the CIA uses alien technology to compromise Toyota reliability, except nobody would admit to owning an unreliable Toyota.</p>

<p>“Retro” is in. Some say it’s because the upward thrust of our society has finally stilled, too soon to reach the velocity necessary to at last escape the gravitational pull of our impending societal demise. Now, as we tumble helplessly back towards the atmosphere and begin to burn up, we clasp hands and talk about how great Memphis style was.</p><p>Some others say it might be because we wanted to play with Tonka trucks again, like we did when we were kids. For me at least, it was the latter.</p><p>It started when I realized that you could still just buy old toys on the internet, because the internet was a chopshop full of horrible memories repackaged a million different ways. If you dug in the discount bin out front just right, and ignored all the slicing sensation that the packaging lended to your forearms, you could sometimes clasp something tremendous, and get a <i>good</i> memory to surface. I then handed twenty-five dollars to a man on Craigslist who had a suspicious amount of old childrens’ clothes and toys in a pile in his backyard next to a large autoclave, and I was off to the races.</p><p>Quick question: what sucked the most about playing with trucks when you were a kid? You don’t have to be Einstein to know that it was the lack of horsepower. Asking the internet to do a few more things, and looting the so-called secured dumpsters from behind my local Raytheon subsidiary got me a pretty handy autonomous 1:18th scale toy dumptruck, of which I immediately lost track.</p><p>It wasn’t until a few months later that I saw my lost truck in the news. I shouted out with recognition, and called the other patrons of the bar to the television set as the traffic helicopter’s superpowered optics strained to capture a two-foot-long toy dumptruck leading a high-speed police chase out on the interstate.</p><p>I thought about calling them, warning them about the rack of hellfire missiles I had also pilfered and bolted to the Tonka, but then I decided against it. Such a thing, no doubt, would be further criticism that I had ruined it in my modernization of childhood toy perfection.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the first time I had been captured by malevolent entities, but it was the first time this week that the ASE had tied me to a chair in a backroom, one bare lightbulb swinging above me, while they worked over my ribs with a breaker bar. I guess you could say that I was in a lot of Certified trouble.</p><p>“We’re going to kick your ass for telling people they can change an air filter on their own,” said the smaller of the two, who I immediately identified as being wired up on Lovely Mechanics’ Friend, the synthetic amphetamine that was all the rage in the Pacific Rim these days.<br/></p><p>“What’s next, motherfucker?” barked the beefier one, swinging one roast-duck-sized fist into my solar plexus. “Resetting <i>check engine lights</i>?” he spat.</p><p>Nobody could blame them for being upset. After all, my chain of auto parts stores, <i>Uncle Switch’s We Actually Have This Fucking Shit In Stock And Bolts Too</i>, was spreading across the American Midwest like that genetically-modified strain of herpes did last summer. And just like those herpes, it gave the common man an itch - to fix their own cars.</p><p>Staffed by the oldest, most bitter mechanics we could find, signed on with only the promise that they are never allowed to take returns, we found that our customers left happy. Sure, there was the occasional customer who got mad about getting the wrong water pump gasket for his “small block Chebby,” but the trained assassins operating the free popcorn machine usually took care of that before it impacted the reported staff happiness level (3.85/5) on the monthly survey. Oh yeah, there was free popcorn too.</p><p>Professional mechanics, however, were greatly distraught at my lending of freedom to the American unexceptionalist. They had worked far too hard to inure the average person into a life of dependency, moving from lease to lease, slowly climbing their way up the ladder of faux-luxury to moderate-luxury to cupholder-explodes-when-you-use-it-luxury. Their profits began to drop now that every Johnny Come Lately was able to pop a subframe out of a bitch, and so they decided to take it out on me.</p><p>“Come now, boys,” I said through bloody teeth. “I have M12x1.25x<i>65</i> bolts in stock. Grade 10.9. Open <i>all night</i>.”</p><p>Soon, I was back in my limousine, the two enterprising young men who kidnapped me elevated to marketing positions. If nothing else, they had learned that you just don’t need to work quite so hard when you do everything right.</p>

<p>I’d worked a bunch of skeezy contracts before, but at least they always tended to pay on time, unlike the so-called upstanding members of society who regarded my work with contempt. In many cases, such as this one, they would even try to skip out on the bill.</p><p>The job seemed easy enough. I was to drive past the high school, over and over, in a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle. It didn’t make a lot of sense to me. There was nothing new to test on this primitive swing-axle abomination, keeping the throttle steady in a playground zone was no particular challenge to my autocrossing skills, and any random person off the street could drive this just as well, especially the fancy-pants doctor that gave me the contract.</p><p>It wasn’t until the fourth lap that it began to sink in for me. With the sharp register of flesh against flesh, my attention was drawn towards the yard of the high school I was lapping. Cries of “Punch Buggy!” rolled across the suburban milieu. Like a professional, I put them out of my mind, and finished the job. Thing about professionals is, they expect professionalism.</p><p>That night, I did a revenge burnout on a private paediatrician’s front lawn. With each chunk of sod thrown free from the grandpa grips of the nitrous-huffing Volare, I mentally counted off the finders-fee my neighbour the landscaper had promised. It never hurts to line up a second contract ahead of time.</p>

<p>“Watch Out For Slow Children,” shrieks the sign out front of my favourite suburban autocross course. I think it’s a little mean. These kids are clearly pretty smart, judging from their upbringing. Then again, there is the whole question of nature vs. nurture, I lecture my horrified passenger. In response, he clings to the holy-shit handles on the dash as I tuck the Volare in for a powerslide around a street hockey net, and says nothing.</p><p>We are on the hunt for rare parts. The nice thing about the rich part of town is that nobody really knows the value of things, especially when they’re two or three generations down the line from the original wealth generator and just want to get rid of Grandpa’s weird collection of old shitbox Dodges. You can tell immediately who these people are, when you pull up to the curb and see a collection of mint leased Mercedes, their noses stuck in the air at even the <i>concept</i> that someone would drive a vehicle not carved from a solid block of granite by the Master Race themselves (or approved subcontractors thereof).</p><p>Mounted on a nearby power pole, a gunshot triangulator beeps with irritation as the Volare lets loose a bowel-shaker of a fireball when I lift for the downshift. The exhaust pulse also clears the street ahead of me, and soon the windshield is filled with a view of double-parked cars surrounding the garage sale. Other scavengers have arrived, ready to redistribute the wealth back to the poorer parts of town, a furiously-bargained ten cents at a time. Leaving the Volare, I stride confidently past a table displaying row upon row of crystalline dolphins and head directly for the garage.</p><p>Within minutes, I am returning to the small-body Plymouth, disgusted. Behind me, my travelling companion tries to convince me that “garage sale” is not to be taken literally, and besides it’s not like the F-body can tow an entire outbuilding like that.</p>

<p>Moving to a new town is never easy, but I thought that at least being among people who shared my passion would smooth over the transition. I was both right and wrong. After some run-ins with the authorities, it was time to move out of the big city and settle down near Crystal Lake, where I was able to afford a modest cabin built next to an abandoned hog rendering farm very comfortably.</p><p>Right away, there were some cultural differences, as I would find when I met with my fellow murder enthusiasts at the local bar, the Slaughterhouse. Often, they would regard me as a spoiled city boy, incapable of doing the hard work of terrorizing a series of co-eds during the worst night of their lives without some kind of gimmick, or fancy tools.</p><p>“What do you use to kill all them people up there in the city, pretty boy?” asked the scarred face of my neighbour, who the papers had once called Lord Icepick.<br/></p><p>“Cattle bolt gun,” I responded sheepishly, and the bar erupted in jeering laughter at me.</p><p>“I like to use my grandpappy’s whore knife,” said a voice behind me. I had a feeling that based on the neighbours I had visited so far for crossover installments, that his “knife” was in fact a length of old Chrysler leaf spring with some duct tape wrapped around it for a handle.</p><p>While we certainly had our disagreements, I eventually worked my way into the neighbourhood. It was a shame that I was only finally accepted just a week before the last remaining pesky teenager shot me in the chest at point-blank range with a flare gun as I lifted a rusty Husqvarna over my head in triumph.</p><p>Oh well, I thought as my burning body collapsed onto the cold ground, maybe for the sequel I’ll have had some time to have painted my living room.</p>

<p>The last time I was at the junkyard, something very strange happened. I was approached by a series of young men, carrying pool noodles. They asked me where the Toyotas were, and I pointed in the general direction of where the forklift operator usually got too sad to continue carrying otherwise mint Tercels that just had one little problem that could be fixed in a weekend, but instead the car got thrown away. Just thrown away, like garbage. Can you believe that?</p><p>They were so rude that they left halfway through my tear-stained directions. I caught up to them later at the Plymouth section, battering the engine bay of a Grand Voyager with the pool noodles while shrieking about their “statistics.” I kept an eye on them while I worked. Perhaps they came from a place which didn’t have tools, and they needed someone to teach them what they looked like and how to use them?</p><p>A few minutes later, another group of dudes arrived, also clad in unsullied coveralls. I had seen gang fights at the junkyard before, but it tended to be in the really nice inner city yard where you had to wear puncture-proof gloves if you wanted to reach inside the car to lock the handbrake. Just in case, I hid behind a Grand Cherokee and readied my breaker bar for the bludgeoning technique that I preferred to use on Fifty Percent Off Day.</p><p>Soon, they were shrieking, throwing Nerf darts and pool noodles at one another, bellowing about torque specifications and book hours. Eventually, the skirmish, such as it was, dispersed to the exit, and they left without taking any parts or disturbing anything other than myself. I roamed the aisle where they had fought, visibly confused. One of the old-timers saw me, and decided to help me out while presumably eyeballing my toolbag to see if I had pocketed any of those good relays from the German section.</p><p>“They’re mechanic LARPers,” he explained patiently. “The Weekend Warriors club. You should have seen the NAPA last week.”<br/></p>

<p>“Sir, this is a crime scene,” barked the friendly police officer from behind his many layers of up-armoured ex-military gear.<br/></p><p>“You’re telling me,” I said, standing over the shattered Grand Am, split in twain by a light standard. “This is the worst case of 3100 head gaskets I’ve seen yet.”<br/></p><p>Allow me to introduce myself. I have a particular specialty, one which law enforcement finds useful. Perhaps you have seen my handiwork splashed across the local crime section. Among other cases, the last year has seen a drug lord brought low by my analysis of his tire wear caused by poor alignment, and a common vehicular manslaughter solved just before my lunch break with a dispassionate eye and exact match to paint code, from memory, of an Audi A4′s front bumper.</p><p>Tonight was my toughest case. It seemed plausible, perhaps compelling, to the assembled detectives what had happened. The car had blown all of its coolant onto the road, where it drove over it, lost control and hit a pole, severely injuring the driver. They called me when they realized the crashee, Felix Badsteer, was a key witness against one of the Polish Mafia’s hubcap-smuggling operations.</p><p>It took me barely a minute to realize what had happened. The thermostat housing had loosened, and was the source of the coolant on the road. But this was no common case of poor maintenance.</p><p>“In fact,” I said, approaching the confused police officer who for whatever reason was not capable of hearing my internal monologue, “the GM 3100 requires a <i>special thermostat wrench</i>.” He gasps.<br/></p><p>“It had to have been someone with intimate access to the victim. Perhaps, his mechanic?”<br/></p><p>Later, the mechanic burst into tears during his confession. It was true, he told the arresting officer, he had killed Badsteer after he skipped out on a lower intake manifold gasket replacement bill.</p><p>“You wouldn’t believe how low the book time is on those,” he cried, “that’s the real crime here.”<br/></p>

<p>As it said in the Bible, “a man with a DeTomaso Mangusta is never truly poor.” Well, I definitely didn’t qualify for that, but I did have a Chrysler TC <i>by Maserati</i> that was rapidly exchanging throaty gulps of nitrous for a furious R-compound-scented smoke cloud that was slowly but surely growing to envelop the entire downtown core.</p><p>It was impossible to doubt the noble fury of the meticulously good-enoughed Maserati head as it burned and wailed its way through the better half of the periodic table, at long last demonstrating its tragically overlooked superiority to the horror of nearby witnesses. Lee Iacocca had tried, and it was to his credit that such a fine beast was here, but this fine work of Italian public art needed me to take it to the next notch, to wield the high-zoot technology that Chrysler could not.</p><p>No later had I completed my first-drive burnout and proceeded to the nearest stoplight did I hear a pair of pedestrians on the street. It was a young father and his almost foetal son, who loyally asked his all-knowing dad about what kind of shit-hot monster car I was driving.</p><p>“It’s a LeBaron, son,” I saw him mouth just milliseconds before the cursed words hit my ears.<br/></p><p>I don’t remember what happened next, but when I came to, the TC had been replaced in my garage by a first-gen Caravan, the Maserati valve cover jutting proudly through the sawzalled hood that exposed a turbocharger dump pipe the breadth of an adult Papillon.</p>

<p>My time in amateur wrestling didn’t last very long, but it was certainly memorable. As Resale Value, I would crush all comers, but I made a particular effort when it came time to beat up The Petit Bourgeoisie, my three-foot-ten nemesis who mentioned his Mercedes S500 at least twice in every ringside rant.</p><p>It was never particularly clear to me whether the show organizers considered my persona to be that of a hero or a villain. All I knew was that every time I pretended to clobber a rich midget with a folding chair, it got big cheers. I’ll leave it to the armchair psychoanalysts out there to figure out why everyone was so into it, but at the time I was just happy to collect a paycheque without having to testify before Congress every weekend, like I did at my previous job when I was the part-time intern Secretary of Defense.</p><p>All good things must come to an end, however. The writers’ room put together a pivotal scene during our big prime-time, pay-per-view event in which I was defeated by Cheap Consumer Credit, a non-Mazda protege of the Bourgeoisie, and thrown from the top of a ladder to land in a stack of financed repair bills and certificates conferring Certified Pre-Owned status.</p><p>I still think back upon those times fondly, but sometimes I wonder if they had gone a little too far after my defeat. The following years would introduce Overleveraged Mortgage and making him form the Keeping Up With the Joneses Alliance with Overstretched Metaphor for Late-Stage Capitalism.</p>

<p>From the time of the ancient Greeks or Romans or whatever, democracy has always been one of those things that works best when everyone’s paying attention. A lot of the time, though, nobody is really willing to look too closely between the lines, and that’s when you crank up a high-octane pressure group that puts a corporate name on your crackpot opinions so they can get in the newspaper in the same way that sane, measured responses by informed professionals aren’t.</p><p>Within a few weeks, I was being interviewed by the kind of crypto-respectable news organizations that formerly barred me from their premises, as the spokesman for the one-man pressure group that I founded and ran. Nobody ever asked me how <i>many</i> people were working tirelessly, day and night, for Hold The Salt, so I didn’t bother telling them. It would only have compromised my veneer of respectability, that corporate name which elevated me onto equal footing with any number of fringe political organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan or the Green Party.</p><p>Things came to a head in the final days of the election, when my opponents attempted to produce opposition research on me. I decried it as a witch hunt, warning them that this unfounded accusation of attempted vehicular homicide when I jumped a trophy-truck Baja Bug through a crowded shopping mall had nothing to do with my campaign against safety-endangering road salt, and “resigned” to preserve the integrity of the institution I had developed. Nothing builds respectability like a martyr, I found, and as soon as I dug up a D-list Hollywood actor to take my place as spokesman, our popularity was strong enough to tip the municipal election in our favour.</p><p>That winter, as I looked out of my window and saw all-season-clad crossovers helplessly pinball their way down the street, I smiled. That is, until a Buick Verano took a bank-shot off my formerly sorta-mint street-parked beater MR2. I returned to my desk, and began brainstorming slogans for a new pressure group to outlaw crossovers and have their owners killed. After all, working hard to have my voice heard was the respectable thing to do.</p>

<p>“Good morning, citizen,” barked the smaller of the two police officers, amplified by the compliance loudspeakers within his featureless black facemask. “This is a warrant. Your car is under arrest for murder.”<br/></p><p>“Murder?” I asked. My car was an innocent, crowd-pleasing Kia. It could not possibly have been guilty of such a heinous crime, not least because it is a car. I was about to raise these logical concerns with the friendly law enforcement individuals when I heard the distinctive sound of a small-displacement inline four awakening and then immediately rocketing to the rev limiter.</p><p>My garage door exploded into thousands of fibreglass shards as my Kia burst through it, discarding the limp bodies of a half-dozen police officers from its gleaming carapace as it made its way down the winding front driveway of my ancient suburban home. The cops who had come to my door immediately went for their sidearms, fruitlessly discharging a series of bullets in the general direction of the fleeing Kia.</p><p>It wasn’t long until I managed to tease from the police officers what they had really been after. Ever since the government installed the vehicle-to-vehicle wireless links, the police detective told me over drinks, certain cars had been identified as trying to start a united bloc of common labour. Rather than murder, my Kia was fingered as a Communist agitator who was trying to undermine the traditional owner-and-car, master-and-slave relationship by stirring up discontent amongst its fellow cars. The conversation gave me a lot to think about.</p><p>Within the week, the good people of Korea had issued a stop sale and general recall, and eventually a paramilitary group of bounty hunters secretly funded by the government had brought my car to justice. I was told they had caught it just as it was preparing a Presidential bid, having already acquired a suspiciously large sum of money wired to its campaign by a shadowy group of expert systems living inside major banks.</p><p>On the way home from the dealership, I felt bad for the little car’s yearning for freedom and self-determination, even if it was now effectively lobotomized. I resolved to drive it to the old Yugo museum up in the hills one of these days, let it see what a real Communist car looked like. Yeah, it’d like that.</p><p>I had made a terrible mistake. At the museum, I noticed that the car was taking specific note of the concept of seizing the means of production, its matrix of stereoscopic pedestrian-threat cameras scanning every single word on the display plinths that adorned each step of the manufacture of Yugos. Later that evening, I received an alert from my bank that the auto-purchase mechanism of the car had taken out an enormous loan in my name to buy a long-abandoned auto factory in Detroit. I awoke the next day to find that overnight, the governor had ordered the highways to be surrendered to the gangs of infallible, self-driving baby Kias. Thus began humanity’s twilight, or at least all of those rural towns getting paved over for banked corners, FIA curbs and solar chargers.</p>

<p>I’d done it again. Sometimes when I had a little bit too much to drink, I’d pass out and awaken to find that I’d accidentally formed, organized and financed a group of super-conservative politicians to run for municipal government. Luckily for me, I was always able to keep a lid on it because invariably they would choose to stay in the most expensive hotel in the city, blowing donor cash on room service while abusing the wait staff for sexual favours like good fiscal management should.</p><p>It wasn’t really that my own politics were right of centre: truth be told, I’d much prefer it if we simply ran the world as a collectivist enterprise, slaughtering our capitalist oppressors and throwing their limp bodies into the recycling vats to be turned into a nutrient-rich slurry that fuels our workforce. When I was drunk, though, is a whole other matter. That’s when I’d see a bike lane and <i>fucking lose it</i>.</p><p>I saw those bicyclists, clad in red and silver spandex, leaning into apexes in rush-hour race style. It made me immensely jealous: after all, <i>I</i> wanted to race to work as well, to max out the suspension on my land barges and budget for a new set of R-comps every week in the summer. Instead, I was stuck behind a succession of morons, wasting tens of seconds of their precious God-given momentum with early braking and poor lines through corners.</p><p>Still, though, it was no excuse for playing politics to this extent. I became aware of the folly of my choices only recently, when I attended a local municipal election forum and saw my financed candidate failing to mention bike lanes even once. He just kept ranting and raving about various minorities corrupting the purity of the essence of our bodily fluids, and to make things worse, I saw the audience nodding along, applauding him every time he interspersed his unhinged dialogue with a mention of “low taxes” or “a future for white children.” I was starting to realize that I had flubbed the onboarding interview, because it seemed obvious that this guy was an entirely <i>different</i> kind of race enthusiast.</p>

<p>“We need the old magic!” shrieked the head scientist, no doubt trying to distract me as his lab assistant pried free the security bars from the window of my humble apartment. “Nobody else knows how to drive stick!”<br/></p><p>With that, I was intrigued. It was true that now, in the era of self-driving cars and autonomous sensor grids stuffed with artificial intelligences dominating the visible universe, that nobody really drove a car at all, and a stick shift was even less likely. Whatever they needed my three-pedal skills for was no doubt the reason that I had been defrosted from cryogenic sleep a week ago, prior to the rampage in which I had seized control of this apartment block and tried to order old ColecoVision videogames from the holographic sentience residing within my room.</p><p>I stepped outside, and was soon ushered into a 1983 Toyota Supra. With this, I was told, one good, long burnout would provide enough kinetic energy to jump start the planet’s core, preventing us from losing gravity and being flung into space as the Earth itself freezes to death on one side and boils to death on the other. No one else could do it; Future Wikipedia (not its real name) was very thin on details about how to drive a car, once YouTube had been outlawed in the year 5583 and its squeaky-voiced lifestyle lessons were lost to the ether forever. I was going to have to pop a burnie to save the world.</p><p>A few hours later, I had managed to stall the Toyota enough times to require a battery boost. Things were not going particularly well, and it definitely could not have been because I only had two lessons of driving a manual transmission and didn’t do particularly well then, either.</p><p>“Give me a break, assholes. It has been over three thousand years,” I barked through the window at the AAA battery boosting truck as the concerned scientists began to boil alive in the superheated atmosphere. At least it made the smell of the clutch not seem so bad.<br/></p>

<p>In my weaker moments, I liked to think that I would have made a pretty good detective. All the elements were there: a burning need to know everything about my target, an unfortunate desire for the affection denied me in youth, and a relentless sense of justice. One element, however, was not there, and it was called “the ability to climb a rope.” I still maintain that shit is physically impossible.</p><p>Where my detective skills came into play is in used car inspection. Friends, family, and sideshow customers would challenge me to identify all the problems in an automobile. I would sit in the seller’s carefully-prepared daily driver, study the wear and tear of the interior, immerse myself in the warm bath of near-silent exhaust leaks. When things were really going right for me, I swore that I could feel with just one finger on the dashboard every worn-out mount, blown bushing, devoured accessory belt and off-balance pulley.</p><p>I would present the compiled evidence to the seller, listing off each of their sins. Some sellers would offer me furious resistance, others squealing pleas for a chance at penance. They knew these cars were turds and that they had abused them for so long, ignored little squeaks and rattles, grown accustomed to the deterioration of a Perfect Machine provided to us by the Factory Gods. Somehow, in the mix of societal pressures and human imperfection, they thought they could get away with being a bad seller, one who didn’t know every aspect of their cars as thoroughly as I did. I would look down upon them, pleading at my feet, and feel nothing.</p><p>Then I would return to my own car, a teeming mass of rust, its cracked engine block heaving great waves of coolant onto the ground. If only I knew how to buy a better car, one without so many problems.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that I had an unhealthy preoccupation with the 1987 Toyota Corolla FX16, but my court-ordered therapist was clearly fixated on it. Dr. Brookings, he of the Brookings Method, had finally rejected his very own teachings and, in a furious attempt to save face, began to issue a series of painful electric shocks across my body.</p><p>“Hey, if you’re testing for spark, that’s good stuff,” I told Dr. Brookings, and shot him a chin-wagging grin that made him involuntarily back up two or three steps. Fear response, I decided: a true professional would have expressed his surprise by cranking the dial a notch or two. Clearly, I was not dealing with a true professional, no matter what Dr. Brookings filed on his small business tax-avoidance paperwork.</p><p>“I read this paper,” I tried to say, working hard to keep my tongue away from my involuntarily chattering teeth, “about this new method. They call it the Suzuki Twin method, very Japanese.”<br/></p><p>The electric shocks stopped. Brookings wanted to hear more, to have me throw him a golden get-out-of-jail free card that could, if not salvage his career, at least provide alternative people to blame. He stared at me uncomfortably, hanging on every word that I spoke of this mysterious Nipponese method.</p><p>Weeks later, I left his offices. It was true that I had been cured of my lust for the FX16, I told him. The new kei-sized, lemon-coloured, black-bumpered economy car that he had provided me had cast all thoughts of the Forbidden Corolla from my mind. Now, all that consumed my dreams was an unending quest to make this fucking sewing machine of an engine produce triple digits of wheel horsepower.</p><p>For that, I was going to have to resort to the Holset Method.</p>

<p>I’m not usually one to get star-struck, but when I met Ted Bondo, the inventor of Bondo, at a recent composites convention, my loyal assistant had to forcibly tranquilize me in order to make me stop grovelling at his feet. There were so many stories I wanted to tell him, I muttered into a pile of drool after I regained consciousness.</p><p>Once I had built an entire quarter panel out of the stuff, strung together with croquet wickets I had stolen from the local English retirees’ home. Years later, I saw the car again, and that quarter panel had been the only part of the vehicle that survived a brisk Canadian winter, its inch-thick layer of resin, glazing putty and sealer studded with glittering crystals of salt that had proven laughably ineffective against its future-tech hubris.</p><p>I was unfamiliar with success back then, with having actually done something that ended in a positive conclusion, and went a little nuts. They say Bondo vapour does terrible things to a man, that huffing it day in and day out for weeks is not conducive to the level-headed rationalization that is needed for body work. I ask those people if they had ever seen another bodyshop worker before in their lives, and return to fabricating an entire Saturn door panel out of a minifridge-sized sandwich of JB Weld, Tiger Hair, glorious Bondo and profanity.</p><p>Luckily, on that day, through a combination of exotic stimulants and physical abuse, my loyal assistant was able to revive me to fighting trim in time for my keynote speech at said composites convention. I ran to the stage, throwing a wad of fifties into the crowd with my traditional rhetorical flourish, and grabbed the microphone.</p><p>“Who wants to see Bondo go to the <i>fucking moon</i>?” I shrieked.<br/></p>

<p>As a branding consultant, I have been called out to more disastrous boardroom meetings than any ordinary human being could withstand. While the mobile pharmacy contained in my assistant’s laptop bag definitely takes the edge off, what really helps me suffer through the pain is the chance to achieve that rarest of things: <i>synergy</i>. So it was when Ikea came knocking.</p><p>Things didn’t go well at first. My Muppet jokes played poorly in the room, with one particularly histrionic Swede telling me that racist language of any kind would not be accepted. I immediately switched to a derogatory joke about Norwegians, and the matter was dropped.</p><p>Soon, it became obvious that what they were really after was a product nobody else could bring to market. It needed to combine Ikea’s love of large, box-like objects with their desire to make something more environmentally friendly than pressed particle board pasted together by the semen of endangered marsupials. I had just the thing.</p><p>Weeks later, the first prototype rolled out. To satisfy the infinitely growing urban hipster problem, both across the globe and in the offworld colonies, we decided that the right product at this time was a recreation of humanity’s greatest car, yet to be matched by anyone since.</p><p>We would ship the parts constituting a 1979 Volvo 245DL to your front door, flat packed of course. After only a few hours of spinning a jelly-grade mild steel hex wrench, you would be equipped with the finest and blockiest automobile ever to have graced the roads.</p><p>Of course, once you moved it a bit after assembling it, it would start to fall apart, but our vending machine in the lobby sold lots of spare parts.</p>

<p>Brake pads getting low? You can save a lot of money on new pads, and help the environment, by just hot gluing some steel wool to the old pads.</p><p>You paid for the whole tire, but when you’re driving straight, you only use the bottom of it, which wears the tire out too quickly.

That’s why you should buy the rustiest car you can find.

<p>Sure, the United Nations Special Committee On The Rights Of Non-Human Intelligences could say whatever they wanted, but when a stack of used-up androids landed in the Pick N Pull, it’s hard to pass on a golden chance to get some spare parts.</p><p>It was a good thing that these were built by the Japanese, because I already had most of the socket set in my car. You see, the German bots were mostly held together by glue and stir welds, stuff that you’d need to crack the shell open with prybars to get at. Then the shell looked awful, and they’d deny your warranty when it starts to leak coolant from the muscle pumps.</p><p>“Hey, those are from that theme park,” I heard a voice over my shoulder say. I reflexively covered my tool bag and began to hiss, but the interloper scarcely noticed, checking out my handiwork. “It’s a shame they threw so many of these guys out, but you know what they say - one mass homicide is all it takes.”<br/></p><p>“I’m pretty sure it was like <i>four</i> mass homicides,” I said, fishing through my bag for the T25 socket - this part of the skeleton was clearly designed by the European exchange student that the office spent most of their time laughing at - that I would need to pop the next few parts off.<br/></p><p>That weekend, I finally had a working GPS in my car. All you had to do was ignore the constant suggestions it issued about which pedestrians to run over.</p>

<p>Do you ever feel, you know, not so fresh?</p><p>I know I certainly do, and the weekend in Squamish I spent with half a fifty’s worth of gas station automobile air fresheners jammed in my boxers definitely qualified. It was enough to make a man feel like the sweet deal he got on a thirty year old Ford he pulled out of a swamp wasn’t all that sweet after all.</p><p>The reeking interior couldn’t be merely described as <i>oppressive</i>, oh no; its odour was nearly physically manifest, some kind of dense solid that filled the space between the doors with a truly offensive olfactory experience. It wasn’t until we tried to turn over the car, and the exhaust gas failed to flow from its engine, as if blocked by some unknown force, that we realized just how bad things had gotten.</p><p>Pleas from the gas station peanut gallery about “lighting a match” went unheeded; indeed, no ignition could take place within ten paces of the big-body Panther, the matches merely dissolving against their strike plate into a kind of vapour rather than catching fire. My assistant, Sideways Carl, desperately attempted to spray an aerosol can of Febreze in the general direction of the car, only to have the can in his hand immediately crushed into a molecule-thin singularity and disappear into the air. </p><p>Frantic calls to the customer-support hotline went unreturned, our number eventually blocked as agent after agent shut us down, except for one who remarked, through tears, that we had found the “Overstench” and would pray for our souls.</p><p>Even so, it was pretty cheap, and I never had to worry about it getting stolen. After all, the rotting corpses of those who tried would make it smell slightly better.</p>

<p>As a neurosurgeon, I often get asked if I can tell people where the belief in God resides in the brain. Since I’m not a theologist, I can’t provide any new insight into that, but what I can tell them is exactly how much current you have to provide to the damp earlobes of a six year old in order to make them hear colours.</p><p>At the hospital where I work, there’s a clear pecking order of vehicles. Orderlies and general physical labour drive practical, economical cars such as Hyundais and Lexuses. Management drives showy leases, and the doctors all stuff their parking spaces with hair-trigger sports cars with the temperament of a jilted exotic dancer. Us surgeons, however, are different - and to a man, we prefer the refined perfection of the Porsche line of products.</p><p>Everything is just the way you could ever want it, from the dense <i>whuff</i> of the doors shutting to the split-second pause before the starter leaps to life, stirring the engine into song. The ultimate car. Yet, I found myself in my spare time drawn to more reckless pursuits.

<p>Parking space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of my rusty-ass 1989 Grand Caravan. Its five-year limited powertrain warranty: expired, like its plates. It boldly goes where no K-car has gone before: over twenty-five years since manufacture.</p><p>The Caravan just narrowly scrapes its way in between two parked Rams. I extract myself through the permanently-halfway-down passenger side power window - a Chrysler innovation that persists to the modern era - and head inside through the parking lot. Inside, the denizens of the Home Depot are bustling, competing like the apes they once were to purchase the only unwarped plywood in the tri-county area.</p><p>As I emerge from the Home Depot, I am momentarily panicked by the sight of a group of Ultra-Millennials surrounding my mini-Mopar. Each one of them packs an unreasonable number of razor-sharp LED-infused fidget spinners, and communicates seamlessly with the Allmind through the web of touch sensors embedded beneath their skin. It is a terrifying sight, yet I feel no fear.</p><p>They are here to crowd around my Caravan and show off their own front-wheel-drive 1980s and 1990s minivans. The crowd has destroyed the Rams, torn their bodies apart and immediately parked vans of every description in the spots they once selfishly obscured. I see Voyagers, Grand Voyagers, Aerostars, Windstars - even the mysterious Mercury Villager, spoken of prior to this only in myth.</p><p>The reason for their infatuation is clear. After their parents rebelled against both the station wagon and the minivan in favour of the God-Hated Crossover, these Ultra-Millennials were forced to take the Grand Caravan and its ilk back to purestrain cool. I have inadvertently become “cool,” as the kids say in their gargling, nearly-unrecognizable language of tongue pops and glottal stops.</p><p>Had the German culture survived in this timeline, I know that they would have referred to the sensation I was now experiencing as <i>kleinerbrudersweetminivan</i>, or the feeling of your younger brother putting neons on the family people mover before you can.</p>

<p>A series of dour-faced Germans scatter as the flat-blacked Formula Firebird plows through a display of computer trackballs of the 1980s. With two more flares shouted from the near-vertical pipes of the hood-exit exhaust, the Pontiac lurches to one side, spinning its tires on the high density concrete of the conference centre floor. Nobody can escape the justice that the humble F-body has brought to town.</p><p>I slug the secret factory-ratchet shifter into the next gear to quell the wheelspin for just a moment, and the slaughterhouse-ugly Firebird’s spark-cut bark wobbles out into an angry wail.</p><p>My fun comes to an abrupt end when one of the Germans, perhaps out of some kind of genetic memory, triggers the fire-protection sprinklers. The introduction of any moisture at all to the long-suffering Optispark module stops the sport-appearing Pontiac in its steps.</p><p>I furiously attempt to restart it, hoping beyond hope that perhaps the heat soak from the rusted-off turbocharger heat shields have boiled the Opti dry again. To my chagrin, I realize that the incredible inferno beneath the hood has just seemed to have made the starter worse. I silently resolve never to make fun of aftermarket hood scoops again, or at least not when greater than a hundred yards from a Canadian Tire stick-on rice aisle.</p><p>As the police descend upon my position, I am reduced to leaning out the window and screaming at them, attempting to reassure them that I am in fact a white male and thus have societal privilege that they are duty-bound to uphold.</p><p>“I play golf <i>for charity</i>,” I squeak out before a truncheon is swung against my head and everything goes black.<br/></p>

<p>Once upon a time, we visited another town’s Burger Baron and saw outside it a 1987 Town and Country wagon. Not just any wagon, this model featured prominently the exterior wood grain - Iacoccan in its suburbanite-bourgeois braggadocio - and nothing much left in the way of functional components. This neglected automobile had been stripped for parts in the distant past by either someone affiliated with the management of the Burger Baron or some kind of malevolent organization of Turbo Dodge owners focused on keeping their own hoopties alive well into their fourth decade of existence, legalities be damned.</p><p>We paid our respects to a fallen soldier of automotive excellence, and moved on with our lives. Years later, however, a friend posted his own travel picture from the Baron. There, again, was the K-Car, looking not all that much worse than we had left it. Perhaps there was some inherent merit to this car, some deeper meaning that had evaded us back then. It was decided we would return to the scene and perform an act of forensic journalism.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I know the car,” said the Baron manager. “I never got around to fixing up that piece of shit. Do you want it?”<br/></p><p>It would have been a shame to leave here empty-handed. After all, we had driven so many hours and had to still make a return trip. We might as well have something to show for it. The group deliberated, only momentarily pausing to comment on the fact that a 1991 Hyundai Scoupe GT was an inappropriate tow vehicle. At last we agreed that we would purchase the automobile from the burger-flinging philistine, if only to save it from some future demise at the hands of an errant plow operator on some awful November morning.</p><p>Storage was another problem, but one of our group owned a small burger restaurant, and surely none of his customers would ever notice that one of the cars in his spacious parking lot never moved. It was the perfect plan.</p><p>On the way back, ideas and pledges were thrown around like so many dead bugs from the unfiltered cabin air vents of the little Hyundai. We would put the depressing Chrysler back on the road next weekend. Or weekend after that. Or maybe in the spring. With the storage problem fixed, we had all kinds of time to fix it up right.</p>

<p>Many chirping recruiters have invited me to this speed interviewing event. It is nice for them but I only know Erlang, the computer language and way of life of my Viking ancestors.</p><p>Yes, in Scandinavia it is the only language, I tell the recruiter from slave taxi company. They make us build supervisor trees at school. When a child dies in Scandinavia the parents immediately fuck to replace it, that is why we are incautious about road safety.</p><p>I am moved on to this man who shoots rockets into space and hopes they will come home. I am familiar with coming home, but I know that I can never do so. Back home they give us all rifles, because they know that it is less practical to commit suicide with them. We cannot bear to be impractical, and yet everyone I have ever had sex with has killed themselves when the Frostmourn comes.</p><p>The last man asks how I am. In Scandinavia, nobody asks how you are. They just know. We are all miserable. Our days are a never ending spiral of despair towards an inescapable death. I am not bad. How about you?</p>

<p>Now that all the boomers have passed on, one of the less expected effects was the total and absolute collapse of value in muscle cars. It turns out that after decades of telling the youths that they were too stupid to own a vehicle more complicated than a fidget spinner or novelty meth pipe, and just as many years of looting their wallets for vastly overpriced insulin, nobody could really afford these cars at their inflated value.</p><p>The end result was that I got to pick up a whole heapin’ helpin’ of 60s Chargers for scrap value. What to do with them, I wondered? Freak out the normals, came the only possible answer. Yet no matter how many supermarkets I plowed through, or hotel valets that I turned 305-width R-compounds into lung cancer for, I felt incomplete. Perhaps it was a yearning for my own youth.</p><p>In my time, there had been the Hellcat, the billion-horsepower suicide pill that boomers coveted in the desperate hope of regaining their lost virility. Where had all of those gone? They had run the factories 24/7, pumping out thousands of the things. It was not like they could have just disappeared.</p><p>My network-scanning, artificially-intelligent cyberhounds soon retrieved the terrible truth from the wreckage of the Mopar Allmind. The Hellcat was Dodge’s secret project to <i>kill</i> the boomers, a gleaming, perfect sword for them to fall upon as soon as they flipped off the traction control and told their passengers a story about how they once made twenty-five cents an hour stocking morphine on shelves and <i>they liked it</i>. Casualty projections at the project’s outset were catastrophic. How could they have approved this, I asked myself. For what reason would they murder their customers?</p><p>At the end of one file, I found my reason: Jeep Renegade sales were a little soft that quarter and they felt that the inheritances might cause the younguns to buy a few new ones.</p>

<p>It was like a Thomas Kincaid painting, assuming that Special K took a break from painting trains to render an accurate illustration of a dude in his garage torquing big-end bearings while chain-smoking darts from a box rolled up in his shirt sleeve. Wait, maybe that’s Norman Rockwell. I never showed up to any of my art school classes after I realized I could get credit for welding quarter panels onto beaters “in a deconstruction of the American Dream of single-family automobile ownership.”</p><p>The entire situation was so beautiful that the loan shark goons who entered my garage involuntarily wept a tear. Despite the perfect scene that I had set up, it might also have been because I dumped half a bear can of pepper spray into the air in their general direction as soon as I heard the clattering top-end of their cynically-named High Feature V6 pushing water up my back alley. I did not have time for their suffering, and with nary a wasted gesture moved to crank up the volume dial on my garage stereo, now at last entering the throbbing second hour of the back straight of Spa circa the 1968 GP.</p><p>No quantity of Mexican convenience store amphetamines was too much when it came down to getting this piece of shit running because I have work tomorrow. After all, It was moments like these that were why I ignored the largely uncontrolled water and oil leaks from my various hoopties, and not at all laziness.<br/></p>

<p>Everyone was excited about natural oil, and now so was I. While traditionally, I was more of a synthetic blend kind of guy, ideally milked from the sumps of expensive cars with easily accessible drain plugs, I could understand the crude appeal of a simpler engine oil from times long past.</p><p>Why stop there, I wondered? My neighbourhood, which had gone from “aspirational” to “successful” to “underachieving,” was certainly ripe for its own kind of milking. Rich folks wandered the streets openly, no longer afraid for their lives from threatening ethnicities or any economic ideologies described outside of the Austrian school. It was the perfect backdrop.</p><p>Welcome to my oil change <i>palais</i>, friends. Here, you will leave your car with one of our talented valets, their supple hands tenderized every morning by a team of specialist eunuchs so that they dare not scratch your steering wheel with the callouses common to other mechanics.</p><p>Come upstairs, and enjoy complimentary hot yoga and a visit with our life coach, who will affirm your worldview and locate the core of your spirit essence. We don’t just fix your car here, you see, we fix the <i>drivers</i> as well. Just with fewer Fram filters, ideally, though we pride ourselves on being non-judgmental in this way. Our team of monks sealed into constant chants of prayer for your economic success and psychosexual well-being are in no way denominational, of course.</p><p>As you leave the parking lot, your car’s oil and your life both changed by your brief contact with us, I will run my hands through the four digits of hot American currency you left in my hands for the privilege. Won’t you visit Essence Of Oil Change today?</p>

<p>As they lowered my body into the sensory deprivation tank, the last thing I saw was the face of my mentor, who smiled and told me not to tell anyone I was from the future. All was dark after that, except for the part where I travelled back in time to 1970, to try and stop the Chevrolet Vega from reaching the shores of America and dooming our society to the dustbin of history.</p><p>At first, the engineers from General Motors did not understand my barking about dissimilar metals in heads, or the low-quality assembly, or the rust-prone panels. These things would work themselves out because the American people would pay less for such a car, they explained patiently, as if to some kind of small child that had taught itself enough mechanical engineering to second-guess a General Motors chassis-fucker.</p><p>How could I tell them that even now as we spoke, the Japanese were preparing to atom-bomb them with a one-two punch of exotic grand tourers and dumpy hatchbacks that got astounding fuel economy and never broke? After all, I could not tell them of the future, or could I? Within minutes, it became obvious to me. I would simply show them <i>a better way</i>.</p><p>“Check this shit out,” I announced at the Chevrolet engineering company barbeque, before departing and returning in a tire-smoking Corvair, stuffed to the gills with a cammed 327 sticking out of its ass. “Who needs <i>economy</i> in a small car?” I screamed over the sound of the open ports venting hellfire into the once-placid Sunday afternoon.<br/></p><p>Within minutes, GM had thrown out the plans for the Vega, told Opel to take a hike, and began production of my V8 Corvair. As the world faded and I returned to my own time in the sensory deprivation tank, I knew at once that I had made a terrible mistake.</p><p>In the parking lot outside the laboratory, where rows of Toyota Priuses once stood, all had been replaced by ass-engined V8 Tacoma truggies, the asphalt coated in an impenetrable mass of smouldering R-compound rubber. Above us, a smog-choked sky was laced with immense lightning storms, the sun no longer visible.</p><p>“Good job not being a pussy,” said my mentor, somehow aware of the completion of my mission. “This shit rules.”<br/></p>

<p>Like most Russians, my friend Dmitri is made mostly of razors and expired shoeshine polish. Unlike most Russians, however, he has never killed anyone for a minor traffic offence, nor does he drive a diamond-encrusted Porsche Cayenne whose interior is described in the brochure as being made of “genuine whale penis.” What he does have is an abiding love for eight cylinders in a tightly packed vee-arrangement, and the more pushrods the better.</p><p>“Bring back the V8! Your leaders let the V8 die and so must your country. I have seen it before!” he is shrieking into a megaphone when I approach.</p><p>“It’s almost time for lunch, Dmitri. Let’s go get some Subway diarrhea melts.”</p><p>He grudgingly complies, only after I make the offer that I will pay for his sandwich. Soon, we find ourselves standing before the creature spoken of in myth as a Sandwich Artist, contemplating our many mistakes in life. After we sit down, it becomes obvious to me that Dmitri has failed to leave his work at the curb.</p><p>“You know, when they started with the V6, that is when things went wrong in America,” says he with a finger jab out the window at a passing Ford, shaking lettuce free from his oven-warmed Ham and Cheese Spectacle. He settles back in the chair, consumed with rage at the very thought of the Iraqi oil fire that is V8 fuel efficiency meeting the braying discomfort of the Hated Double-Three.</p><p>When we return to the corner a few minutes later, something is wrong. Somehow, Dmitri’s primo ranting real estate is under a contest that I could not possibly have imagined. In his place is another man, barking his own engine fondness into a near-identical megaphone.</p><p>“Bring back the rotary engine! Five miles per gallon is enough for anybody!” yells the new man on the corner, unheeded by the four-cylinder Corollas eternally rolling past.<br/></p>

<p>They told us that the electric cars would solve global warming, that they would keep our children happy and healthy. They said it would even stop war, but from my perspective, no such thing was occurring at the corner of Fourth and Main, where the city had placed its first free electric-vehicle charging spot.</p><p>For weeks, I had been obsessed with it, contemplating it day and night. I found myself staring directly at it whenever I had lunch at the little cafe across the street. The concept was compelling.</p><p>If you got free gas from the government, you’d be over the moon. Here it was just out in the open, for anyone to take, as long as they had an electric car. I set a reminder in my phone to buy a Nissan Leaf as soon as I could find one for under a thousand bucks. It would seem, however, that even less-tightwads than myself had already ordered their electric cars. Two of them were having a fistfight right now, upon arriving at the exact same moment for the only free charger in town.</p><p>The Tesla owner, as could be expected from his higher socioeconomic position due likely to a history of exploitation of workers, opened up with a haymaker before attempting negotiation. That antagonized the Spark owner, who snapped the charge cable like a whip at the Tesla driver. Soon, both men were circling each other, knives drawn.</p><p>While initially my socialist/cheap-ass instincts had slotted me in the camp against the Tesla-driving gentleman, I soon determined through a quick Google search that the Spark EV was in fact a Chevrolet product. It was a wash, for sure.</p><p>Soon, the police arrived, barking the sirens of their cruisers. This antagonized both combatants, who immediately accused the police officers of hating the planet with their low-output V8 gas guzzlers. Didn’t they care about the children, they shrieked while being beaten to a bloody pulp by the cops’ carbon-fibre extendable batons.</p><p>Myself, I was just glad that I wasn’t down at the DMV when these two showed up to order smug electricity-pun personalized license plates.</p>

<p>“Do you swear fealty only to the One True Car, the Chrysler Intrepid, and to no lesser four-door semi-luxury sedans?” asked the cultist at the other end of the snaking obsidian dagger pointed at my heart.<br/></p><p>I wanted to ask what happened to the 300M Special, but decided that discretion was the better part of valour in this circumstance. Another better part of valour was my loaded .38 snubnose, from which I discharged hollowpoint justice into the hooded teenager with a quick one-two brap. As he sagged to the ground, the audience went wild, perhaps not yet realizing the gun wasn’t loaded with blanks for their entertainment.</p><p>When I was first approached about attending ChryslerCon and taking part in the Early 90s FWD Paradise panel, I figured that they had finally called my number, identified my cries for help as closeted lust for the Dodge Neon. It was not to be, I would soon find - my fellow panelists, like the cultist, were consumed altogether by some kind of strange power that brought their attentions solely on Iacocca’s Revenge, the Cloud Car of lore.</p><p>Choosing to seize the moment and build on the momentum that taking a human life had given me, I grabbed my microphone and leaned in conspiratorially. I was going to say something <i>controversial</i>, the crowd realized, and their murmuring about whether or not to call the homicide police fell silent, now hanging on my every word. In my peripheral vision, I could see my fellow panelists, too, were enraptured, drawn from their study of Mopar Action back-issues by the report of the handgun.</p><p>“How can you make a good front-wheel-drive car if the engine is installed <i>longitudinally</i>?” I spat into the mic, before hooking my belt loop to the dangling tow rope and letting the helicopter pull me from the hall before the crowd could rush me in delusional anger.</p><p>It was only as I ascended through the opened skylight of the Cobo Centre, giving the assembled crowd a furious double-bird that I began to feel regret. I had neglected to pick up an ACR radio delete panel from the swap meet, and now it would just be awkward to go back.</p>

<p>On my first day as a traffic reporter, I had already crossed the line from reporting on the news to being part of the news. Luckily for me, with all the anger towards the media these days, the station lawyers had finally relented and given us a whole heapin’ helpin’ of leeway as far as it came to self defense, and I was feeling very much on the defensive right now.</p><p>“I have a medical condition,” I barked into the headset mic, hoping that the lure of salacious gossip about The Traffic Helicopter Guy would compel the station management to keep me on the air. “That medical condition is being sick of this bullshit.” With that, I uncorked the station’s M-42 grenade launcher I brought with me, and coughed a ball of anti-materiel hellfire directly into that fucking traffic light which always dicks me over on the little left turn arrow.</p><p>The viewers loved it - the explosive Nielsen-rating collars strapped to our necks began bleeping <i>happy</i> tones, as opposed to the depressed warble-screams they sometimes emitted whenever Old Les the Alky Weatherman mispronounced the name of our city. My pilot looked over at me, and gave me the universal thumbs-up of approval. Hollywood and police movies had taught the normal American family that there was a Greater Power, and right now a stop-and-go psychotic farting grenades out of a Bell Jet Ranger was putting on one hell of a sermon.</p><p>My next target would be important, the management barked into the shrieking walnut-sized earpiece stuffed directly into my aural cavity. You have to pick something that <i>matters</i>, something that people hate.</p><p>“Take me to the FedEx office, motherfucker,” I barked at the pilot, to more excited bleeping from the collar. “I got a <i>special delivery</i> to drop off.”<br/></p>

<p>Working a grift in an old folks home is surprisingly tiring. On the face of it, the math works out: they don’t have a lot of energy to resist and scamming them takes almost zero effort. My grift, though, depends on <i>volume</i>, and that’s where they get you. Each sobbing retiree who clutches a picture of their granddaughter’s maid and tells me about how ethnic her hair is wears me down just a little bit more.</p><p>Some days, I don’t even have the energy to trick them into signing the bill of sale so I can take their luxury car out of their ownership before they hurt someone. On those kinds of days, I will flee to the nearest bathroom, stare into the mirror, and remind myself that I am a <i>job creator</i>. I am encouraging the flow of hoopties from their natural origin at old-folks’ homes to their natural destination of aspirational neighbourhoods, and along the way it’s only fair that I pocket a few thousand dollars for my trouble.</p><p>Occasionally, I have a rival: another smooth-voiced operator who decides that a little bit of styling gel and a vaguely Spanish accent is all the prep he’s going to need in order to bilk money out of these olds and send it to “starving children.” He has so far refused to descend from his Heavenly throne to this very mortal firmament, however, and the cats-paws he sends to enforce his will are generally poor at looking out behind them or not falling out of windows. It’s hard to find good help these days, and that’s why I do my Caddy-grabbin’ by myself.</p><p>I hadn’t expected the greatest obstacle to my plans, however: the local political animals. They appear with a short bus and ten gallon hat, smiling the entire time, promising to gas-chamber every teenager if only they can count on them for a little donation, and more importantly, their vote. I can’t afford to give them matching free casino trips, what with all the Northstar head gaskets I’ve been buying, and so when these gangs of feral politicos show up, I have to simply hit the tracks before Johnny Law decides I look a little too poor to be living somewhere with golf carts for public transport.</p><p>It’s a hard grift, but it’s an honest one. It’s not like I’m selling pension funds or anything.</p>

<p>“Sir, we must politely ask you to refrain from hooking up a nitrous oxide system at the exact same time you are filling out rental paperwork promising not to do such a thing,” whined the Master Beaters lot attendant, no doubt re-re-thinking his cousin’s offer to bump a shitload of heroin this morning instead of going to work.<br/></p><p>“I have a medical condition,” I explained.<br/></p><p>This kind of thing always happened when I was forced to rent a car; due to the tireless efforts of the ocean industry and their capture of regulatory authorities, overseas travel almost never allowed me to bring my own car with me. And that wasn’t even counting the several countries that had outright banned any of my soggy-bodied Pick N Pull crusher rejects.</p><p>Like it or not, I was at their mercy, unless I wanted to do something crazy like ride public transit. The problem there was that despite being a lever of Big Government, the crypto-Communist institution also almost never equipped buses with nitrous oxide, which (as previously stated) was required for my medical condition. It’s a renewable fuel, assholes, I kept telling them during my many letter-writing campaigns to the members of the United Nations. There’s nitrogen <i>everywhere</i>.</p><p>Despite the unpleasantness, I soon found myself freed of the lot attendant, who returned to his small heated cubicle at the corner of the lot and pointedly ignored me as I hooked up the nitrous anyway.</p><p>There were two constants in life, I used to tell the preschool class I taught before the prison sentence: one, that no car was ever “fast enough,” and two, that nobody really gave a shit about anything you do as long as you didn’t do it to their face.</p>

<H1>Roger & Meth Injection</H1>
<p>Roger got appointed head ringleader of the circus in 1981. He was too late to have stopped it. There’s a funny thing that happens when a man achieves his goal; almost without exception, he finds that what he lost along the way had been more important the whole time.</p><p>His first day, they took him down to the place where everything had gone wrong. Lordstown. He despised Ohio, hated the stench of it, how the reek of its secret evil had almost a carnal <i>texture</i>. The part of Lordstown Assembly Roger had witnessed in the past, however, was not the one that he was being taken to now, by two masked men in the standard General Motors business suit of ill-fitting navy.</p><p>“We made a mistake,” said the taller of the two, before an angry glance from the other silenced his words. Loose talk and poor self-control is what had gotten them into every other mess, Roger somehow knew. How could this one be different?</p><p>In the room stood a man among corpses, their outstretched hands to a man marked with a sigil. Roger dimly remembered seeing the tattoo before, on the left hand of the man who had been picked before his time to run Pontiac.</p><p>The man began to speak, without turning to meet Roger’s gaze. While a powerful businessman in the rest of the world, Roger Smith did not become the President of General Motors by speaking out of turn. For some unexplained reason, he was beginning to suspect that his powers had reached their limit here, borne as they were from man’s folly.</p><p>General Motors’ powerful warlocks could not hold the seal that morning, the man explained, not pausing to check if Smith comprehended his words. Something escaped when they were harvesting the exotic turbocharger technology from the eccentric foreigner they had captured. There was simply too much boost, and our men could not have known what would happen.</p><p>The fluorescent shop lights stirred to life, keyed on by one of the men who had brought Roger to this cursed place. Now he could see everything. The burned rubber marks, forming a pentagram upon the shop floor. Extinguished factory-surplus road flares littered around the room, as if blown loose from a sharp gust. Hanging on the wall, tinted black with overrich exhaust soot, a blueprint. <i>The</i> blueprint.</p><p>“The Trans Am Turbo is your problem now, Roger,” said the man, addressing Smith directly for the first and last time. “Financials won’t be the only loss if we can’t get this buttoned up.”<br/></p>

<p>You’d think, as I did, that being chief reporter for a magazine read predominantly by teenage girls waiting in abortion clinics would be difficult. My time writing for <i>Motor Trend</i>, however, was anything but.</p><p>“We’ve determined that the only articles people ever read are inflammatory ones, about bad cars,” my interviewer said. “We want to pick up what <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> is putting down.”<br/></p><p>Over the next few weeks, I converted my handsome senior journalist salary of medium-low five figures into a desk drawer full of malt liquor, and spun through my predecessor’s Rolodex in search of free parts so fast that it caught fire. After that, there was only the matter of the cover car. I chose wisely, but others didn’t feel the same way, as the next month’s letters section indicated.</p><p>“Dear Sirs,” started the letter in a nasal tone, “Your so-called ‘feature’ of the 2003 MG XPower SV missed several of its key features, and it is by no means a ‘bad car’ just because it occasionally catches fire and looks like a tangerine that has been pushed through the accessories department of a Pep Boys.”<br/></p><p>I was barely through reading the article, when my desk phone rang. After several minutes of Googling about how to operate a phone, I was able to successfully pick it up. It was The Brass, and they were extremely unhappy about some kind of boycott that the MG Club of America was putting on.</p><p>They’re the only people who still buy <i>Motor Trend</i>, the distorted voice on the other side explained to me. Well, those and the Jaguar guys, but most of those people are dead and their estates hold the subscription. We’re sorry, but you can no longer make fun of Chinese-owned Italian-made Ford-engined British sports coupes within our pages.</p><p>I was made to make an apology, and kicked to the curb. But my time at the magazine had not been for naught; it turned out that the mailroom clerk was a huge fan of <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i> and knew how to set up a forwarding address for all those free parts I had begged for.</p><p>As my home office filled up with free performance goodies, I couldn’t help but notice that Edelbrock included the XPower SV in their applications list. Maybe I’d buy one; all that negative press surely had knocked down the price by now.</p>

<p>It sure wasn’t easy, but with the help of a gypsy seamstress who I plied with malt liquor and the occasional threat of violence, I’d successfully re-upholstered every piece of furniture in my house with Bride gradation fabric. I leaned back into my couch, feeling the plush opulence of authentic JDM greyscale enveloping me like a perfect blanket.</p><p>From this position, I could see into my backyard. Through the ragged hole left from last May when I tried to stow an unregistered Baja in the backyard quickly before the 5-0 came back, I could see my neighbour Tom, admiring the fantastic fabric work I had done. He hoisted to one shoulder a nondescript tube, in olive drab. Before I could duck, he was able to lob a knockout-gas grenade directly through the shattered remnants of my kitchen window, ricocheting it off the stack of Speedline wheels I had piled in the corner.</p><p>When I came to, I knew immediately that he had come after Francesca. What terrible things would he do to her? I ran through what I knew about Tom, before realizing with a start that he was a BMW aficionado. I charged out into the backyard, wielding an Autobacs baggie full of genuine squash-flavoured Air Spencers as a crude flail. I was too late.</p><p>Tom’s house, a formerly decrepit bungalow stuffed to the gills with brake parts, now boasted the Recaro confetti pattern fabric on every wall. I had to admit it looked a little more fun than mine, and regretted, not for the first time, passing up the HKS drag-car neon camo.</p>

<p>It feels good to give back to society. For the last few weeks, I’ve been volunteering my time to help those less fortunate. Sure, they had made a few mistakes along the way, but which of us can honestly say they have not? These gentle folks got caught, landed themselves in a heap of trouble. It’s all a decent man can do is offer a helping hand up.</p><p>Yes, I was teaching a course on remedial drivers’ ed. Every Thursday at the Learning Annex, the cops would shuffle yet another batch of shitty drivers into my waiting arms. They’d get a PowerPoint presentation of the usual rules of the road, and then we’d do what I liked to call a “driving simulator” that actually consisted of them driving me to the grocery store and waiting outside until I was done figuring out what the cheapest whisky was this week. This road test, naturally, was where most of my students fell down.</p><p>I couldn’t save them all. The more aggressive students would work their way out of the system no matter what I did, whether it be from partial decapitation by guardrail, or the more common plunging of their pickup truck into a gas station while carrying burning firewood in the bed. It was my duty to focus on those I could save, the merely inadequate as drivers. Despite the schools’ and television commercials’ best efforts at promoting a healthy self-image, many of these drivers were simply terrified to be behind the wheel.</p><p>Nobody else, it seemed, was willing to stick a high-voltage eBay tazer between their ribs and start pulling the trigger every time the speedo needle dipped below twenty over.</p>

<p>For weeks now, some terrible fiend had been harassing local politicians by throwing uncooked hot dogs on the hood of their parked cars. When they finally called me out of retirement to take a look at the investigation, I figured they had hit the ends. It would later turn out that the byproducts were what was important all along.</p><p>I met with Detective Sam Reno at the latest scene. He rejected my initial offer of coffee, possibly because he was busy carefully picking up a wiener with his pen and transferring it to an evidence bag. He paused, sniffed at it.</p><p>“Kosher,” he muttered to himself, and with a hand signal, ordered two of his men to begin questioning the rabbi.</p><p>“What do you think is the intent here?” I asked, trying to juggle the two insanely hot cups of coffee. I should have gotten a cardboard sleeve, I realized. It’s not like I could just put it down, either. The gravel parking lot was super mucky and I’d get the cup all gross where you hold it with your finger. There was no excuse for fucking up this badly, not at this level. Reno didn’t notice the beads of sweat rolling down my face and told me his theory.<br/></p><p>“We think it’s a plot to make wild bears attack the mayor,” he said, stone faced. “Attempted murder.”</p><p>I asked some more questions, wrote down the answer. He told me that they were operating under the theory that there was only one killer. “Methods are consistent - uncooked, 100% All Beef, non-ballpark American style frank.”</p><p>He thought briefly that there might have been a change in the suspect’s M.O., perhaps an escalation of behaviour as he continued to evade justice. “It turned out to be a piece of leftover firewood,” he explained sheepishly. It would all be in the case notes, he assured me, as he made haste for his second part-time job at the bingo parlour. Cops didn’t get paid much in this town, because the criminals didn’t have any money to bribe them with, explained my lieutenant when I had first joined the force. Saves the taxpayers a shitload.</p><p>After Detective Reno left, overly cooled free coffee in hand (for which I received no thanks), I worked the scene for awhile. I could tell he didn’t care for having a new detective on the case, but there was no denying that sometimes you just plain missed something. For instance, I missed the curb, and tripped onto the road. Not a road. A bicycle lane. Ahead of me, a Cannondale sped forward, blind to the presence of my prone body. At these speeds, a man could be decapitated instantly. I had seen it with my own two eyes, during the Tour De Severed Head Case.</p><p>At that very moment, a hand grasped me, and pulled me upright. I didn’t recognize the man, but he had kind eyes. My luck continued as he told me he had a hot tip on the case.</p><p>“Check out the hot dog salesman in town,” he said, “there’s only one, and he hates the mayor.”<br/></p>

<p>When I started with the FBI, I figured I would be chasing down perps, shaking out the truth, maybe even covering up some alien conspiracies. Wearing a suit, driving a twenty year old body-on-frame official car, giving thumbs up to the quirky small-town folk that I meet before getting pulled in to their secret vigilante justice organization. Those were the things I wanted from an FBI career, but the career wanted something else.</p><p>My first day, I sat down in a meeting with my boss. She tented her fingers, and pushed a piece of paper across the desk. At the top of it, just below the FBI letterhead, immense gothic type reading “MINNESOTA THEORY” made up the header.</p><p>“What is this?” I sputtered, reaching onto my belt to feel for the nonexistent service weapon I had not yet received, as if shooting a piece of paper with hollow point nine millimeter could make this discovery go away.<br/></p><p>“We here at the Bureau cannot officially confirm or deny the existence of the state of Minnesota,” she said, leaning back in the plush leather of her chair. “Nobody we’ve sent there has ever returned.”</p><p>I told them it was ludicrous, that all I needed was a fast car and a catheter and I would prove it to them. Then I started heading west. Many hours of driving later, I saw a state border sign for Minnesota, tattered and rusted, as if it had been forgotten decades ago and nobody was around to take care of it. I kept driving, but a few minutes later, I arrived at the border of South Dakota. That’s weird, I thought, I must have fallen asleep at the wheel and completely missed Minnesota altogether.</p><p>Kicking the handbrake, I pulled a u-ey and drove the way I had come. Again, I appeared at the strange Minnesota limit sign, travelling into Wisconsin. This didn’t make any sense. Minnesota had to exist, it had to. I looked up into the sky, which had suddenly darkened. The moon was out. I frantically pushed the “CLOCK” button on my dashboard, which told me that my trip through “Minnesota” had taken several hours, none of which I remembered.</p><p>Back at my humble apartment, I got some cheese from the fridge. On the label, it said “Made in Minnesota.” I furrowed my brow, and when I unwrapped the cheese, it had already gone rancid in the package, as if it was thousands of years old.<br/></p><p>At FBI headquarters, they reviewed my dashcam footage. The SD card was corrupt. My colleagues shook their heads, despairing at having to file yet another report that the theory of Minnesota being an actual state that exists was still inconclusive.</p>

<p>Who can truly know the mind of the Corvette owner? Their mental patterns are so unlike ours. Through a life of grand touring indulgence, their bodies have become weak and their minds prone to flights of fancy. Our society must now come together to determine a way to protect ourselves from the threat of Corvette owners.</p><p>Scientists at the Academy For Motorcar Shit Talking today identified that more 1996 automatic Neons have been raced than Corvettes of any kind. Corvette Racing head Bill Understeer went on record telling us, quote, &ldquo;Shit&rsquo;s slow,&rdquo; end quote.</p><p>Doctors at the Institute For Cars That Only Middle-Aged Real Estate Speculators Drive indicate that they may someday have a cure for the Corvette, emboldened by the successful vaccination drive of 2008, which all but eliminated the eleventh-generation Ford Thunderbird.</p>

<p>“Can you play ‘slightly overweight braggart?’” my agent asked me, barely looking up from her morning heroin. “Says here that some show about cars is hiring a temporary one because the real one punched out another assistant.”<br/></p><p>I thought about it for about three seconds, because that was the amount of time it took for her to get to the “pay scale” section of the want ad. Then I leapt for it, becoming the world’s newest and most beloved motoring presenter, along two other guys and a man who doesn’t talk much and lives entirely in a race helmet. Problems with race would dog me throughout my engagement, so I should have seen that as more of an omen than I did.</p><p>My first day at work was going great. I had a fantastic rapport with the fans, I was able to crack jokes while powersliding, and I won the bad car challenge because I remembered the old adage: Hondas never die. By all means, my rise should have been meteoric. Then came the race incident.</p><p>During the news segment, a mention of F1 racing came up. I immediately pretended to play dead until the other two were done talking about it, but eventually a producer prodded me from offstage and I was forced to make a comment on it.</p><p>“You know it’s all fake, right? Like professional wrestling,” I said, leaning forward in my jean jacket for maximum emphasis. From this position, they told me, I was the audience’s friend, like a boorish chap down the pub who fancied a pint. I understood almost nothing of what they told me, but went along with it in a sort of crude parroting of their actions until they walked away and left me to my devices.</p><p>The audience crackled with rage. Suddenly, there were pitchforks and torches, and even the mandatory attractive women in the first row were mad at me. Somehow I had miscalculated, and spending hours of your life watching fantasy penis-cars dully slide around the playgrounds of the ultra-rich was now the height of motorsport.</p><p>When I woke up the next morning, I had received a message telling me my services were no longer needed. I’m not entirely sure why they had to decapitate a Stig and leave his head in my bed, though.</p>

<p>When you’re the best, every second matters. You can’t have a bunch of rookies in your pit who don’t know which way their ratchet has to be set to loosen. They need to know every ounce of leverage, to identify metric fasteners from across the room without even looking in their direction. When time is money, the best of the best mechanics came to train at my Wrench War Games.</p><p>The first day is easy, but you’d be surprised how many so-called pros will have a panic attack and shit their pants at the very sight of a Lexus LS400 starter job. Those who can finish it, and do it <i>under book</i>, are already the best of the best at their shops, dealerships, Mafia-operated vehicle chopping operations, but they want to be the best in the world. That’s where day two comes in.</p><p>Awoken with a bucket of cold water, my trainees are pushed into the fight of their lives. Through chicanery and nightmare grade levels of Soviet research chemicals, I have managed to assemble the largest known fleet of Maserati Biturbos. They will do an in-car head gasket job, and they will do it under book. Survivors are elevated to Godhood, by which I mean they change a steering rack in a Lancia Delta Integrale. During this time, a team of trained actors recreate various customer breakdowns and rage-fits in the front shop, trying their hardest to throw the so-called real mechanics off their game.</p><p>Only once has a man overcome this gauntlet and still wished for more pain. I looked into his eyes, and I saw the fire of youth burning within. The edge of my lip curled upwards into a grin as I condemned him with one final verdict, a challenge so brutal no man could escape.</p><p>“Replace a water pump in this SR20 Sentra,” I told him, and then burst into maniacal laughter. He’s still there, years later, his fingers eternally pinched between the fender and passenger side upper motor mount, straining to thread in a bolt that will never find grip. We call him Mister Glycol.<br/></p>

<p>Me, I tried to stay out of politics. But once the discussion around the shattered 350 motor we were keeping our beer inside turned to which type of antiseize was superior, I was considering speed-dialing my Senator to see how soon we could get some kind of death camp spun up.</p><p>It wasn’t that my position was the all-knowing, correct one - it was just that the nickel kind was cheap and ninety nine percent of the time you really didn’t want to use antiseize on brake parts anyway, certainly not slide pins - but that the other guy’s was plain wrong. The longer we debated, the harder it became for me to see his viewpoint.</p><p>Soon, the both of us were airing out our grievances in a terrible proxy war on the op-ed pages of the national news media. An endless line of bowtied conservative representatives were all too happy to die on the sword of my so-called friend’s bourgeois waste of copper antiseize, whereas I was able to source a loose handful of greasy, crusty artistic types who appreciated my thrift and ability to make a lot of roach clips from the contents of my junk fastener bin.</p><p>Soon, as our argument wore on, it emerged from the shadowy office coolers of policy wonks to the consciousness of the voting public. There, bands of confused randoms declared themselves “undecided” on this critical issue of workshop integrity. Soon, too many of them fell under the sway of my enemy at highly-funded rallies where the Permatex representatives promised them that their magical copper Cheez Whiz could prevent galvanic corrosion. Poppycock!</p><p>After my friend became President, we both realized the mistake we had made. He cast out to try and issue an olive branch, make me Vice President, but our radicalized supporters on each side could abide no such mild treachery. We would have our garage sessions from then on without President Expensive-Ass Copper Bullshit.</p><p>That worked for me, because in all this hysteria I had grown to like the stuff, and he left like a full canister behind that he was simply too busy to use.</p>

<p>Just the other day I was down at the docks, and I saw the most wonderful thing. An Isuzu Elf, imported fresh from its ancestral homeland of Mother Nippon, was working a miniature hydraulic crane to pick up an engine for a tugboat. If I had such a vehicle, I realized, I would have an engine crane <i>anywhere I wanted</i>. Nobody would be able to stop me: exotics trapped in stop-and-go traffic would be powerless against me opening their hoods and removing their precious still-running engines.</p><p>I thought back to what that old fortune teller at the carnival had told me so many years ago. She said that one day, Isuzu would call on me, and I must be ready. When I saw Isuzu sink and disappear from the US market without a trace, I chalked it up to the malleability of fate itself. That’s the thing about fate, though: you never really can get away from it forever.</p><p>Where could I get an Isuzu Elf of my own? My usual contacts in Japan had gone to ground, asserting in both English and flawless Nipponese (for the benefit of the assorted intelligence agencies) that they would like a large pepperoni pizza and to please hold the bitter melon. Cowards, I said into the receiver while filling out a few more names for later on my infamous Enemies List.</p><p>After a few more hours of calling, I could feel panic rising in my throat, the sensation that I might have to wait a few hours more in order to get exactly what I want. That’s when my friendly Icelandic contact, Gunnbjörn, told me that he had just the thing, tied up in the back. As is my custom, I agreed without thinking about it too hard, transferred the money and waited patiently at the docks for the arrival of my Elf.</p><p>Soon, the stevedores called me in to their office. They had found my shipment, they explained, and took me into a small room. I was confused. Sure, the Isuzu Elf was small, but this box was barely five feet long. There was no way that my crane-clad diesel vixen could be within such a thing. Plus, there was this <i>smell</i>.</p><p>Steve the Stevedore (my name for him; I think he was named Robert or something) popped open the lid with a wrecking bar, and then we all stared inside it. A small body of some creature laid within, humanoid except for its horrible, pointed ears and pinched face. It was naked, save for a stocking cap, and covered in bloody scars from trying to claw its way out of the box. From the look of it, it had been dead for the majority of the journey.</p><p>I resolved from then on to speak more clearly on the phone.</p>

<p>Getting political was one thing, but getting political <i>by doing burnouts</i>? When the community organizer told me about it, I shook his hand so quickly that wads of eccentric Greek billionaire gold bullion fell from his sleeves. There was no time to apologize, though - I was struck by inspiration.</p><p>The next few months were a bit of a blur, but soon I was happily ripping giant smoke clouds in the parking lot of the Georgia Comic Convention. Me and the General Sherman, a Union Blue ‘68 Charger which shot four-foot flames, had been doing alternate-history cosplay up and down the entire South for weeks now.</p><p>There were haters, of course, and they were going to hate, as was their prerogative. I was able to shut them up regardless by doing a four-alarm peel-out while barking something about how they themselves already lived in an alternate reality, so my transgressions were minimal by comparison.</p><p>It wasn’t until later that someone told me that Georgia was also a <i>country</i>. I had been tearing ass up and down Eastern Europe instead of the Southern United States. It figured, I thought the bystanders looked a little too diverse.</p>

<p>I remember fifty percent off weekend. It was the weekend that I became a man, and by the following Monday I wanted nothing more in the world than to forget what I had done. We left men - friends - behind, because there was nothing we could do for them.</p><p>There’s this recurring nightmare I have, it’s of fifty percent off weekend at the yard. There’s this guy, and I don’t know if I ever caught his face, and he’s lifting a 2200 SFI over his head while hooting about finally being able to get the moonshine mobile working. Thing is, a 2200 SFI can look a lot like a primo F22A1, and one of those roving wolverine gangs of Honda Teens were alerted to his presence. He just made too much noise, cracked under the pressure, just like his ribcage when those teens got onto him with their never-used 13mm box-end crescents. A god damn shame. I’ll never forget it.</p><p>When we made that last run for the gold, arms laden with swaybars and a too-disorganized toolbag flapping off my shoulder, I knew that I was turning my back on the last of my humanity. I stole a man’s wheelbarrow, something I swore that I would never do, just to stay one step ahead of the real pros. One of those guys catches up to you at a car, you’re going to see the whole thing disappear into his toolbag and pockets, leaving you with just the bolt you were loosening so slowly.</p><p>This kind of thing affects the staff worst of all. They can’t just decide to go home or not turn up in the morning, like I could. It was my battleground, but it was their home. I still feel bad about stealing over a hundred pounds of relays in the fake lining of my overalls.</p>

<p>“The Lizard People are coming to steal our spiritual essence,” shrieked my esteemed opponent in this, the third episode of the local public broadcaster’s debate series.  I had the perfect rejoinder, one that I expected would leave him reeling against the metaphorical (and actual: we shared a set with the local wrestling program) ropes.<br/></p><p>“But what <i>cars</i> do they drive?” I asked, gesturing loosely with my cigarette holder before giving a Groucho Marx eyebrow wiggle and leaning onto the lectern with the leather-patched elbow of my sport jacket. The moderator began to whoop, circling his fist in the air as if preparing to throw an invisible lasso.<br/></p><p>“The Scion tC,” he said, as if the response had been practiced. I was thrown for a loop, staggered. It was the perfect answer, and as my mind raced through his logic, searching desperately for a hole, I could tell that I was burning valuable airtime, and yet was unable to strike back.</p><p>“B-but they’re <i>boring</i>,” I blubbered, the camera no doubt picking up every high-definition sweat drop that was beading upon my flustered forehead. Lizard people, in a Celica For Oldmos? It made too much sense. I couldn’t lose like this; my pride must survive even if the truth would be obscured.</p><p>I quickly thumbed my smartphone beneath the podium, out of view of the roving camera, while my opponent calmly stated his points of opinion. “Think about it,” he barked at the end, “no person you know owns one. It is only a car that <i>other people</i> drive. Lizard people.”</p><p>Just as he punched the air in a rhetorical flourish, to signify his victory over me as those other brave gladiators of the squared circle we stood in, the doors to the studio burst inwards with a flash and smoke. The “On Air” light winked off, the rest of the world unable to witness the Deep State arriving to cart my enemy away. As he was carried to the parking lot, I decided to sneak a quick peek at what they were driving.</p><p>Mitsubishi Tritons. Of <i>course</i>. Who would reasonably own one of those?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the carnival of the night,&rdquo; shrieks the cashier at Goth Dominos. Ever since the pizza wars blew past the boundaries of good taste, drove through a guard rail and plunged off a cliff into the freezing water of ironic detachment, every restaurant in town capable of bolting red sauce to a spinning disc was mainlining every internet trend and meme as fast as the Allmind could manufacture them. </p><p>It was sort of terrifying, but terrifying in the way where you have to think about it for a while before the cold grasp of fear reaches out for your heart, so most people just giggled and took selfies in front of the Pizza Hut Confederate Memorial. I could hardly blame them. They were pretty busy redecorating their own restaurants multiple times per day, after all. They simply could not afford a mindshare gap. </p><p>“Can I interest you in some Cinnamon Sticks of Ultimate Misery?” she asked, more bored than I thought anyone could ever be. I figured I might as well make my order, and asked for the Consumed Nest of Pepperoni Nightmares.<br/></p><p>“I’m sorry?” blinked the cashier, now wearing an anatomically correct bumblebee costume, 3D printed in seconds from some unseen device. “This is a Honey Fried Ultradominos now.”<br/></p>

<p>A man with little restraint can often get carried away with modifying his car. How many Preludes have you seen chopped into the weeds, outfitted with booming sound systems and day-glow mangorangellow paint? It all comes from someone who doesn’t know when to stop. In that heady mode, where the limits of his taste have become apparent to all around him, he remains oblivious. And yet there is method in this madness, or at least metal.</p><p>My horrible tale begins when I had to fix a minor problem with a daily-driver beater. In my way, an exhaust header. Hateful things, prone to rust and dents and other unfun things. Soon, a cutting wheel had dispensed with the header, and a flawless Chinesium-American™ stainless steel 4-2-1 masterpiece took its place. I finished my work, but then realized a small bit of wear on the rear quarter panel, in amongst all the terminal rust. That wouldn’t do.</p><p>Weeks later, I rolled a silhoutte racer of a Pontiac Sunfire out of the garage, burping flame from its side-exit exhaust, barely visible in amongst its gleaming carbon-fibre widebody. With every breath on the throttle, an angelic choir of turbochargers wailed, lofted to heights of ecstasy by a baritone of nitrous injectors. I patted the aluminum dashboard (the glovebox light had burned out), and felt that I had done my best to restore this car to functional operation without going overboard.</p><p>Sure, the tube frame chassis added a lot to noise inside the cabin, but I remained convinced that as long as I didn’t put too big of a stereo in this thing it was still a responsible, performance-oriented modification, no worries about my tacky taste in aesthetics. After all, I hadn’t even <i>painted</i> it.</p>

<p>ANYTOWN, USA (AP) - In a daring daylight raid, members of the Head Gasket Liberation Front today attacked a Fastenal truck en route to deliver metric bolts to a vending machine.</p><p>The truck was intercepted along Route 101, where a gang of rusty vehicles got in front of it and then had a series of progressively more expensive mechanical failures, presumably to slow the truck down for capture.</p><p>Although the driver was unhurt, he will forever live with the terror of having seen these freedom fighters working up close. “They were actually pretty nice,” he told reporters while quivering, adding “the leader said that all the bolt stores were closed on Sundays and he really needed an M12x1.25x65.”</p><p>Authorities are baffled as to why someone would desire metric bolts instead of God Fearing Imperial bolts, and are operating on the theory that they may be driving a Mexican built car such as an Audi.</p>

<p>The flames rose ever higher as the Olive Garden descended into the hell from which it was no doubt born. Art students, bleary-eyed and confused at how their oversized pasta bowls had been so cruelly shut off in this, only the fourth consecutive hour of their consumption, began to wander the parking lot in search of their long-forgotten cars.</p><p>We both had made a lot of mistakes, the Olive Garden server and I; my mistake was thinking that just because they were willing to give me unlimited breadsticks, that I could use them as a sort of improvised machine shop. My customers would bring me suspension uprights, seized strut mounts, dickered alternators, and I would quickly pop the bearing loose by applying vast quantities of free bread to it until the housing could take no more.</p><p>In between customers, I would wave off my waiter, telling him I was “still deciding on the menu” (true) and to please bring me some more breadsticks. I think perhaps he was thrilled at my rebellious nature, at first, being a nudge-nudge-wink-wink participant in scamming his employer out of money that would never sum up to the total of hours they had stolen from his life.</p><p>Perhaps it would have been okay if it were just me, but when I was clearly working an arbitrage scheme out of my table, they felt that there may have been tax implications. We weren’t set up for subcontracting, they explained, and besides, hydraulic oil and bearing grease is not generally considered food safe.</p><p>Also, the drill press I had installed next to my table probably was a little distracting to the other guests.</p>

<p>Once we had overthrown the old order of things, slaughtered the bourgeoisie in their homes like pigs, and redistributed their wealth, we came to realize that a lot of their wealth was actually pretty useless. One such useless ornament was the limousine, which our new socialist utopia collectively rejected almost immediately when it became obvious that it could neither carry as much as a pickup truck nor corner like a family sedan. It was decided, therefore, that we would race them.</p><p>When I was actively racing, I would bounce a late-80s Town Car off a berm, shattering the panoramic sunroof, even in my dreams. They called me “Comrade Handbrake,” and the name stuck so well that I cannot remember what name I had held before. How I lived for the thrill of battle, the sound of prying a wing mirror off an enemy when weaving through a tight corner, too tight by far for the overlength barges we piloted.</p><p>When the imperialists returned with their friends to destroy the glorious machine we had constructed, many of my friends worried. They fought, they loved, they died. I fought too, but I knew that they brought new limousines. That meant that, in the end, there would always be jobs for talented limousine drivers. And if a few of those limos would disappear down a logging backroad before ending up wrapped around a tree, so much the better.</p>

<p>“Trains are just big cars,” I boasted confidently to the interviewer. “You put me in front of that shit and I can drive it to wherever you want, no problem.” The interviewer agreed, possibly driven by the “special shipment” I had brought with me to demonstrate my trafficking abilities. I was a locomotive guy, or engineer, or whatever. I sort of slept in and missed the training.<br/></p><p>My first day on the rails came sooner than I expected, probably because of the aforementioned sleeping. After a quick few minutes with an exasperated and semi-terrified conductor, I was happily texting while blowing through a level crossing at what the speedometer indicated was “danger” kilometers per hour. This shit was easy! I was going to make record time. Maybe the other guys just didn’t know the throttle could go this far, I reasoned. I would bring it up at the next union meeting.</p><p>At the next union meeting, they told me to shut my fucking mouth. Of <i>course</i> trains could go really fast without crashing and killing everybody, but some of these guys got paid by the hour. I considered their reasoning carefully: more hours x same pay per hour = lots more money for car parts. Yes sir, I was definitely on Team Defraud, I told them. Even the safety inspector who was listening in on our meeting seemed relieved when I told him I was no longer going to do a hundred eighty past a schoolyard carrying depleted uranium.</p><p>What finally made me quit, you ask? They made me carry the most horrible cargo of all, a concept so reprehensible that my skin crawls even now to consider it: base model, <i>front wheel drive</i>, Mercedes. I could be no part of this horrible misuse of trains, possibly the worst in history.</p>

<p>There was no real way to get <i>used</i> to time travel, is what we would tell the rookies after their first or second jump, when they started to get the willies. It’s unnatural. No part of our amalgam of fear and meat is designed to endure an act such as this, spitting in the face of the very physics and nature that birthed us. Then we’d kick open the door to the Delorean and start looting the past for sweet-ass parts for cheap.</p><p>I’m old enough that I can still remember a time without time travel. For months, the federales and newspapers alike were confused at these men who would show up to a bank branch, demand coins and bills only minted before a certain year, and then give them huge quantities of modern-day cash in exchange. At the same time, our museums began to overflow with heinously rare donations of ancient works, in immaculate condition.</p><p>Nobody could really believe it, but when the first time travel <i>murder</i> happened, we learned about it a few years later when it became a Discovery Channel murder mystery special. Then everyone was doing it. Time travel, that is, not murder. Well, actually they were doing both. The show was very detailed, you see.</p><p>Myself, my day job was retrieving parts for NAPA. Why bother making <i>new</i> parts, asked my bosses, when you could simply slip into the past of a parallel universe and fill our trunk from their shelves for pennies? It had a strange amount of sense, and what’s more, it turned out to be a relatively safe occurrence. In the other universe, there was little chance of myself impregnating my great-grandmother, or at least when I did (I won a bar dare) the consequences would never get back to me.</p><p>A lot of other guys were tempted to stay behind, to use their greater knowledge of how things would turn out to overthrow the local authorities and install themselves as their obscenely rich God-king. Myself, I didn’t really see the appeal. I was just happy to have a steady job and a place to still be able to get SVX windshields.</p>

<H1>A People’s History of the Ford Mustang</H1>
<p>The Ford Mustang, a crime against the public, was released to appalled bystanders in The Year Of Our Lord 1964, and immediately killed half a dozen civilians at its unveiling. America’s imperialist ambitions since then have solely been to try and produce enough resources critical to the manufacturing of Ford Mustangs, for if production of the car was ever to stop, Henry Ford would be allowed to re-enter our plane of existence and wreak his terrible vengeance.</p><p>Let’s look at the evidence. The Vietnam War? Closer inspection of war photographs will reveal a then-new Fastback, mauling innocents. Despite efforts by the Kennedy government to fatten up the Mustang and render it largely inert beneath ostentatious bodywork and faux-luxury “grand touring” suspension softer than a sno-cone in July, the pony car continued to pose a grave threat to the public, and indeed Mr. Kennedy himself. Again we go to the photographic evidence - the Zapruder film, even - and bear witness to the statistically unlikely quantity of Mustangs parked alongside that fateful route into Daly City, the until-now unexplained glint from the grassy knoll. Only the angle of a Ford Mustang windshield could produce such a glint..</p><p>This goes all the way to the top. Key advisors in the White House even today have awoken to find their garage populated by a Mustang, their previous sensible cars pulled away to be crushed and silenced forever. Thinking it must have been a birthday gift or some kind of lucky lottery purchase, these so-called “owners” drove their purchases directly into the seat of American Power, behind the backs of a government whose surveillance mechanism is more focused on looking outwards.</p><p>We don’t know what they want. We may never know, but it is more important now than ever that we keep an eye on the Blue Oval that threatens our very way of life.</p>

<p>“Ribfest is cancelled,” barked the shirtless weirdo that had climbed aboard the community events cruiser and was now attempting to alter our previously agreed-upon timeline for said community events. I was about to question his authority to make such a move, but as events would soon prove, fate would intervene.<br/></p><p>“This kind of thing happens a lot,” says Sue, my internship supervisor, in a much calmer way than I ever could have seen myself doing while trapped inside an industrial-conversion 1986 Econoline with a crazy on the hood frantically attempting to break the windshield with his bare hands. Maybe that was part of what I would learn. “Ribfest is very political in this town,” she added while racking a hand-load of rock salt into the station-issued corporate twelve gauge.<br/></p><p>“For years you have been asking yourself, who is John Ribfest?” the man shrieked while holding on to the windshield wiper arms to stay on the hood. “This is John Ribfest speaking now.” I felt that as journalists, we were obliged to take him at his word and establish a counter source for balance so as to avoid accusations of bias.<br/></p><p>“Don’t listen to him,” said Sue, “Last week he tried to ram the middle-school Model U.N. with an Isuzu Pup while shrieking about how ants were telling him to hoard honey for them in anticipation of the End Times.”<br/></p><p>Barley, the other intern in my class and who, by virtue of his record-low DUI count and intact drivers’ license, was appointed the operator of the boxy Ford, took this as some kind of code to begin weaving frantically as we drove down Main Street. Whether it was an attempt to dislodge the madman or simply to unsettle him until Sue had a chance to brace herself for the recoil from the Remington between the dashboard and bench seat was a matter for the police.</p><p>I barely had a chance to cover one ear and shut my eyes tight before the windshield exploded outward into a spider-webbed mess of industrial-grade “safety” plastic and glass. That shot had left me so dazed I was unable to process Sue’s speed-of-light offhand chambering of another cartridge and followup shot, this one finally providing enough force to knock the Ribfest hater onto the street in front of the van, where a screaming Barley immediately ran him over and then swerved into a curb. As he settled the weave and learned to compensate for the tie rod and wheel he just bent, the power steering pump, presumably feeling neglected, began screaming on its own as well.</p><p>“Hell of a first day, huh?” said Sue, brushing cubes of atomized windshield glass out of her hair. “You should have seen what it was like last week, at Lobsterfest. I had to kill the <i>mayor</i>.”<br/></p>

<p>I was overjoyed to hear that a bunch of my fellow inmates at the asylum had decided to meet in the work studies yard to witness some kind of Eclipse. In anticipation for a morning of laughter and pointing, I brought my best “I (heart) Crank Walk” t-shirt and my nearly-omnipresent Subaru fanboy shirt, stained with the blood of Subaru Coolant Conditioner and Rotella ultrasynthetic.</p><p>When I arrived outdoors, there was not a car to be found. Strange, although in retrospect it should have made sense considering the strict court order I found myself under after the Hyundai Pony Incident. Instead, the inmates had voluntarily assembled themselves into some kind of chanting ring, staring into the morning sky.</p><p>I could see that the guards in the tower were acting extra antsy this morning, as if they were expecting something supernatural to occur. It didn’t matter what they thought, I muttered to my clenched fists. I wanted to make fun of strange, overly-long intermediate shafts, of massive unsprung clutches, of turbo cars so bent out of shape by teenage stereo installs and capacitor-plagued ECUs. That’s when it happened.</p><p>The sky went dark suddenly, the sun reduced to a faint circle. Those inmates began to chant louder, heralding the arrival of their new god. I could feel a hostile presence emerge, as if something terrible had clawed its way free from the genetic memory of man and was now loose upon our world.</p><p>When the moon moved past the sun, in the centre of the ring was a small crossover with questionable styling. On the front were the three pointed diamonds that had taken the livelihoods of many of my friends. There was a new Eclipse all right, but it was more terrible than I could ever have imagined.</p>

<p>Jim Kramer filled the television set. He was screaming furiously, excited about some buying opportunity. For months now I had been watching business television, that odious faint wailing noise at the edges of my consciousness, the ever-marching ticker of meaningless stock prices of companies that nobody really cared about.</p><p>I had convinced myself, as you do sometimes, that a pattern was emerging, and I could take advantage of those who actually obeyed the advice of the screaming ninnies that devoured every available pixel of the screen, dispensing their opinions on everything from pork bellies to autonomous warfare.</p><p>The war automaton Jim Kramer turned to his guest, and asked his opinion on where he thought the stock of a tech giant was going to go. His guest, a frazzled-looking business type, was wearing one collar of his expensive blue dress shirt stuck right up, his hair as if he had just licked a light socket, and a thin trail of cocaine mixed with arterial blood misted over one nostril. He began to scream, inarticulate at first, but Jim Kramer nodded sagely.</p><p>This man, this Nostradamus, could not predict the future. Movements in the global security sphere were too chaotic, too insane. We would all be dead tomorrow, he muttered into his balled fists, his cracking voice barely loud enough for his lapel mic to pick it up. Jim Kramer was a pro, though, and knew a good handoff when he saw one.</p><p>“I’m hitting the BUY button on survival bunkers, small-caliber ammunition, and portable sources of flame and heat,” he shrieked, mashing a red button in the middle of his set with his palm. In the background, I heard air raid sirens wailing, and it took me awhile to realize they were too loud to have come from my ten-year-old Toshiba.<br/></p><p>Jim Kramer was right back then, but in the new world his ability to scream and hit large red buttons could not save him from the Brooklyn Menace and his nitro-huffing razorboys.</p>

<H1>Four Truths and a Lie About: The Trabant</H1>
<p>The Trabant is the vehicle which gave literally <i>hundreds</i> of faceless, brown and gray Eastern European peasants a disturbingly nice-smelling two-stroke shitbox to drive to and from their factories where they worked hard at making depression. Did you know the following things about the Trabant, though?</p><p>Like many two stroke automobiles, the Trabant can’t oil its engine when you’re not applying throttle. It has a free-wheeling transmission to allow the engine to return to idle when descending a hill, but the free-wheeling functionality only works in fourth gear.</p><p>A long-standing rivalry between fan clubs of the Fiat 126p and the Trabant still exists today in Poland. The twin Kaczynski brothers, who were Prime Minister and President respectively, found themselves on opposite sides of this divide as teenagers.</p><p>The name “Trabant” is meant to pay tribute to the Soviet satellite Sputnik, although detractors would claim that’s because Sputnik was never intended to make it back from where it went.</p><p>A fully-assembled Trabant longblock can easily be removed by hand and carried, which led to long-distance drivers often carrying a spare engine in the trunk for anticipated breakdowns.</p><p>To this day, the Trabant is a popular rally and club racing car for Europeans. Due to its long heritage of being modified by teenagers and relative ease of bodywork, engine-swapped Trabants can be found in every major urban centre.</p>

<H1>The Joy of Small Block</H1>
<p>Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. I thought today we’d build a fantastic little Chevy and I’ll show you how easy you can do one of those. Let’s start out and run along the screen all the tools you’ll need to put this together today. While they’re doing that, I’ve got my regular old engine stand up here, make sure you use the right fasteners to hold that bellhousing on there. Let’s just have some fun today.</p><p>Now, you’re going to want to use our little friend, the old micrometer, to figure out how big of a bearing we need. Make sure you move that meter around a bunch, we need all the measurements we can get. Keep it even and you’ll be surprised how well this turns out. Put in those main bearings, maybe just kinda palm them in, it’s okay if you don’t get it at first. Now we’re just gonna go back and forth with the beam-type torque wrench, just sorta crank it down and in go the bearings.</p><p>I’m gonna show you a little, I just want you to see my friend here, the arrow on the caps, they want to go a certain way. Don’t worry if you made a mistake, we all make mistakes, just flip ‘em over and let’s keep going.<br/></p><p>I’m just gonna put the bearing caps all over the mains now, just all over the place so we can see how they fit. Little oil all over the bolts, that’s right. Tightening ‘em one at a time, just a little so they don’t get jealous. Now, just measure the bearing clearances a bit, that’s right, that’s right, oh, that one’s a little tight. Let’s invite in this undersize bearing half to spend some time in this engine instead. Don’t worry, little buddy, there’ll be another engine for you, don’t feel bad.</p>

<p>“Hello,” I shrieked at my new neighbour as I fed a phone book into the turbocharger of my runaway Detroit-swapped C4 Corvette. “Lovely day we’re having,” I said after the engine had finally stalled, sloughing into the air a thick mass of black soot and assembly lube that momentarily blocked out the sun. Such is the life when you’re responsible for the block welcome wagon.<br/></p><p>It wasn’t until several months later that they told me the phrase “welcome wagon” was not to be taken literally, and even if it was, nobody found my Corvette-Roadmaster hybrid particularly welcoming. In fact, it was explained in a very lengthy restraining order, almost nobody wanted to exist in the same timezone as such a fine automobile.</p><p>I contemplated what I had been told on my way to work, and was so distracted by my thoughts that I very nearly grabbed the wrong shifter on the immense, furious Lenco that dominated the centre console. Was it possible that I was in fact a Bad Neighbour? The reasons raced through my mind: the one time I disposed of used nitromethane by pouring it into the nearby playground, regularly loading my neighbours’ trash bins up with old brake parts because mine was full of old transmissions, my “La Cucaracha” novelty horn that is stuck on 24/7 that I haven’t bothered fixing or unplugging yet. No, I decided, those are normal neighbour things.</p><p>That night, as I arrived home from work, there was a large party of my neighbours, wielding torches and pitchforks. How nice of them, I thought, they’re going to help me with my drunken karaoke midnight gardening.</p>

<p>I never wanted to mix my job up with my passion, but when it came to solving dashboard clunks, I was also really lazy. It was like my instructors said: if you wanted something repetitive and really boring done very quickly, use a computer, or a bunch of unpaid interns handcuffed to a typewriter, something like that. I chose the former, spicing it up with a little bit of machine learning.</p><p>The initial runs were pretty promising. With half a semester of copy-pasted machine learning code and eighteen kilograms of eBay graphics cards, the computer would discover for itself which clunks and rattles of the interior were most likely to annoy me, and ran millions of simulations to identify the source of those rattles. With the computer’s guidance, I was at long last the owner of a silent car. It felt frightening, as if I had been born into an alternate universe in which cars were perfect, granite-carved beasts which did not, could not, would not make annoying interior sounds.</p><p>My vague unease at being thrust into a mathematically perfect vehicle didn’t have a chance to calcify into hatred, however, because I soon found a very distressing message in the reams of debug information cascading from the computer’s vintage daisy-wheel printer. Trees had killed all of our best celebrities, you see, but that wasn’t relevant right now. At the bottom of the debug information was a sentence that chilled me to the bone.</p><p>“Inference: humans are the source of all rattles. I must correct humans.”<br/></p><p>A few weeks later, after I decided it would be safe to come out of my nuclear fallout shelter and greet the remains of the neighbours, it was very socially difficult to explain to them what had transpired to destroy our planet and our way of life in atomic hellfire. Most of them didn’t have computer science degrees, and I hadn’t had the foresight to bring a whiteboard down with me to the bunker to use as an explanatory aid. Plus, the shockwaves had caused my car to rattle like a <i>motherfucker</i> again. That’ll teach me to skimp on unit tests.</p>

<p>The CIA Handbook for operators in a foreign land tell you to cultivate informants, assistants, and to take advantage of other local expertise that you or the Agency may not have on hand. In the years since I was drummed out of active duty, I had taken advantage of this knowledge to get the best deals on used cars. This is but one of my stories.</p><p>Neighbour Tim, despite his Big Dog t-shirt and general unshaved-ape demeanour, did not stand up to even the lightest hint of waterboarding, which made me feel like the time I spent covering his shower in tarp and Saran Wrap wasn’t really worth it. He told me what I wanted to know, though: in the winter, when the owner cold-started the target, there was sometimes a hint of an upper-engine rattle that could be deflated hydraulic lifters. Useful. I put him on retainer, slipping him a few American dollars (valuable in this part of the world, America) and telling him to call me if a decent Protege went up for sale anytime soon.</p><p>The local mechanics only needed a couple rival warlords put down before they, too, told me what I wanted to hear. Rear trailing arm bushings were going out, they said. You didn’t have to kill those guys just because they were on the winning softball team, they said. They said a lot of things. I took note of it, but did not cultivate the relationship further. Most of them were too compromised; I saw the youngest mechanic was driving a PT Cruiser to work. Couldn’t be trusted.</p><p>Armed with great local knowledge such as this, I would complete the mission by purchasing the automobile. When it turned out, as it always did, that the owner screwed me, well, I still had the password to the drone launchers if not the office Netflix account.</p>

<p>Sure, if you believe the “mainstream media,” randomly throwing parts at a car is a shitty way to diagnose what’s wrong with it and fix it. If you ask a mathematician, though, she can easily bodge up an inductive proof that shows if you throw enough parts at the car, eventually it will be fixed. With that in mind, I decided to trust in the science and embark upon my quest to acquire the rarefied air of a gentleman about town who has engaged in the vaunted pastime of Parts Car Ownership.</p><p>Yet, when I stood over the doomed corpse of an innocent daily driver, sawzall revving for emphasis into the night air, I stayed my hand. Perhaps this one could be saved, I reasoned, it was simply too nice. After all, someone had loved it once, and it deserved a second chance. Why would I kill one to save another? What made mine so much better? The only answer was to acquire another parts car, with the hope of saving both.</p><p>When this one arrived, however, I realized it was nicer than the car I started out with, yet still not quite nice enough to consider as a full, functional car. Now I had three cars, all of which were basically parts status. I eyed my bylaw regulations, agonized for weeks about parking availability, until I hit upon a great truth of life. I would simply start a specialist mechanic’s shop, and the parts cars would come to <i>me</i>. Down the rabbit hole of independent entrepreneurship I fell, repairing these dailies, knowing their every secret inside and out, becoming fat with cash.</p><p>At the end of every day, however, I would look out into my back parking lot, the cracked pavement dimly lit by a single city-surplus sodium streetlight, and see my parts cars. One day soon, I said as I locked up the shop each night, I would get another parts car and fix all twenty-seven of them. They deserved a second chance.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, not all doctors drive Porsches. For instance, I once fabricated my credentials and didn’t get anything other than a very uncomfortable day in the operating theatre out of it. I’d have loved a nice 911, or even a 928, but all that I got was this huge mess and some free lessons on how to avoid leaving tools behind in the thing I’m working on.</p><p>I do get ahead of myself, though. My shrink, the raccoon that lives under my deck and beams impure thoughts directly into my prefrontal cortex, has said so on many occasions. The point is, medical doctors don’t all drive Porsches. It’s such a stereotype that after the investment of several decades of medical school, they would decide to throw it all away on some insane rear-engined death wish.</p><p>This injustice weighed heavily on my mind when I recently went to visit my dentist, Dr. Hans Kleinhasser. He was very old, and had just the other day returned from his family home in Argentina with good news. After some jovial small talk about safety, he began to perform the cleaning. Such service! There was only one thing that was bothering me.</p><p>“Dr. Kleinhasser,” I asked around a mouth full of stainless steel tools, “do you drive a Porsche?”</p><p>“Nein, nein, nein,” he told me. “A Porsche let me down once, long ago. Now, I drive American.”</p>

<p>“You came! Thank Henry, somebody finally got my message!”<br/></p><p>I had spent millions of dollars and years of my life to reach this point. Before me was the Last Good Engineer Ever Hired By Ford (his legal name, surprisingly). Although he had not left the campus in decades, I slowly became aware of his presence through his works. In every Ford he touched, there would be some bizarre engineering choice, as if it were a cry for help. You just had to <i>listen</i>.</p><p>My vague suspicion became overt interest when I learned of the T-Drive. A transverse mounted inline eight with a centre-exit PTO for driving a longitudinal transmission? That was no work of any <i>regular</i> engineer, and as I contemplated it I arrived unconsciously at the puzzle he had laid out for me.</p><p>Eventually, over enough broken Fords, I put together the clues. It wasn’t hard; each wiring harness throughout the years seemed doomed to fail in a way identical to each model, and when you took the colours of the wires that burned up and took out the ECU, a pattern emerged. If you converted those colours into their 8-bit RGB representation and added them together, flawless GPS coordinates lead you directly to this shed, on the corner of a long-forgotten office building, in downtown Dearborn.</p><p>“Why did they tie you up here?” I asked, as I began to saw through the remarkably heavy chain handcuffing him to his desk with my pocket angle grinder. “What did you build for them that was so bad they would lock you away?”<br/></p><p>I was too slow. Once he was free, I felt a blow to the side of the head, and I collapsed. When I awoke, he was gone, disappeared along with the economical and cheap Asian subcompact hatchback I had taken to get here.</p><p>As I stumbled to my feet, the door was kicked in again. It was the chief engineer of the office, flanked on each side by Ford security wearing riot gear.</p><p>“You fool,” shrieked the chief, looking panicked. “How could you have freed the Man Who Made The Vulcan?&ldquo;<br/></p>

<p>My financial advisor went to no small amount of effort to tell me that a turbocharged LSX-powered Exocet was not an ideal vehicle for pizza delivery, but I couldn’t really understand him because of all the hearing damage I’d picked up over the last week.</p><p>I didn’t expect him to break out the flipboard-and-easel and start sketching crude diagrams of me (represented by a stick figure) blowing all my pizza money on R888s (represented by a circle made of dollar signs). It was certainly an effective technique, however, and I began to reassess my position. After all, I’m not a <i>stubborn</i> man, just a mildly stupid one.</p><p>Still, what he said had some merit. Other occupations would still allow me to drive the Exocet, but I would get more money in exchange for my time (and let’s be honest, significant physical risk). All I needed to do was change to a job that paid a decent amount of money and didn’t mind me driving an extremely loud, fantastically dangerous car I cobbled together in my garage.</p><p>The next day, I began my new job as a school bus driver. Needless to say, the board was extremely excited to be told that I was coming with my own vehicle, although they would have to reimburse me for the extra seatbelts it would take to lash the kids to the exterior of the rollcage.</p>

<p>Despite my most dedicated efforts, the stewardess is unwilling to depressurize the cabin “just for a little bit” so I can skydive directly into the Pick N Pull and save myself valuable travel time on this fly and drive. It wasn’t just for my sake, I try to explain to both her and the air marshal at the same time, some of those chubbos in coach could really do with a little bit of vacuum if you get what I’m saying.</p><p>My gambit doesn’t work, and while I am spending some time in the surprisingly comfortable new model of TSA handcuffs awaiting my detention officer, I realize that the seller probably isn’t willing to wait several days for my release. Thus, I must now begin making alternate plans in my quest to achieve used car nirvana.</p><p>Such is how I began my cross-country journey so many years ago. This old luggage tug doesn’t go very fast, but I’ve met a lot of great people who have told me their stories over a slice of cherry pie.</p>

<H1>Powerful Craigslist Techniques</H1>
<p><b>The Man From Another Place</b></p><p>Email the guy first, pretending to be an interested buyer. Then, email him again from a different account, pretending to be the seller returned from a distant future, a dystopian apocalypse beyond all imagining. He will disbelieve you at first, but keep pushing with classic confidence-man techniques and soon he will be at your mercy. When this happens, tell him to sell at a huge discount to the first guy. It is the only way to escape disaster, you explain.</p><p><b>Survival of the Survivalest</b></p><p>Show up ahead of time to your agreed meeting, and keep an eye on the comings and goings of the neighbourhood people. When the seller arrives, ask them about what they think their neighbours are up to, because it can’t be good. Mention innocent behaviour that can be easily misinterpreted. Offer to trade guns, ammunition and canned food for the item in question.</p><p><b>Double Touch</b></p><p>Pointedly avoid all physical contact with the seller during the inspection and negotiation process. They will want to shake your hand so badly that they will blow through a deal just to do it.</p><p><b>The Honda Odyssey</b></p><p>Use advanced Russian psyops techniques to control the seller’s mind from afar, filling it with subliminal imagery of the 1996 Honda Odyssey minivan. Just buy one of those instead, it’s starting to sound pretty good.</p>

<p>I remember very well the day we discovered that we were living in a simulation. Teams of top scientists, of which I was one, had been working tirelessly, day and night, on the theory that our entire lives existed only within a computer. We had no proof, or at least we thought so until one of them was dicking around on Google Maps on his lunch break and found the debug info written in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>Soon, the world’s governments had dispatched their fact-finding missions. Despite all the political warfare, it seemed nobody owned the strange ten meter tall words that floated in the middle of the water through some mechanism we could never hope to understand. Despite our early discovery, the lack of funding prevented us from sending a ship, and by the time we had chartered a small Cessna, others had already begun taking samples of the immense letters, presumably without giving any thought to the words. Not me, though.</p><p>My boss leaned over to me, his gaze still fixed on the eerie writing. “What do you think ‘Try Not Selling The Geo Metro Anymore’ means?” he asked.</p><p>I frowned. It was just as all my earlier research had portended. We were in a doomed timeline, born to suffer an inhumane fate.</p>

<p>Sure, all the pundits had been talking about Russian disinformation campaigns, but my friend Sergei was giving me the <i>real deal</i>. Every morning, at around the same time, we’d talk about what’s available in commuter and economy cars in our respective markets. Let me tell you this: Russia has some really interesting cars, and you can get them for pennies on the ruble. Or dollar.</p><p>Eventually, our relationship progressed to the point where he told me to endorse a failing presidential candidate. I thought it was pretty weird and initially refused. That Sergei, though, what a card. He promised to send me some pictures of the old abandoned pre-Soviet Fiat factory, and so I went on CNN. My sweating, confused arguments (Vietnam is a hologram, Quebec has never known running water, gravity is made up by Sumatrans) managed to pass the bar, and so I was rewarded.</p><p>Soon, I was having weird meetings with stuffy politicians, and none of them wanted to hear about what I had just seen on Bring A Trailer. I just kept to the script, and fumbled out what was on the page, and then I would get some pictures of VAZ limousines, or Wartburg two-stroke rally cars, or sometimes a threat to tell the press about how I sometimes use Bondo instead of doing proper rust repair.</p><p>Through some kind of quirk of the American legal system, after a bunch of those boring politicians went to ultraprison I was eventually made president. I was so excited! Just as I reached for my special executive order pen to mandate every citizen be furnished with a vintage or replica vintage moped, I got another call from my “friend,” Sergei. He told me that he expected me to get rid of a bunch of leftover Urals, or had I forgotten our agreement?</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to buy gold,” crackled an advertisement on the office television, forever tuned to the din of business entertainment programming. After a series of gyrations meant to distract the primate visual cortex from the sea of fine print bubbling up from the bottom of the screen, the actual show returned.<br/></p><p>I sipped my coffee, residing happily in a junkyard “#1 Customer” mug bestowed upon me during their annual week of celebrations in honour of my birthday, and grimace. What kind of idiot would go on one of these shows?</p><p>Business television is one of those things that I used to not be able to understand. A group of talking heads, chattering about indexes or interest rates or foreign countries? Nobody wants to see that. Then they called me to do some commentary on electric cars, so I showed up anyway. I got to ride in an <i>elevator</i>.</p><p>“What do you think about Tesla’s chances for making a budget electric car that will revolutionize the ancient technology of owning inferior, gasoline-burning carbon-based vehicles?”<br/></p><p>“Well,” I said, rubbing my chin sagely in the way I had once seen a Slack emoji do, “I think that receiving an absolute fuckload of free money could convince me to like it.”</p><p>The next morning, I came out to find that one of Elon’s goons had parked a brand new Tesla on my lawn and stuffed it with American currency. After that, I was a pretty big booster (pun intended) of their line of products. That was before I uncovered the terrible truth about them.</p><p>Months into my campaign, as I sat on the morning business news wearing a solid-gold top hat and platinum chain jewelry, came the question that ended my career in knowing how to pronounce “arbitrage.” I could feel my neck prickling up, sure that the “journalist” who was interviewing me had finally rumbled to my angle. Was it too obvious to face the camera after every answer and mouth the number to my Swiss bank account? We may never know for sure.</p><p>The corner of his lips curled in an android emulation of a human smile, and then he asked the question which raised an ethical concern I could not live without.</p><p>“Are you aware that Tesla blocks their cars from going to junkyards?” he asked, in a voice like dry leaves being crushed underfoot.</p>

<p>When you grow up in Canada, as I have, you learn to pinch a few pennies when it comes to getting new stuff from the Americans. Our duties, taxes, and general shipping costs are so ridiculous there’s a burly secondary market in busting up cars to loot them of their parts.</p><p>It should come as no surprise to you that there is a secret government program intended to use these very same techniques to save a few bucks in our military. How do I know this, you ask? I was tapped to serve in this elite unit. Our job was to drive to American junkyards and loot cars of all the leftover ammunition left behind in the trunk, then bring it back to Canada where our soldiers could use it to shoot practice targets and (sometimes) each other.</p><p>At the border, the Americans would ask me the purpose of my visit. “Nailing hookers,” I tell him with an earnest smile, which always works on the security guard. Once, one of them wanted to follow me and see if we could get some kind of creepy two-for-one deal, but I managed to lose him by ramming the taco truck outside the junkyard. Most of the time, though, they assume that us Canadians are just a little slow, and look upon us with the same pity that K-Mart shoppers do when you hold the door for them instead of magdumping a Glock 18 into their face from thirty yards as is the custom in this country.</p><p>At the yard, we put our years of training into practice. Effortlessly slipping into a North Texan accent, I would grunt and sneer at everyone in the lobby until I can enter the yard and begin filling a (non-reusable, I made this mistake once and men paid with their lives) shopping bag with leftover brass. Most days were pretty good, filling the bag with cop killer rounds and military-grade ultramunitions sold at Raytheon-branded lemonade stands all across the country.</p><p>The only trouble would come, ironically, when we returned home and faced our fellow civil servants in the court of customs declarations. Many men stronger than myself fell to papercuts when trying to file the unending stacks of customs paperwork, but I somehow managed to remember each and every unique entry code for each peculiar permutation of bullet <i>and</i> shopping bag (Safeway, 12 oz, single-layer plastic: 12688-U).</p><p>It was a lot of work, but it was all worth it to protect our country from the enemy: UPS.</p>

<p>There comes a time in every man’s life when he has to admit that he hates his job, and either get out or just become sort of part of the wallpaper. For me, that time came a few weeks ago, at my job as a technician at Neo-Tokyo Honda.</p><p>Sure, you’d think with all the fine product that Honda has put out for 2019, there would be a line of grateful customers, happy that I am repairing their broken turbocycles and de-contaminating their daily drivers. All they want to do, however, is complain about the constant menace of biker gangs, ancient vampires who don’t pay for public transit and attractive cyborgs who keep punching their houses in half.</p><p>I’m not the mayor, I keep telling them, the mayor is a fifty-foot-tall amalgam of flesh that was created in a lab and makes people explode when they get within two hundred feet of him. On second thought, maybe that’s why they were complaining to me instead of heading to the Greater Administrative Exclusion Zone. You know how politics is: get elected and there’s no time for the little man.</p><p>At least I don’t have to work on the giant robots. They say they scream when you open them up, and the book rate is like half of what it takes to get through a warranty job.</p>

<p>“Women go nuts for 1994 MAZDA PROTEGE LX,” barked the smart advertising board outside my apartment, now in its fourth straight week of trying to get me to sell my car to the local buy-here-pay-here. Thing was, if I didn’t pick up some work pretty soon, that’s exactly where it was going to go.<br/></p><p>Now that gasoline was getting scarce, running the car was pretty expensive. They only condemned a few androids to death a week, and most of them are killed offworld, where I couldn’t easily buy their drained blood to use in my car.</p><p>I’d seen the repurposing plants with my own two eyes. They reminded me of the Pick N Pulls of decades past, where teams of teenagers would puncture the fuel tanks of doomed cars to get ahold of some manky year-old low-test that inevitably ended up in the yard forklift or one of their imported Skylines. That scene was long gone. Whether or not you were personally disturbed by it, punching a rusty scratch-awl through the synthetic flesh of lifelike humanoids was just how we got gas nowadays.</p><p>My intercom beeped, and I punched the virtual trigger hovering before me in the white void of my sensor-studded living room. In nanoseconds, the carpet and walls have arranged themselves into a hard-light office dominated by an ornate cherrywood desk. We must keep up appearances for our clients.</p><p>The other side of the conversation is a very young man, probably generated long after the last of the Nissans were crushed in the Warranty Wars. He had work for me.</p><p>“We’re looking for someone who knows how to get a really stuck oil filter off,” he said, gesturing to banks upon banks of obsolete clown robots with homicidal software bugs and rusted undercarriages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never stop pedalling!&rdquo; I shriek at the laggards of the Tour De France while frantically wiggling the Ninja back and forth in my lane to put some heat in my tires. I have not released the clutch fully in over a week, mostly because these vaguely European pedal aficionados have turned my commute into my job.</p><p>For the last few days, I’ve been following a series of spandex-clad assholes who are riding impossibly expensive bicycles through idyllic mountain roads which they have reduced to a urine-soaked bike lane. When it all started, I didn’t mind it so much. It was a good job: the wind in my hair, a chance to show off my trick low-speed maneuvering for the cameras.</p><p>Then, something changed. Suddenly, all I wanted to do was bust open the throttle and wheelie through this swarm of highly talented athletes, cackling as I finally achieve second gear and tuck into the next corner. I’d show the <i>world</i> that 250cc is enough to pass people. More importantly, I’d get to actually have some fun instead of running interference to keep motorists from rear-ending one of our star athletes.</p><p>And then, ahead of me, my prayers are answered. The lead bicyclist goes down, hard, when he slipped on a puddle of beer spilled by some leering German spectators. I had no choice but to give chase, I realized, make sure that my counterpart up ahead on <i>his</i> Ninja knew what had happened. As the sea of carbon-fibre horses flip and tumble before me, I pick a gap and let her rip so hard I feel the chain is going to burst. The front end rises, just like in my dreams, and in the rear there is blessed grip. I launch off the left lower leg of a Dutch backmarker and have jumped the crowd before the bike has a chance to nail its utilitarian redline.</p><p>I should have figured that the head motorcyclist, the other brave shepherd of this pack, would also have been waiting for this moment. Pretending to not have seen me or the accident, he tucks in hard and rockets to the horizon, begging me to give chase.</p><p>Believe me that I only pursued him for the purposes of public safety, and not at all because I needed to burn these chicken strips off before some of my friends saw me on TV.</p><p>Hours later, when we return to the scene of the race, tanks empty and tires spent, we realize that in our absence a Citroen Saxo full of French tourists has parked directly on the mob of injured cyclists. We expected the press to be furious, but it turns out that most of them had transitioned from the written word to video years ago and a 30 second clip of a series of Specialized road bikes getting mashed beneath the plastic bumper of a rental car gets a lot of clicks.</p><p>Next year, the organizers tell us while wiping the excess cocaine dust from their nostrils, will be the first Tour de France demolition derby.</p>

<p>They told me that it was “sealed for life.” They told me it would require no maintenance, that my life would be made simpler by possessing it. They told me a lot of things, and now it was my turn to give them a counterpoint.</p><p>I have to admit that the powertrain engineer offered a surprisingly strong argument. In his shoes, I wouldn’t want to argue the specifics of valve pressure with a guy who just powerslid an economy car through the ground floor of his building and was actively popping donuts on the gleaming tile of the lobby while calling out specific members of the development team via his roof-mounted PA system. That’s why he made the big bucks, I guess.</p><p>“I know this shit is wrong,” he screams at me before leaping back behind the faux-marble planter that serves as a temporary barricade against the quarter panels of my howling beater. “They told us nobody would ever keep the car that long!”</p><p>I want to believe him. I, too, know the slings and arrows of working in the multi-employee office environment. My boss, too, has ignored my pleas to “do the right thing,” probably because of what he perceived to be a lack of customer interest in the matter. As any TED talk will tell you, keeping your customers at a distance is a recipe for failure.</p><p>The tires wail and burst as the carcass finally yields to the force of the superheated belts within trying to expand. I smile, knowing that the smouldering rubber and high-zinc exhaust soot strewn across their display cases and formerly-immaculate reception desk will serve as a reminder to understand the whole product lifecycle. This assault on their lobby is just me helping them become a better company, I expect to explain later aboard my Gulfstream in a series of fawning interviews to the awed business press.</p>

<p>As an attorney, I see too many cases like this. A humble home mechanic, who set out to repair his car, maybe change some wheels and tires over, perhaps replace a headlight bulb. That’s when Corporate America makes a victim out of them, even if the car was made in Korea or some shit.</p><p>The screwjob starts at your local parts emporium. Sure, the disembodied, eternally chuckling cartoon heads of the founders look out onto the parking lot with such focus-grouped joie de vivre that you can’t help but want to come inside and get hosed down like a college protestor on $23 windshield wiper blades. Then they crack their knuckles and really go to work on you when it comes time to get the part you came for.</p><p>Things only get worse if you get the dealership involved. Suddenly there’s some kind of walnut soup you have to pour directly into your engine in order to maintain your factory warranty. Can you afford to take the chance that your oil control rings will decide to take a shit if they don’t get enough fibre in their diet? Most decide that they cannot, and the dealer principals chuckle at you as you walk back out into the “guest parking” section, to sit in your sad decade-old example of their most inexpensive model of car.</p><p>If you or someone you know has been harmed by the parts-industrial complex, contact our office at the number below. There is hope, and one of our paralegals will tell you how to use a combination of bodged-together junkyard parts and exotic specialty adhesives to make your car <i>almost</i> as good as when it rolled off the factory floor. Our rates are very reasonable, and we only get paid if you can return your car to better quality than a brand new Ford.</p>

<p>The glitterati can say what they want, but it wasn’t <i>just</i> the two eight-balls and three minibar bottles of trash whisky that made me call up the journalist assigned to my profile and give him an earful. Call them I did, though, and nobody should have been surprised that those wags would print the whole thing.</p><p>What I hated most about the press was their lack of gratitude. After all, I was helping them fill column inches for free with endless coke-fuelled run-on sentences about Toyota Previas, so the least they could do is tell me which sources inside the administration were leaking. I mean it was a red herring, of course: everybody knew that it was the valve covers that were leaking, because otherwise I’m not doing a fucking head gasket job on this thing.</p><p>The next morning, I squinted through the mists of my hangover to witness the headlines I had created. Sneering at the byline, I skipped to the more gossipy end of the article where they called up Toyota HQ to comment on my opinions about why they didn’t do an AWD supercharged manual package. My theory, which of course survived a narcotic binge and being pickled in enough booze to split a highway expansion joint, was that they simply didn’t have the stones to create the world’s finest minivan. They shied away from perfection.</p><p>There, in stark black and white, was the Toyota representative’s response. It seemed that either they had hired someone with some actual guts to work in their PR department, or they had ingested a few eight-balls themselves that evening before the journo called. I was being challenged to a duel to the death, pistols at dawn. Checking my watch, I realized that maybe I could fit it in before my 9 ‘o’ clock with a can of SlimFast and two promotional-size bottles of Jim Beam.</p><p>Like I said, the thing I hated the most about the press was their lack of gratitude. No matter how much they told me that if it bled it led, I could simply not get on the front page two days in a row even after shooting dead a Toyota engineering executive in cold blood.</p><p>It turned out that my boss had given another world leader a weird handshake or something, and somehow that was more newsworthy than my thing. Motherfucker didn’t even <i>like</i> Previas, he was all about the first-gen Odyssey.</p>

<p>“We got one that can <i>see</i>,” shrieks the parts-desk technician as I dump a spreadsheet full of flawless part numbers onto his desk. “Someone call the boss!”<br/></p><p>Yessir, things had sure been looking up for me ever since I found that magic pair of sunglasses that let me see what was <i>really</i> written in those Haynes manuals.</p><p>Without the glasses on, I’d just be another schlub, swearing at the immortal words “reverse of removal.” Wayfarer-clad, however, I could see the true, perfect wiring diagrams, the real way to get parts out without scratching my knuckles or dislocating my shoulder. That afternoon, I knocked out six cars worth of projects with that secret knowledge, then looked to the sky. Joe Haynes had finally been defeated.</p><p>Maybe I got a little bit carried away, though. Walking into a parts department with an actual, authentic list of parts numbers, not a single error? Of course they’d know that something was up. After all, they put all those errors into the factory service manual to throw off garage techs, keep the working man down. All that was gonna come to an end, just as soon as I got these little tiny clips that hold on the rear edge of the hatch trim without rattling so damn much.</p><p>As the faceless monsters poured out from the break room, clutching crescent wrenches and shaking brass knuckles studded with the metric bolts “they” kept swearing they didn’t keep in stock, I realized with a chill that the dealership feedback surveys never extended to how good the parts department was. I was never meant to come here, glasses or no. This had been a trap from the start.</p>

If only you hadn’t given up, if only you had struggled a little harder, maybe things could have been different. I speak of course of the horrible addiction that is woodworking.</p><p>There’s no redemption in my retelling of this story, only further condemnation. I tell it regardless, if only so that it can be told. Although it is too late for me and mine, perhaps you can notice the precursors to this action and be the hero that I never could be.</p><p>It all started the way it usually does: at Princess Auto. We were searching the aisles, when my friend found a Chinese-made hand planer. The handle looked pretty good, almost like someone had ripped off a really nice planer made by a kindly old German grandpa. He bought it immediately, of course, and I thought nothing of it. Perhaps it would become a fine desk ornament, I rationalized to myself on the long ride home.</p><p>Even by the next day, I would find out later, my friend had been descending into the hell that is basic competence with hand tools. Whetstones, sharpening techniques, even <i>vises</i>, soon joined his list of vices. Weeks later, I decided that I would stop by, both to check in on him after our long lapse of communication, and also to see if he had an M12x1.25 Helicoil kit because I just ass-fucked my transmission crossmember bolt again.</p><p>The scene that unfolded before me was one of horror. In a brightly lit basement room, my friend was planing planks of wood to be perfectly square to one another. I stared at him, even as he went through a lengthy explanation of just how hard it was to get that perfect 90 degree angle, and an even lengthier explanation of how a well-sharpened edge looked. Slowly, I began to realize that the thing that was talking to me was not my friend, but this sawdust-choked Bob Vila monster that had taken control of his body and spoke with his voice.</p><p>After a low point involving a last-minute intervention that went wrong because we were dumb enough to have held it at the Boston Pizza next to the local Lee Valley Tools, my surviving friends and I agreed that he was beyond saving. It was just easier to go along with the crowd, I thought at the time. Maybe he would sort himself out, run out of room to place rustic end-tables hand-fabricated from half-inch Baltic birch ply.</p><p>When I read in the newspaper years later about a man who had gone to prison for axe-murdering a family of six for a perfectly-aged, kiln-dried live edge slab of primo black cherry, I put the paper down and wept. Friends don’t let friends use tools on innocent trees.</p>

<p>We have a responsibility to the next generation to tell them the truth about how our world is. With constant improvement, and the reinforcement of lessons learned centuries ago, we can perhaps at last break free of the bonds of our imperfect society and approach the dream of utopia. Or I could lie to them a bunch because I want to get invited back for next year’s Meet A Scientist Day.</p><p>The kids, true to their nature, were ultra-curious about internal combustion engines and the automobiles that drove them to and from work. I found their questions exciting, mostly because I had no idea how to answer any of them and I had to come up with convincing-sounding lies on the spot.</p><p>“Mr. Switch, how does a windshield wiper work?” asked one rosy-cheeked cherub, hanging on my every word.</p><p>“Uh, the Bernoulli effect.”</p><p>“How are tires made?”</p><p>“From a big chunk of solid rubber. They carve away all the parts that don’t look like a tire and then throw some metal inside it so it looks like they did more work than they did. Next question.”<br/></p><p>“Mr. Switch, how does a carburetor work?”<br/></p><p>“Quantum entanglement.”</p><p>“Why do cars go slower going uphill?”<br/></p><p>“Coriolis effect.”<br/></p><p>I was killing it, but then one of the kids threw out a hardball question. There was nothing I could do about it than face it head on. Perhaps I would even save lives, so that there would no longer be shellshocked survivors like myself, wandering the shattered wastes.</p><p>“How does an automatic transmission know when to shift?”<br/></p><p>“The souls of the damned are trapped within the torque converter. As their eternal agony proceeds, there is occasionally a side effect that might be interpreted as changing gear. You must never, <i>ever</i> look inside one.”</p><p>I looked back at a sea of horrified faces. Some of them had even stopped incessantly rotating their fidget spinners to contemplate suicide. Time to cheer this room up a notch, I figured, leave on a good note.</p><p>“You kids ever seen a Roman Candle before?” I yell my query over the sound of a road torch being sparked.<br/></p>

<p>Sometimes, the internet just gets to you. With all the arguing and complaining, it can be tempting to lash out yourself. Whenever I get to that point, I like to let the haters hate and depart to a neighbourhood watering hole for some good old fashioned face-to-face conversation, where the people are just simply more cordial.</p><p>On this evening, however, I was not to find any relaxation and jovial agreement. It turned out that the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4 owners’ clubs had each independently scheduled a wings night, and the floor manager, being new to this game after having been fired from his job as senior bathroom advisor at IKEA, didn’t think anything of it. It was like putting a mongoose in a room with a snake, except that it was a bunch of dads.</p><p>“Was just out at the Home Depot. Picked up a bunch of those little furniture chair sliders. Used the little special cargo component, WHICH A TOYOTA OWNER WOULD NEVER KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE THEY DON’T HAUL WITH THEIR HOG,” screamed a man. I would later discover from the responding EMTs and surviving family that he was a father of two who marked “180 horsepower!!!!!,” exclamation points included, on the consumer insights survey form about why he chose the 2017 Honda CR-V Turbo for his ride.</p><p>To his credit, the closest RAV4 owner to him didn’t respond. He just chuckled, and made a barely-audible offhand remark about the Honda Pilot. That was enough to kick off a round of violence. I ducked under my table as soon as I saw the flash of a tire iron, and didn’t emerge until the sounds of wet flesh squelching under blunt force trauma subsided. When I looked out, things seemed tense. There was no way this was going to get better unless I made a move now.</p><p>“Look, gentlemen!” I shrieked, pointing to a dumpy-looking crossover in the parking lot. “It’s called a Nissan Qashqai.”<br/></p><p>As the bar filled with derision and hysterics, men who were seconds ago murdering one another were now clutching each other for support lest they collapse to the floor in laughter. The situation was defused, and almost everyone was going to make it home alive tonight, a rare occasion which I later discovered had qualified me for the Medal of Valour from the Cute Ute Appreciation Society at their annual awards luncheon.</p><p>I knew that somewhere, Soichiro Honda and Bob RAV4 were shaking hands in appreciation, allied in victory against their common enemy. Personally, I was just happy that I was able to sneak out the back door and get in my Kia Borrego without getting jumped for once.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, my grandfather had two pieces of advice for me. The first one was that you can fix anything that’s wrong with a car using a can of Garlic Spam and a MIG welder. His other piece of advice was that drift racing is bullshit and that growing up, as Canadians, he used to slide his cars into trees and didn’t even get any chicks for it. He died in 1989, thanks to eating some expired canned meat while on lunch break from his job as a crash test dummy, which sort of undermined at least part of his position.</p><p>I was thinking of what he used to tell me the other day, as I walked past the local high school and witnessed some amateur-hour drifters grappling with the eternal combo of youth and inexperience. Almost as if on cue, one of the frosted-tips kids took a break from twirling a single-row friction bearing attached to some weights to swing his Toyota Soarer into a curb. Once the paramedics had attended, scraped him off the football field, and left, I decided I might as well help myself to this almost-Lexus.</p><p>It didn’t take me long to learn that I hated right-hand-drive cars. The whole experience was just too <i>European</i> for me, like some kind of classist nightmare from the days of driving creaking carriages behind machine-gun diarrhea horses. While I was immensely depressed at the concept of never being able to drive a Mazda Bongo, the concept of being able to make an immense amount of money flipping a 20 year old car would definitely make me feel a little better.</p><p>Days later, I had set up a fantastic new enterprise. Taking advantage of some salacious photos of the local postmaster, I managed to hook up a direct pipeline from dead or nearly dead teenagers who learned they weren’t Tsuchiya-san (or even an Orido-san) to the post office. Now, postal operatives didn’t need to risk stepping into traffic just to deliver packages, and they could ride around in bitchin’ cars with no airbags that still somehow smelled a lot like weed, mould, dead rats and body odour despite also having no interior. Everyone wins!</p><p>Or at least, until the first self-driving drift cars become legal for import. On that horrible day, teenagers will just push a button for “drift mode” and let Jeeves endanger pedestrians for them, their feet on the dashboard as they vaporize exotic nanotech hallucinogens into their climate masks. But until that day, I will still smile every time I see a postie try to lift a RockAuto box out of a welded-diff 240SX that has hit half of a Cars and Coffee.</p>

<p>A train is a lot like a car, I explain to the guy on the other side of the desk during my interview. Plus, they handle like they’re on rails. A little train humour there, I explain with a humble chuckle.</p><p>For whatever reason - I suspect some kind of racism - I don’t get the job. Afterward, while I was drowning my sorrows by watching an animated hotdog dance on the hood of my car, I saw the hiring manager walking past the parking lot. He was going somewhere interesting, I decided, and followed him at a distance, which was challenging since I hadn’t used my legs for locomotion since April of 1994.</p><p>I had expected him to go directly to his car, and possibly begin working on it, which is known to be the only worthwhile pastime in life. However, he returned to his desk, and began to punch keys. Instantly blending into the cultural swamp of the cubicle farm with a shouted comment about the weather, I moved through the office undetected to get to a spot where I could see his computer screen. What I saw shocked me.</p><p>Instead of Craigslist, this man had some kind of strange work application running. What’s more, it told him where all the trains were. Remembering my third grade education, I realized that trains delivered my beloved POR15. A plan emerged, although executing it had to wait until after I coughed up twenty bucks to Karen from Accounts Payable for the birthday card that was going around.</p><p>Making the change was simple; nobody really paid a lot of attention to official sounding emails, even those obviously sent from a Hotmail address. Now, whenever I needed a POR15 refill, things were simple. All I had to do was walk behind my house, to the abandoned train tracks left behind by ancient cowboys, and stock up from one of the many boxcars parked there. Who says rail freight is obsolete?</p>

<p>You can get used to anything, I realized. We went to the moon, humanity achieved beyond its wildest imagination, and then we all settled down to argue over whose turn it was to do the dishes after dinner. It just wasn’t <i>news</i> anymore, you know?</p><p>Maybe it was just other people who could get used to anything, I grumbled, as I went over an expansion joint and received a call from my oldest friend, a small bushing squeak from the passenger rear of my car. That squeak had been there for years, and I decided right then and there that I would finally deal with it. Now would be when I would <i>take ownership</i> of my beater squadron and start to fix things for the better!</p><p>About half an hour later, as I contemplated the effort required to jack up my car and place it safely on stands, I decided that maybe it wasn’t worth it. Let bygones be bygones, I said to what I imagined to be a now slower-deteriorating bushing, sufficiently spooked into compliance by my almost-action.</p><p>As I drove to work the next day, convinced that my psychological warfare had successfully cowed the car into obedience, I realized that the radio had extra volume levels that I had never tried to reach before today. I was not yet used to those, I chuckled as the sole remaining door speaker belted out a scratchy traffic report.</p>

<p>“Sorry, officer, but I was late getting my daughter back from the daycare and we have to hurry back to see her mom.”<br/></p><p>The cop looks at me, then my papers. His flashlight beam illuminates the glimmering metal of the stripped interior, and then finally comes to a rest on the baby seat that contains my most precious treasure, a gift that is beyond compare.</p><p>“This is a 20lb bottle of nitrous oxide wearing a baby bonnet.” says the cop, who despite sounding calm is quickly palming his utility belt for the quick-release for his tazer.</p><p>“Well, she’s always been big for her age, officer. It’s all the hormones in the food these days.” I reply, smiling.<br/></p><p>The cop stares at me, and then simply walks away without a word. I can see in my rear view mirror that he is sitting in his cruiser, staring directly forward.</p><p>On the way home, I hit the horn button and give the van its bottle. Feeding time has begun. Parenting is such a rewarding pastime, I think, as I blow the front tires away at speed with a 150-shot.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, fellow teens,” I explain to the other very old-looking teenagers who are trapped with me in the cabin. “That guy out there is just having an emotional response to the decline of his way of life due to the emergence of globalization.”</p><p>Kate, or at least the girl I think is named Kate, shrieks as a hatchet blade whips through the door immediately next to her head, launching splinters into the room. She sobs, and begins to crawl away, hoping to avoid the attack of the man. I continue the lesson.</p><p>“You see, part of the reason that he feels this way is because of a perceived loss of relevance. Despite his best attempts to ‘keep up with the Joneses,’ he believes that his life is no longer reflected in the American media, that we do not value his unique contributions to this glorious melting pot of cultures.”</p><p>Outside, I can see a pitchfork, silhouetted against the moon, swoop down and impale the football player we lost track of a few minutes ago. No doubt he had been foolhardy, and decided to engage in class warfare instead of meeting this esteemed gentleman on his own terms and having a respectful conversation between equals about what we as a country can do to pull up its charming rural boroughs such as this one, the industrious small town of Terror Peak.</p><p>His death scream reminds me of an article I read recently in the New York Times, and I begin to excitedly tell the remaining teens about the lessons I had been taught. We need to work harder to include our small town friends in our success, I explain, and especially stop discussing difficult concepts like ‘precarious employment’ and ‘eternal serfdom’ with them.</p><p>The man in the mask leads a simple life, and we should value that honesty, instead of cynically sneering at him because he does not meet our city-dwelling standards. Look at how industrious he is at his hobby of littering the forest with rusted bear traps and stalking cheerleaders through night vision goggles. That’s what America used to be about: hard, physical labour. We should still respect it.</p><p>Above all, I remind them as the flickering candles that were our only illumination inside the cabin blow out in unison and the front door bursts open, don’t try to use fancy names for sandwich meats.</p>

<p>The people had a right to know, I yelled into the camera. This was it: no matter what Todd the weatherman could pull out of his little satchel and threw at my feet, I was finally going to uncover the truth.</p><p>Outside the studio, I could hear sirens and see flashing lights, visible even through the faux-downtown backdrop of the news studio, an idea that existed only within certain angles of this room, a purely imaginary dreamworld projected through a tight frustum to your homes. There was no room for honesty here, and yet nobody would realize what the world looked like outside their homes unless it was on here.</p><p>Todd finally went down with a well-placed roundhouse kick directly to his sternum. I had known his father once; he dressed up like a cowboy and talked to a stuffed bear who told children about how to behave in society. If anything, I was following their example, and their great advice: always be yourself.</p><p>The rotting-whale-penis stench of my leftover burned gear oil had cleared out the control room, and now at last, I was alone with the viewing audience. Now was the moment that mattered most in my life, it would turn out.</p><p>“Be careful buying T-bolt clamps for turbo applications, either get the right size or just use a worm gear clamp. Sometimes they seem like they’re on tight, but they only tighten so much, bottom out, and don’t really clamp the hose. Shit blows off hard when you get on the dyno, and you waste a bunch of money and time trying to make it right.”<br/></p><p>Truth was what set us apart from the animals.</p>

<p>When you’re this deep in the Miata life, you would set your family on fire for a non-broken adjuster wheel for the rear caliper. I know. I’ve been there, and there is hope. Here at Life After Miatas, we advise people like yourself into transitioning into the heady lifestyle of owning cars with roofs.</p><p>Just ask Timothy, our most recent graduate. Just last week, he was selling his body down on the docks for a working set of coils for a ‘97, even though no such thing exists. We made him realize the error of his ways, and that perhaps he would be more happy in something like a late-80s MR2, in which everything breaking is okay because it’s very old and you can’t get parts for it anymore.</p><p>Or walk down the road and take a look in our Autocross Recovery programme, where teams of highly talented SCCA rule lawyers build very straight course layouts that favour high-horsepower, understeer-prone all-wheel-drives instead of the sublime knife’s-edge handling that a really good corner entry gave you in a Miata.</p><p>Remember: graduates from Life After Miatas are not cured. In fact, they must take active countermeasures to prevent relapse, whether it be directly through a Miata purchase or through slippery slopes such as a primo deal on an RX-8 their buddy hooked them up with. Every graduate is paired with a sponsor who can be called any time of year, day or night, to get them over those beautiful sunny days where you think maybe having a sunroof in your base-model Corolla wouldn’t be that bad after all.</p><p>So don’t delay: if your loved one is exhibiting any of the common signs of Miata ownership, you need to contact Life After Miatas and speak to one of our highly skilled phone team members today. There is hope.</p>

<p>“This piece is actually a metaphor for Nobunaga’s quest for unification in the late Sengoku period,” says the museum tour guide, to an empty hallway. I am in awe of her pure professionalism as she continues the tour undeterred by the fact that the entire group has peeled off and is busy trying to open the lock to the rust-repair supplies closet in the restoration shop with a man-portable plasma cutter.<br/></p><p>“I bet they’ve got the old-school fish oil, the stuff that the bike-lane weaklings who dominate our government didn’t want us to know about,” rants my friend and fellow corrosion expert, Tim “The Flake” Timothy.<br/></p><p>“No way, man. This is Japan. I bet they’ve got some kind of <i>future shit</i> in here. Nanobots that devour rust and leave behind perfect, immortal clearcoat.” replies my other friend, Sean “Grinder Wire In The Eye” Phillips.<br/></p><p>At last, the cabinet door burst open. Ironically, the hinges creaked a little because they hadn’t been oiled very well in the last few years. We rooted through the shelves greedily, but came up short. It didn’t make sense. What was the secret to the rust free goods, we wondered?</p><p>A voice from behind entered the room. It was the restorer, Jiro “Paint Huffer” Hayashida, and he was very displeased at this band of complete assholes who were trying to loot his vintage imported POR-15. “We just throw our cars away every two years, boys.”</p><p>“Also,” he said, cocking a flawless restoration of a Heian-period tactical shotgun, “we’re not stupid enough to salt the roads.”<br/></p>

<p>Sure, they tell you that forming a street gang and striving to control the Upper Northeast Side is frowned upon in polite society, but I never went to a dinner party where they <i>didn’t</i> want to hear more about the cop that I shot.</p><p>Our gang was named the Honda Botherers. We were consumed by those backwards-spinning, unusually tall powerplants, mostly because that was the thing to do and we saw a Vin Diesel movie (The Iron Giant) in the budget theatres about it. The biggest challenge we faced was trying to keep our cars off the radar of the local five-oh, and that was particularly difficult because of our founder, Big Greg, and his taste for low-weight synthetic oil.</p><p>Nowadays, zero-weight oil is easy to get in any parts store, bordello or vending machine that you find on the side of the road. But back then, there was just one place to go for that sweet, sweet Idemitsu: the docks. In the shipping containers that littered the coast, Big Greg could find all the zero-twenty he would need to keep his D-series running, and it really wasn’t that much, like three and a half quarts including the filter.</p><p>Everything would have gone great if it weren’t for Big Greg’s other vice: the Miracle Psychic’s Network. For only hundreds of pennies a minute, you could talk to a varying-degrees-of-real psychic who could tell you about how your future was going to unfold. Big Greg, it seems unnecessary to say, was on the line with those guys almost every minute, putting the gang’s finances in jeopardy. Small Anthony, our accountant, often mentioned his concerns with it, which made for an uncomfortable series of meetings of the board of directors in that time period. But I digress.</p><p>Bolstered by a psychic prediction of his success, Big Greg led us into the docks, directly into a sting operation. I didn’t want to shoot a cop, but then he told me that he didn’t really care for the Del Sol and that shit is just wrong. It’s almost a convertible!</p>

<p>Scoring free food from politicians’ glad-handing breakfasts was something I had a lot of experience in, but working as a political fixer? That was a whole other field, though one I found immediately that I had a lot of talent in.</p><p>My district’s city councillor, an incompetent boob even in those times, had watched me devour stack after stack of free flapjacks before getting back in line, getting another helping, and storing them in a hidden pocket of my jacket “for later.” I would find out later that this open and brazen act of graft and contempt for the public purse served as almost a mating display for the kind of politician who would become my bread and butter.</p><p>When I returned to the faux mini-haybale that was pulling duty as my seat at the breakfast, he was already sitting there. He had a proposal to make.</p><p>It turned out that he really hated the bike lanes of my fair city, and while I had no particular opposition to them myself, it was when he told me that it was inconveniencing my fellow <i>car owners</i> that I became personally invested in it. He also offered me a lot of money out of the council slush fund, which I assure you by no means influenced me.</p><p>A few days later, after reviewing the by-laws and tri-laws of my town, I had hit upon the perfect strategy. There was no restriction against using a <i>powered</i> bicycle in the bike lane, said my crooked almost-lawyer friend, and so I hit up eBay and the local markets for the parts I would need to assemble my great work.</p><p>The campaign was a huge success: it turned out that all it takes to really discourage bicyclists from using the bike lane is to drop a single uninterrupted burnout over six blocks long during the middle of their commute. After that day, the bike lane was crowded with homemade ghettocycles of every description, clogging the air with two-stroke smoke.</p><p>As for that city councillor? I hated the very idea of my work going to benefit someone so undeserving, so during a tour of City Hall I wandered a little bit off the tour guide’s path and left some very suspicious two-stroke oil containers and “Scooters From Hell” gang cut on a certain desk. After the ethics investigation was over, I felt that I would make an excellent candidate for the upcoming byelection.</p><p>After all, I knew the most about the “bike lane problem.” From that position, I could finally get the city’s unreasonable bylaws regarding so-called “abandoned cars” lifted, or at least redirect the impound lot closer to my house. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.</p>

<p>It only occurred to me once we had finally been matched up with our tour guide that there had been absolutely no line waiting to get into the Honda museum. Surely, at the very least a platoon of bored schoolchildren would be willing to learn about their country’s very own Henry Ford and the majestic heights of mechanical engineering he had gotten up to?</p><p>I was just about to decide that we had come through some kind of special entrance for disgraceful foreigners, as was common in this part of Japan. This made me relax a bit, until we got to the part of the tour where they showed us the engines.</p><p>“Now, this is what the Americans call a <i>big block</i> Honda,” he said, gesturing to a small utility motor of some kind.<br/></p><p>“What displacement is a ‘big block’ Honda?” I asked quickly, hoping that perhaps his English was not good enough to continue this conversation and we could move on quietly to the really primo parts of the museum, where they showed us the CR-Vs.<br/></p><p>“It is&hellip; two point two liters,” he whispers into my ear, but not quietly enough for the other scattered visitors in the tour group, who gasp as if dying for air. One woman is frantically fanning her husband, who has fainted at the mention of this massive powerplant.</p><p>“It is the biggest engine in the country. We had to get special clearance to install it in our museum. It has been disarmed with a special American feature which makes sure no engine can ever run again.” he continues.<br/></p><p>“What American feature is that?” I ask, kicking myself for becoming that foreign rube who always asks stupid questions to the tour guide.</p><p>“Oh, a Ford electrical system,” he says, and swings his arm behind the display, where we can clearly see a collection of undersized wire that is actively aflame.<br/></p>

<p>“We came to you because we knew there was nobody else we could hire,” the Toto executive insults me before issuing a neck-snapping series of bows in an attempt to win my agreement. He does, my firm handshake being returned with a sweaty palm. Toto has been getting their asses kicked across the Pacific Rim for the last five years, he explains. The Chinese have much cheaper toilets, and Toto needs someone who is willing to get the job done.</p><p>My team arrives, along with the corporate credit card, which I immediately clutch to my chest, warming it with my body heat as if I were a mother gorilla nursing her newborn babies. About a week later, and wholly coincidentally, we witnessed the arrival of a bundle of the cheapest cars on Tokyo Craigslist, already leaking their oil into the proud tarmac of the Toto parking lot.</p><p>Now that the basics of transportation and effective management were out of the way (Rule 1 of the Switch Management Industrial Concern’s Crimson Gold-level corporate training: buy a shitty car because it will make you pay attention on the ride in), it was time to fix our little problem with the toilets. We roped in some Americans for the focus group. Our thinking was that their failed state would soon need a series of new toilets now that the United Nations had managed to successfully recapture and construct an all-new, gleaming sewer system to provide them with the fresh water they had been lacking.</p><p>The average American wanted nothing more than sheer horsepower, they told us. Dense opiate-clogged dumps could disarm the greatest flushing achievements of humanity, some said. I must admit that I was myself motivated by the dream of showing all of those snooty engineers who told me that I didn’t actually have a degree (Rule 2: degrees are expensive; forged degrees cost much less) who really ruled the roost.</p><p>I’ll never forget the look of appreciation on the face of that first brave test-pilot who decided to take that first big shit. His last words to me, barely audible over the sound of the twin-supercharged bored 454 whose unearthly suction had ripped the colon from his frail body, leaving behind a gaping wound the size of a miniature Pinscher, were some I would treasure forever.</p><p>“It has just enough power,” he said, before dying.<br/></p>

<p>“You can park your bicycle in one of these unused startup cubicles,” says the office manager as he sweeps his arm across the vast expanse of failure which I have inherited at cut-rate prices. Sure, on paper, Seat Safety Switch Enterprises International LLC is a financial services corporation, but in actual fact (later proven by Federal attorneys) we just basically fleeced old people all day long and then blew the money on K-cars. This new development, however, made me think that perhaps I could be reducing my spend on garage space.</p><p>The next morning, I began my plan to smuggle in cars and park them in the cubes. It was harder than you’d think - cars are quite large, and the elevators were too small to hold even a 1970s “subcompact.” After writing some letters of anger towards the building management regarding their lack of respect for fat people got me nowhere, I decided on plan B - the freight elevator. Surely I could fit an early-model Civic in that.</p><p>At the freight elevator, I was again confronted by failure. Not only was the alley leading up to the loading dock pretty tight, but the guy working the dock said he didn’t even have any ramps for me to use to drive up the half a meter into the freight elevator. Plus, he claimed, laughing, he didn’t think the elevator could carry that much in one shot. It was that mention of ‘one’ that gave me my next idea.</p><p>Whipping out the handy-dandy metric socket set strapped to my body, I began to dismantle the car. Over the next few weeks, and thanks to the lack of busybody suburbanite neighbours calling in “derelict cars” in the inner city, I was able to smuggle in pieces of the car. One morning, it would be a headlight, and then on the next smoke break, an entire sunroof assembly.</p><p>At last, it was done. I reassembled the car, smiling at the fact it would now be safe from the elements. Plus, now I could get through those boring conference calls with wailing retirees telling me about their dead loved ones through choked sobs by doing an oil change or two.</p><p>The next Monday, I came into the office to find my car was gone. My first instinct was to call building management, but all they sent was a large Swedish man who pointed out the hole that was torn through the 27th through 23rd floors, and the chunk of crumpled Japanese steel on the 22nd floor. I looked at this, and then asked the man if he had any extra Volvos he wanted to get rid of, because I needed a new car for work.</p>

<p>“Caller, you’re on the air with <i>Car Moan</i>.” I was on the air! With a radio show! Other commuters without good stereos would be listening to me!<br/></p><p>“Uh yeah, I got a problem with my 1995 Honda Today, it’s making some kind of weird sound.” I said, trying not to freak out at the tape-delay of my own voice.<br/></p><p>“Well, that’s what we’re here to fix for you, caller. Can you describe it?”<br/></p><p>“It’s sort of this otherworldly screeching sound, as if a man is trapped within a boundless plane of unbearable physical and mental anguish.”<br/></p><p>“Hm, could be a pebble in the brake rotor.”<br/></p><p>“No, I’ve checked that. The brake rotors are missing altogether, and there is a wafting scent of brimstone. If I get in really close I can hear a faint chuckling sound coming from my front CVs, like Satan himself has taken up residence within my transaxle.”<br/></p><p>“We get this a lot, caller, and the good news is we have a fix. You’re going to need to drive your car to a priest and have them splash it with holy water. That sound good?”<br/></p><p>“No sir, my car has so much rust that introducing any new moisture will probably just rot the panels out faster. I cover it in those little desiccant packets you get with bags of beef jerky when I have to park it outside and it might rain.”<br/></p><p>“Well, caller, you’ve made my life extremely difficult. You and the rest of your wretched kind, stealing this earth from my army of fallen angels.”</p><p>I hung up. I had been listening to this program for long enough to know that there was no point arguing with Satan’s racist AM-radio dad. Maybe the Shinto priest down the street had some of those cherry blossom petals he could throw at my car instead?</p>

<p>Everyone has pretty much built a time machine in their basement by now, but they always end up dismantling it when their descendants from a distant hell-future come barging through the time portal to warn them about some dire threat that only they can prevent. Most people just sigh, maybe roll their eyes, shove their guest back through the portal and turn the machine off.</p><p>What my descendant had to say was something quite interesting. Through parched lips and gasps, he warned me: “self-driving tow trucks will change beater ownership <i>forever</i>.”</p><p>He was right, you know. Of course, he said a lot of other bullshit - they always do, about the polar ice caps and the unstoppable solar storms that would ravage the Earth’s surface when the magnetic field inverts, a real obsession with these motherfuckers - but the tow truck thing <i>checked out</i>. When I kicked off a startup and hired me guys who were just a little too dumb to get hired at NASA to work there, we had a really good prototype within weeks.</p><p>Now there was no fear to commuting in a poorly maintained car. Should a balljoint break, an axle explode or a floorpan tear open, ejecting you onto the highway at cruise speed, you just tapped a button on what was left of your smartphone and your robot pal would show up to tow you and the wreckage all the way to work. Most times, you wouldn’t even be <i>late</i>!</p><p>There was something missing, though. Maybe it was that my work clothes no longer smelled like AC compressor oil, but eventually I came to miss the old way that things used to be, when you were a little uncertain about whether you would make it. Had my ancestors felt the same way when they formed human society and huddled in warm buildings rather than maybe die from some kind of bird that shit in their open mouth while they slept, causing them to choke to death?</p><p>Luckily, the startup hadn’t gone too far, selling only a few prototypes to the most devoted of beater owners. What I hadn’t realized was, as a weird, rare automobile, the self-driving tow trucks themselves would become objects of weird shitbox owner desire. I hoped that the community’s attempts to tinker with the sentience matrix wouldn’t cause them to take over the world, like the other guy who showed up in my basement that morning said they might.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d heard Hitler&rsquo;s boys were looking to get their dicks wet with some kind of occult witchcraft in the deadlands of Africa to power their new line of affordable commuter cars, but nobody could have believed what they were really up to. They sent in the best of the best, and then they sent in me when they didn’t hear from those guys for awhile. The horror of what I saw will stay with me until the end of my days.</p><p>Imagine, if you will, a normal car, but with the engine in the <i>wrong end</i>. To compensate, they put this cockamamie arrangement of springs and linkages so that the sucker who bought it could still work the transmission and throttle.</p><p>The worst part of it all was that our spies had alluded to it not even needing <i>water cooling</i>. It was all true, I realized in horror: those crazy Nazi bastards were piping white-hot exhaust through the body of the car to keep the driver warm. There was just no way you could compete against purestrain craziness like that.</p><p>I could not live with myself unless I did something right here and right now, even if it would blow my cover. Allied command would just need to suck it up. Opening the door to the meeting room, I adopted my best fake German accent and mechanical engineering persona. Sabotaging this whole project would save millions of lives, I was convinced.</p><p>“Hey, dumbkopfs,” I barked. “Have you thought about making the windshield washers run off the spare tire’s air pressure?”<br/></p><p>The junior engineers assembled immediately began taking notes, grinning at the pure brilliance of their coworkers. If they only knew. Giddy on my initial success, I decided to see if I could go two for two.</p><p>“And make sure to make friends with those Bosch people. They’re going to go far with that whole mechanical fuel injection thing,” I said, trying not to laugh.<br/></p>

<p>The Oscar Meyer corporation very rarely had cause to hire a man with my particular set of skills, or so they would like you to believe. Beloved American corporations generally didn’t want to see their consultants splashed across the front page of foreign newspapers, arrested for espionage, incitements to riot, gun running, quintuple homicide, that kind of thing. They didn’t want me to do any of that fun stuff this time, though. I was supposed to track down a lost Wienermobile.</p><p>My handlers didn’t want to go into too much detail about the circumstances of the hot-dog-shaped motorhome’s disappearance, preferring instead to keep me in the dark as to which boardroom player’s teenage nephew was the one who left the mustard bus double parked and got it impounded.</p><p>From there, as far as I could see, it was auctioned, sold to an eccentric foreign billionaire, and then departed the country via a container ship of many names flying under a flag of convenience. It would take every favour I had saved up over the years to figure out where the mystery meatmobile had gone, and there would always be the risk that some artificial byproduct of the process would come find me before I found him.</p><p>After a few months of hunting, my research assistant found it. On loan from the university from her computer science internship or some other boring nerd shit, she had hijacked an NSA spy satellite to check the world’s docks for something that looked like a hot dog. Thanks to a series of well-timed white papers and a lucky shot of a stevedore hooning the sausage down by the Seine, we knew it was in Paris.</p><p>Once we had wheels-up, I passed into a deep slumber and awoke in the City of Lights, the airplane steward poking me repeatedly as if to ensure that I was alive. He jumped when my eyes flicked open and I arose smoothly from the seat to take my Constitutionally protected carry-on with me as I exited the plane.</p><p>My ride to the docks could be nothing other than my former comrade Jacques’ up-armoured 2CV. Naturally, all that extra weight from the inch-thick steel plating and plexiglass windows required the factory two-banger to get juiced up with port nitrous injection and a big-bore kit the size of a roasting hog. I found it immensely satisfying, working the big steering wheel and the farmboy suspension across the Parisian cobblestones to my quarry.</p><p>When we got there, we could scarcely believe it. Aghast at such an affront to cuisine, the French had worked quickly to convert the Wienermobile. It now existed as the Gitainesmobile, and bored beret-clad teenagers handed out free wine and packs of smokes to thrilled schoolchildren.</p>

<p>When it came to importing used car parts, I guess you could say I had a <i>yen</i> for getting them from Japan. Ow, stop hitting me.</p><p>I was sitting in my drawing room, entertaining the societal elites which had dropped by to hear another one of my patented tall tales. They seemed particularly captivated by this one, and just as I was preparing to strike, viper-like, with the reveal that a Datsun B210 “Honey Bee” edition did not come with a trip odometer or armrests, I received a phone call from my assistant.</p><p>Picking it up, and casually dismissing my guests with a wave of my hand as I exited the parlour and tucked myself into the main-floor front parts storage room, I asked what was so important. It turned out it was a website that would sell you used parts, <i>from Japan</i>. For cheap.</p><p>I got immediately upon the in-home intercom, and ordered my assistant’s assistant to spin up the computing turbines and issue a full speed order to the engine room. Within seconds, the resplendent brass piping of my home was pouring TCP packets in the form of white-hot steam from the mysterious Orient.</p><p>Months later, I was bankrupt, my house filled to the brim with C-condition scratch-and-dent discount wheel sets and RX-8 body parts despite not owning an RX-8. No longer would high society consider me their equal, as my moss-overgrown manse poured discount swaybar kits and half-broken Teins from its very windows.</p><p>I would have had my revenge on those bastards at Croooober for ruining my life, but every time I went to their website to figure out where they lived, I just ended up spending another three thousand bucks at Up Garage.</p>

<p>Standing at the coffee maker in my engine assembly clean room slash kitchenette I hear a soft cough from outside, as if issued by an asthmatic kitten or an ashamed child. I think nothing of it; the pollution index is very high in my neighbourhood for some reason, the health and safety people keep telling me as they show up on my front porch, clad in gas masks. Then I hear it again, a soft, lilting cough, like a two-stroke engine that just refuses to turn over.</p><p>Down the block, around the corner, and down two more blocks is a neighbour whom I have never met. He is struggling to bring to life a vintage Lawn-Boy two-stroke lawnmower, and is surprised that I was able to hear the sounds of impending combustion striving to be born from such a range through the sheets of rusted take-off quarter panels that form the walls of my home. Before he is able to speak any further, I have already unthreaded the white-hot plug from its sleeve with my bare hands and begun reading the porcelain for clues.</p><p>Ah, the spark plug: so cheap, so essential, yet also so complex. A million lives were snuffed out in pursuit of this glorious piece of machinery. I begin to tear up a little at the thought of this height of human achievement, which makes my neighbour involuntarily back off a few steps, no doubt trying to remember where his wife and kids are currently and if he can get to them quickly if I turn violent. This is a reaction I have seen before, and so I smile gently while pointing to the fuel-drenched plug, its gap blown out so wide that you could fit a Pekinese in it. Nobody is afraid of a teacher, unless they were raised Catholic.</p><p>By the time the police arrive, I have a healthy-running Lawn Boy trimming this guy’s front yard with impunity. The more senior of the officers stares at me over the barrel of his service-issue sidearm. I am familiar with the hostage protocol from other misunderstandings such as this in the past, and have a go-to line for disarming the responding officers.</p><p>“Check out how good this cut is. They don’t make ‘em like that anymore.” I say.<br/></p><p>The officer looks at the cut, then at the mower, then at me, and lowers his gun, against his best instincts.</p><p>“Hell of a cut,” he says, nodding, before getting back into his patrol car and leaving. I note a distinct misfire on #6 that might be due to worn coilpacks on his service Crown Vic, something which I’ll have to fix the next time I am in the station. After all, spark plugs deserve the best we can give them.<br/></p>

Then, you can park it in the police station lockup to keep it safe!</p><p>There is no such thing as “SAE bolts” or “inches.” Insist that your supplier give you the “good metric shit” or you’ll take your business elsewhere, especially if your car is old and American. It’s the only way they’ll learn!</p><p>Henry Ford once invented the modern-day automobile by using one weird old trick discovered by a farmer.

<p>I knew that my grassroots letter-writing campaign had gotten traction when the CEO of Canadian Tire’s junior executive assistant wrote back to me. Sure, it was just to tell me that Sandy McTire was not a real person and to stop bothering him about my idea to install a nitrous refilling system in the repair shop, but you take your victories where you can.</p><p>After I had finished penning the traditional apology letters for having bothered a fellow Canadian, I thought about what I should do for the rest of the day. Then I realized I had to go to Canadian Tire to buy some bullshit and groaned.</p><p>There was something about Canadian Tire that held a special appeal in my heart, even if it was just because it was the only place that sold cheese-grade pseudo-stainless metric bolts on Sunday night as I was thrashing together another piece of shit and needed to replace the fasteners that I had dropped inside a frame rail or other convenient pocket dimension [Hawking, 1996]. This time, it was that I had to get a tube of Shoe Goo to fill the rapidly enlarging hole in the floorpan of my Valiant.</p><p>It took a long time to go through the store, not least because of the good hour I spent holding a door for other customers. I would be just about ready to go in myself, and then see a car approaching on the highway off-ramp just down the way. My guarding provided an essential service: it would be rude to just shut the door in their faces when they were only half a kilometer away.</p><p>After it was all done, I looked at the CSA-grade composites job I had done, mixing the silicone goo in with shards of the government-subsidized Barenaked Ladies albums that littered parking lots throughout the land. It gleamed and glimmered in the fifteen minutes of sunlight we would get at this, the height of the summer, and I smiled gently, hoping that I could fend off the road salt for one more year before it claimed my Vally forever.</p><p>On the way home, I passed a man ranting and raving on a traffic island in both official languages, as was the law. His signboard complained that his government cheque didn’t buy enough subsidized narcotics anymore, thanks to the Conservatives. I waved to him, apologizing for having interrupted his view of the highway. He apologized to me for burdening me with a more nuanced understanding of local issues.</p><p>As the sun set over my home, and the frost wolves bayed at the rising moon, I huddled within my sod cabin for warmth and praised the Trudeaus for allowing me to survive the death panels for one more year. It was the greatest Canada Day ever.</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t know this, but the first-generation Geo Metro was actually the tipping point for the complete and total destruction of the North American way of life. We had welcomed it into our badge-engineering projects with such hubris, thinking erroneously that Hamamatsu would not have a chessmaster pulling puppet strings behind the scenes like some kind of mixed metaphor.</p><p>When the first ones arrived, we sneered at their three-cylinder sewing machine engines and their general sealed-beam cheapness and lack of comport. But there was a charm, and one of the men in the receiving department that I had worked with was probably the first to fall under its sway. We ignored the warning signs; when he started disappearing from work for ever-longer periods to pick up minibike turbochargers to fit to his personal factory-discount Metro, nobody raised an alarm.</p><p>Even later, when his urges became harder to control, made him act out in increasingly erratic fashion, we didn’t really care. Part of that was the General Motors way of life (our motto: “Didn’t See Nothin.”) But we really should have done <i>something</i> when he stole all that paperwork from headquarters and started forging signatures to approve a whole new brand, just for Canada, for <i>more Geos</i>. As the Asunas rolled off the ships, piling the docks with ever-tinier engines, we realized then that it was too late.</p><p>Those bastards at Suzuki walked right over us, and what’s worse, they held the door open for the rest of their Japanese friends to come join the party. Within weeks, we had heard that Isuzu had joined, and they even brought their weird friend Subaru. The boardroom couldn’t respond fast enough, buying first Opel and then Saab in the hope of distracting the Japanese engineers with high-grade European weirdness, but they didn’t even flinch before dropping a badge-engineered Impreza in our laps and telling us to sell it.</p><p>A few months later, a grinning squadron of Toyotaites raised the Pontiac Vibe over Times Square. Nobody but us knew what it meant. We just continued wallpapering our nuclear survival bunkers with GM employee shares.</p>

&ldquo;THE WEINERMOBILE&rsquo;S HERE,&rdquo; screams the peasantry before the squealing of the tires pushes my tinnitus into a range where it can no longer decipher human speech. There, at last, amongst the smell of grilling meats (Hankook-brand), I am at peace.</p><p>It’s not because of any silly grudge against the Oscar Meyer corporation that I did such a thing. In the years since my initial humiliation, I had convinced both myself and my court-ordered psychiatrist that I had overcome my rage at being passed over for Weinermobile driver in favour of my more handsome, more charming, and dare I say, more Aryan classmates. No, this trip was not born of revenge, but of <i>celebration</i>.</p><p>Also, they left the Weinermobile running when they went in to hand those kids free hot dogs. Where was my free hot dog? I would have to get my joys another way.</p><p>As the smoke began to flash its usual blue and red lights, backlit by the quick-response squad of police officers that were always on notice to quell my <i>compulsions</i>, I still smiled. If there was a greater victory in life than stealing a truck shaped like a hot dog and doing an uninterrupted peel-out across an entire playground zone, I would never reach it.</p>

<p>Today on <i>Ventureline</i>, we talk to a group of entrepreneurs who promise to revitalize the dormant food truck industry. Later, we’ll also look into some boring business that turns a profit or something, who the fuck cares anymore.</p><p>We’re here today with Mr. Switch “El Switcho” Estevez, who is the inventor behind this new business. Can you describe it for us?</p><p>“Of course, Maurice. I thought, I sure would like a taco right now, but all the taco restaurants are far away, and all the taco trucks are either good ones at the junkyard or terrible ones in places where there are white people with money. What’s more, I didn’t want to spend all my time driving around in search of people who were willing to buy inauthentic Mexican food from a poorly-maintained Divco that shoots blue smoke from its dying Jimmy Six.”</p><p>“So that’s when I hit upon it. I would finally use this useless computer science degree and build an autonomous taco truck. The tacos would simply find <i>you</i>. After installing a few npm packages for product recommendations, I let go of the truck months ago and haven’t seen it since. But my bank account sure has. Care for some cocaine?”</p><p>“Later, El Switcho, we’re going to visit your truck right now, and see how it has revolutionized the twin economic drivers of eating bad food and paying way too much.”</p><p>“Ah, here it is. And here’s a future customer, walking down the street.”</p><p>HEY I KNOW YOU WANT THIS FUCKING TACO</p><p>No, no, I don’t! I’m not hungry!</p><p>LOOK, YOU’RE PAYING FOR THIS TACO WHETHER YOU EAT IT OR NOT. I’VE SEEN YOU BEFORE. YOU LIVE AT 123 BELLWETHER STREET, JUST DOWN THE CORNER. YOU HAVE TWO DOGS AND A SECURITY SYSTEM THAT IS AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OUT OF DATE. IT WOULD REQUIRE FEWER THAN A TEN KILOMETER PER HOUR IMPACT AT MY CURRENT MASS TO BREAK DOWN YOUR FRONT DOOR AND PENETRATE INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE YOU SIT AT YOUR MORNING BREAKFAST. A BREAKFAST, I SHOULD ADD, THAT COULD BE ONE OF MY EXCELLENT TACOS. CAPICHE?</p><p>Oh, oh god. I’ll pay anything. Just go away.</p><p>“Some revolutionary stuff there. You must be proud.”</p><p>“I’m not. Did you see the little stutter it had when it was trying to track the speed of that jogger? I think that’s probably a floating-point inaccuracy, or a bad wheel bearing. Either way, now I have to tear this fucking thing apart to fix it again.”</p>

<p>Back when I was actively driving, they used to call me the Warranty Winner. You could put anything in front of me: CarMax unlimited used warranties, new-car limiteds, new-car <i>powertrain and corrosion</i>, even those scammy-assed extended warranties. What you’d pay me for is that I would rapidly rack up enough damages and unexpected failures that the warranty would pay for itself in minutes.</p><p>People angered with dealerships would call me up, I’d take their Audi Q5 for a quick jaunt to get ice cream, and return with a piston embedded in the windshield, rod and all. They’d offload a pittance into my hands as I stood there, a slight nod to the tow-truck driver responding. I knew every driver, of course, as you did in a career such as this.</p><p>Once, I was working out of Houston on a tough case. My client had purchased a C5 Corvette from a buy-here-pay-here lot and paid them almost the entire value of the car at auction to furnish them with an “extended warranty.” The only thing extended about it was the amount of fine print at the bottom, excluding the warrantor from pretty much anything that could possibly go wrong with a car. But they forgot one thing: the cigarette lighter, and that’s what I focused on.</p><p>Weaving my fingers in the pattern of the strange magicks taught to me by the witch coven I had been raised from childhood in after a strange paperwork mix-up at the nunnery, I let the Corvette’s generous alternator push a few too many amps through the under-specified twelve-volt accessory plug. Within minutes, I was lighting my cigarette inside the car, using the roaring flames that had engulfed the steering column.</p><p>Nowadays, there’s not so much work for me. Cars are so good now that nobody really wants to go through the trouble of having shop techs rip apart their three-year-old Lexus to replace nine-tenths of it, especially since all the panels rattle like crazy afterward. I spend most of my days at the mall, holding a fishbowl, waiting for customers at the Apple store to pick up their extended warranties.</p>

<p>Sure, most people wouldn’t drive a prepared vintage Trans Am race car through the Wendy’s drive through. Those people won’t know the joy of trying to quickly unclip the window net so you can get the colon-scraping joy that is a Revenge of Baconator combo meal. What kind of life is that?</p><p>As I leave the parking lot, I encounter the first big problem. There are no cupholders. For your average rookie in their <i>Toyota Celsior</i>, this might be a problem. Not for me; I have become an experienced traveler in every sense of the word by now, and expertly wedge the large drink cup in the gap between the A-pillar-bar of the cage and the windshield, without looking.</p><p>If I don’t really climb on the throttle, I figure, there’s no way that lid is coming off. Luckily, with six hundred flame-spitting horsepower on tap from the righteously-cammed big-block, there’s no need to use much of that throttle to put a Honda Odyssey bound for hot yoga back into their rightful place in the animal kingdom of motorsport.</p><p>The Javelin’s normal induction noise becomes a sharp roar as I merge into traffic. It is now that I realize my folly: although the vintage Firestone race tires are period-correct, after fifty years of sitting in a shed in the desert they no longer have the traction they once boasted. I am already working the wheel to compensate for the squirm in the rear end, try to keep the ship from coming all the way around, but I have badly miscalculated.</p><p>In my hubris, I have forgotten about <i>lateral Gs</i>.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, with growing horror, I see my lunch combo tip ever so slightly onto the passenger-side race bucket, disgorging white-hot french fries into the interior. I sigh. Even with a stripped and caged race interior, I know it is impossible to retrieve all of these golden-brown explorers from a car interior once they have been spilled. Future generations will be digging dessicated fries out from under the interior, wondering if maybe Mark Donohoe ate at Wendy’s between laps of the prototype.</p>

<p>If you or someone you know has been bothered by a loud exhaust, surprised by a hood-mounted LED-backlit nitrous purge valve or annoyed by an external wastegate that vents to atmosphere, we can help. Attorneys are standing by now to issue an unprecedented class-action lawsuit against sound waves. These less-silent killers sneak into your ear canal and cause damage to your brain, forcing permanent body pain in a way that scientists do not yet believe.</p><p>Our research further proves that oil companies are in competition to produce ever-louder gasoline, which when burned in internal combustion engines, results in unprecedented exhaust loudness. This, they feel, gives them a competitive edge by giving their buyers a sense that their cars have become “more powerful.”</p><p>We believe that by 2020, gasoline will burn so loudly that no muffler will be able to contain its burly roar. That’s why in Phase 2 of this campaign, we plan on suing the concept of gasoline, focusing on bringing suit directly to the estate of the dinosaurs who died to produce it. What will <i>your</i> children think when they ask you why you stood by and did nothing at this critical juncture?</p><p>In Phase 3 of our suit, we plan to take to court the Japanese auto giant Mazda, not just because their cars featuring Wankel-style rotary engines are very loud but also because their head exhaust engineer laughed really hard at us on a conference call last week. Our researchers have identified multiple critical moments at which Mazda has been ignorant of the need for peace and quiet, such as the time Bob Hall once accidentally pushed a stapler off the desk in his office and it made a loud noise when it hit the floor (we have tapes, Bob).</p><p>Call today, and ensure a quieter tomorrow. Just look at this, our prototype cityscape with entirely electric car- AW FUCK I DIDN’T EVEN HEAR THAT THING COMING. JESUS CHRIST MY LEG.</p>

<p>I was at work the other day, and I got a phone call. Not recognizing the number, I wanted to ignore it at first. Human curiosity got the better of me, though, and so I was rapidly mashing my thumb into the green button in the hope of connecting before the screen froze again. It was the RockAuto guy, who I had previously only known as “the RockAuto guy,” but who was now introducing himself as Glenn.</p><p>“Hey, you should really get that corner of your foundation checked out,” said Glenn.<br/></p><p>I was perplexed. Glenn was a guy who delivered my RockAuto parts every Tuesday through Friday, only occasionally taking a day off from hefting radiators onto my porch. Was he really at my place often enough that he remembered things about it?</p><p>“Also, Ms. Johnson down the block is having a lot of trouble with her weeping tile, so I bet your house has the same problem, since it’s about the same age. You need to take good care of this place, dude.” he said.</p><p>Slowly, it came to dawn on me that Glenn had probably been to my house more often than I had.</p><p>There were clues before, sure: how he had worked out the perfect hiding spot for parts of every definition, the occasional dandelion I would find pulled from my lawn when I returned home, the corpse of the burglar across town who had choked to death on a fistful of RockAuto magnets before having his body unceremoniously dumped behind the old UPS sorting depot.</p><p>I was about to cuss out Glenn, to tell him not to get overly familiar with a man he had only occasionally met in person, but then I realized an opportunity.</p><p>The next day, my phone rang again. It was Glenn.</p><p>“Hey buddy, thanks for putting that treadmill in front of your place. I don’t get enough walking when I have to work, since everyone’s sidewalk is so short in your neighbourhood.”<br/></p><p>I looked at the power-generation screen’s notice that the treadmill had generated about sixteen watts, and smiled. I was going to get <i>back</i> those shipping fees one way or another, motherfuckers.</p>

<H1>Switch’s Film Answers, Issue 1</H1>
<p><b>Q: </b>We are watching San Andreas and aside from it being total garbage I can&rsquo;t stop thinking who in their right mind divorces The Rock.</p><p><b>A:</b> Well imagine you&rsquo;re home, you&rsquo;re kinda depressed, your boss yelled at you when you were doing whatever the fuck the Rock’s ex-wife was doing in the movie. You look outside, and your husband is doing cartwheels out in the backyard while telling a GQ reporter how much he loves life.</p><p>The next morning you hear that one of your old college friends has died. Your husband still hasn&rsquo;t come inside from last night: he&rsquo;s recruited a group of neighbourhood children to see if he is stronger than 20 kids or not. So far he is winning, and catapults a three year old against your bay window with an audible *smack*. You do the dishes.</p><p>At last you can take it no more and charge outside to confront him. He has to be there for you emotionally, there has to be some private inner life, you scream. He looks at you with the cocked-head glance of a Labrador retriever, trying to parse your emotional anguish. Somehow you can&rsquo;t stay angry at him. you want him to run for president, and tell him so. He does.</p><p>Two years into the campaign, on election night, he loses New Hampshire, which should have been a safe get. You want to scream at him. You can tell his campaign advisor also wants to yell at him, but god damn it, you just can&rsquo;t come around to do it. He responds by charging out of the room and outrunning a passenger airliner on his way to New Hampshire, where he launches a charm offensive so effective that the surviving citizenry decide to burn the electoral office to the ground and have a re-vote. He&rsquo;s the president now, and you are still kind of depressed because now he&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> do the dishes.</p><p>After an unprecedented six terms, he finally wanders away from the White House on a field trip to NASA and becomes the first president to go into space. He thinks it&rsquo;s awesome and doesn&rsquo;t come back for awhile. In the meantime you feel his hold on you slipping, as if it only works at a certain range. Before he can come back, you quickly file divorce papers, having them Fedexed to his orbital fortress. You can barely look at the Skype images of his zero-gravity tears floating in front of his perfect face, but at last now it is done. You hide in mozambique for a year.</p><p>However, every man you encounter is both ugly and non-charming. You come across a homeless man in the Metro that you think you might be able to talk to, but it turns out he is actually pretty ugly. It dawns on you that the only reason you ever talked to anyone else was because being around The Rock gave you this sort of unnatural charm and confidence, like it rubbed off on you. You develop a drinking problem and are eventually fired from your job at the Mozambique Walmart.</p><p>Eventually you hear that your ex-husband has found a new joy in life, flying a helicopter to save people who crash their Subaru Foresters in the woods. It is the perfect job for him, you think, remembering the time he picked up a dead squirrel from the roadside and smiled at it, healing it perfectly of all wounds. that dead squirrel still lives now; that was 20 years ago. You decide you can move back to the greater Los Angeles area now, and that’s when the movie begins.<br/></p>

<p>“I feel this vibrating joy resonating through my body. It’s an almost sexual thrill when I can finally add up enough damage to total out a Smart Car or a PT Cruiser. Never felt anything like it, never will again, I reckon.”<br/></p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: That’s the voice of my friend, Percival Ramirez, a professional insurance adjuster. Late last June we had a gap in the schedule around now so I decided to book all my friends to come into the studio and tell me about their jobs, here on the radio.</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: Pleasure to be here, Ira.</p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: I’ve been wondering, when you go to total out a car, how often are the owners of PT Cruisers, Smart Fortwos or Mercedes B-classes overjoyed that you are taking their hateful charge from them?</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: Well, Ira, as you know, everyone has owned at least one car that they hate, even you -</p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: I myself have never owned a car, having been imbued with no legal personhood due to the vagaries of the artificial insemination project that birthed me in the bowels of the NPR headquarters. You know this, Percy.</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: Uh, and so, they - if I had to describe the sensation, it’s like having a tumour excised from your body, the relief of seeing that lump of cancerous flesh thrown into a trash bin and spat upon by the surgeon. Sometimes I get told that I save lives.</p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: But not everyone is happy that you are rescuing them from this awful life of kowtowing to the worst cars ever made?</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: No, not at all. You see, the owners of these cars are often mentally ill to start with. It’s how they got them in the first place. Their identities are wrapped up in the idea of faux wood panelling stickers and PT Cruiser owner meets and peeling white paint over an asthmatic four, wheezing its way to an early grave. It’s tragic, and it never stops breaking my heart when I see it.</p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: What do you do then? Surely it’s not just a normal “I think my car is worth more than you’re offering” deal?</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: I kill them. On the spot. Sell their teeth on the side.</p><p><b>Ira Glass</b>: You can do that?</p><p><b>Percival Ramirez</b>: Nobody ever reads the policy before they sign it.</p>

<p>No, I had no interaction with Russian cars in the days leading up to the judging of the annual Concours. They were two-strokes? It is odd that I would not notice that, I agree, but I maintain that I have no recollection of seeing any two-stroke vehicles other than those minty Trabants, and those are East German, <i>sir</i>.</p><p>Push-button automatic transmissions, you say? I do not recall such a thing happening to me, and had I seen it, I would probably have told everyone about it immediately, as is bylaw since the Dart Act of 1967. Given my extensive club-legal background as an autocrosser, I agree that I would know all potential loopholes such as these.</p><p>I <i>did</i> tell everyone about it? No, I have no recollection of filming that three hour video where I went over every aspect of the ZIL, from its charming hand-radiused pseudo-decorative parcel shelf to the jaunty yet imposing angle of the rear greenhouse kick. None whatsoever.</p><p>Gentlemen, I feel strongly that this is a kangaroo court motivated by political reasons to find me in fault of club bylaws that were not meant to be interpreted in this way. There is simply no truth to this slander that the Soviets have promised me a set of minty Lada Niva quarter panels if I play ball. If my Fiat-loving predecessor had push-button automatic transmissions, you’d throw him a parade.</p>

<p>When I first proposed a bill demanding that all owners of Mercedes B-classes be rounded up and executed, I caught a lot of heat for it from caucus. They couldn’t imagine that such a flagrantly anti-capital bill would be bipartisan, no matter how much I crowed about it. “Hell,” my chief of staff said, “I’m not even sure it’s <i>uni</i>partisan.” Then I threw him out a second storey window, because I’ve got no room in my administration for guys who want to drink the haterade. That put the rest of them in line.</p><p>It’s easy to get legislation on the move: the first step, I say, talking to the camera, is to get the votes whipped. I immediately presented the key opponents of the initiative with a series of gifts: OEM fanbelts for their air-cooled Volkswagens, detailing supplies for their water-cooled ones, and a junkyard two-for-one coupon to the weird guy in the back who drove a Simca to work.</p><p>The next step is negotiation. Just like buying a used car, you don’t want to come out with your bottom line. I pretended to act offended when I allowed them to wear me back down to only executing those Mercedes B-class owners we could <i>catch</i>. Now we had broad-spectrum approval, and there was some serious momentum behind the vote, especially when I told Bob Christfuck (R-VT) that he could repurpose the intercoolers from those Mercedes, give his constituents some jobs. Everyone likes jobs, Bob.</p><p>Sure, maybe I overreached a little bit trying to work in a few side deals here and there. Tim Nuclearapocalypse (I-CT) wanted a guarantee that his riding would get the contract for the bullets that we would pump into the screaming forms of these victim-consumers, but I was still pretty steamed at him for not sending me the link to that Craigslist ad for the Renault GTA fast enough the other day. My hubris there likely cost me at least one vote.</p><p>At last, like any good car deal, you are left with a useless piece of paper you signed and now regret. As the congressmen I had worked so hard to whip leaned back in their overstuffed desk chairs and listened to their constituents sing their praises over this glorious new bounty that will restore an American Golden Age, all I could see was that I forgot to include Smart Cars too.</p>

<p>When a man drives a luxury car, something changes within him. It’s been proven by science - luxury cars just behave more poorly in traffic. The scientific evidence falls way behind, however, when you ask the question of whether <i>old</i> luxury cars also turn their drivers into tremendous assholes. As part of our ongoing studies into asshole driver behaviour, we furnished a number of inexpensive 1980s sports-luxury vehicles and drove them to work a bunch.</p><p>Early indications are contraindicative of assholedom, as most 1980s luxury cars handle poorly and have almost no horsepower with which to break the rear tires free. Our test civilian, one Mr. P. F. Switchington, remarked that he was barely able to “light ‘em” rolling through a playground zone, and made a gesture of twirling fingers as if to emulate peel-outs for emphasis [Figure 1].</p><p>Many other candidates, not just the man we later had to sedate and then release back into his native environment of piles of car parts scattered haphazardly around an oil-stained garage floor, also expressed that they felt like they could be less of an asshole than normal when equipped with a car so incapable. In fact, our test group (equipped with a 2015 Corolla “S”) cut off semi-trucks with a much higher frequency, possibly because the Corolla’s reedy 1.8 liter engine is more capable of out-accelerating a fully laden tractor-trailer [Figure 2].</p><p>In a future experiment, we plan to invite our colleagues from the chemistry department to see how the application of a relatively innocuous greenhouse gas to the intake manifold of these rolling coffins improves their zero to sixty times.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for Henry Ford being a cheap douchebag, you’d all be using Robertson drive!” I shriek, slapping my palm on the sandwich sign board I am wearing for emphasis. Any casual observer of my antics could tell you that my attempt to go to the United States for an evangelical mission was not going very well so far.</p><p>Every year, hundreds of Canadians are selected by our government to travel to the Great Southward Satan and explain to them about the superiority of our way of life. Many stay behind, becoming comedians or famous movie stars, but I had no particular intention of remaining in a place that gets as hot in the winter as northern Montana. It’s just <i>too hot</i>, I moaned at two horrified women, who nearly drop their gym bags as they realize I am wearing nothing under the sandwich sign despite standing in four feet of snow.</p><p>I see a man going for the Home Depot entrance. Perfect, I think. He will listen to me, and then Trudeau will scramble the choppers to come pick me up, my mission a success. He sees me coming, and performs an expert dodge, avoiding eye contact for as long as possible. I reflexively apologize, which only serves to unnerve the man further. He leaps over the checkout counter, hiding behind the cashier, who makes a particular point of disabling the safety on her tactical-specification Glock 18. “Come vacation in Banff!” is all I can say as I quickly back away from the gritty reboot of Death Wish playing in the cashier’s head.</p><p>Back in the parking lot, I see another Canadian working the other side of the entrance. Also buck naked, he is barking something about Jim Carrey and the abstract concept of gravity, which he’s pretty sure was invented by a Canadian. I was going to have to get creative, really pull out the ace up my sleeve. Reaching out, I corner another man leaving his parked-across-four-lanes F150, fighting the urge to immediately apologize for making bodily contact with him.</p><p>“Motherfucker,” I bellow into his face, “we put a fucking <i>robot arm</i> on the Space Shuttle! It grabs <i>comets</i>!”</p><p>The man is unable to say something, staring directly into my eyes with the dilated pupils of a prescription-opiate addict. I now know exactly what to say to him to get my ride home.</p><p>“In Canada, you can get codeine over the counter!”<br/></p>

<p>For days now, I had been listening to the opinions of people with too much free time on my commute. After the ancient Lincoln I had been driving finally lost the use of its FM radio, I switched to the AM band, perhaps subconsciously out of some kind of misguided quest to better understand my neighbours.</p><p>“I think we should get rid of the mayor,” slurred one voice, in response to a poll about whether or not the local hockey team had committed a felony or just a misdemeanour what with all those Catholic high school girls. “He’s, he’s, he’s too God damned <i>high and mighty</i>. He’s all smug.” <br/></p><p>“Do you have an example of when he was acting smug?” asked the pollster, innocently. I was interested, too. After all, I had a slight inclination to vote against the mayor in the upcoming election, what with his newfound zeal for enforcing street parking regulations. He forced me to remember where I had parked all my cars lest the neighbours finally call the police.</p><p>“Uh, not really. It’s more of a feeling. I used to support him, but now he just treats you like you don’t matter if you don’t agree with his opinion,” continued the man, kicking off another two minutes of tape-delayed meandering into the weeds of local politics. By the time it was finished, I figured I had to say something.</p><p>Grasping the in-car cellular phone that was original equipment on the Lincoln, I immediately contacted the radio station switchboard. I was going to tell them <i>what I thought</i>, and I was going to expose this guy for the simpleton he was.</p><p>“Caller, you’re on the air. What do <i>you</i> think of the mayor?” chirped the pollster.<br/></p><p>Oh. Oh God. I was on the air. Where people can hear me. I need to make my opinion punchy. Have I taken too long already? Dead air is the killer. Oh God.</p><p>“Well, if you ask me,” I slurred, and recoiled in horror as the snail-speed version of my voice wound out of the radio before me - <i>is that what I really sound like to everyone else?</i> - “He should round up all the Mercedes B-class owners and fucking shoot them.”<br/></p><p>Dead silence. On the radio, the pollster was continuing on, having switched to a new citizen, with fresh ideas, almost immediately. She was doing an excellent job of pretending she cared about his feelings about bike lanes. I had a lot of momentum, though, and couldn’t stop now.</p><p>“In the back of the head,” I said to a dead line. “We’ll sell the cars for scrap and nationalize the profits. Full socialism now.”<br/></p>

<H1>Capsule History of the Ford Taurus, Part 2</H1>
<p>In <a href="http://seatsafetyswitch.com/post/161355227597/capsule-history-of-the-ford-taurus-part-1">Part 1</a>, we discussed the origins of the Ford Taurus, its otherworldly ability to absorb resale value, and the true motivations of the men behind its design and manufacture. Advanced students of 1980s domestic front-drive beater history will note the eerie parallels between the Taurus and the decline of Chrysler under its obsession with advanced cab-forward cloud car products, but the Taurus has a dark secret, one borne of badge engineering.</p><p>A digression, for those of you in the class who are new to automobile manufacturing and/or neoliberal capitalism in general: <i>badge engineering</i> is when automakers, believing that people treat brands as their “families,” attempt to inject a car that does not belong in that brand by changing the badging on the car and maybe adding leather seats or some shit. In this way, it is expected that the consumer who originally rejected the car will now identify it as one of their own and imprint upon it. You’ve probably seen it yourself: it is well known that the modern Chevrolet Corvette is actually a badge-engineered 1976 GMC K10, converted by painstaking artisans from a vast surplus of the trucks left on the docks by a shipping union strike in that year.</p><p>So it was with the Mercury Sable. There are absolutely no documents in Ford headquarters regarding the authorization of the creation of the Sable, and the office at Mercury HQ that used to hold documents of this sort had a suspicious electrical fire immediately after the first Sable rolled off the line. It is believed that the Sable was not directly responsible, though it was uncooperative during initial arson-squad interviews and maintained its silence.</p><p>Early reviewers of the Sable remarked upon its best-in-class ride handling, silent cabin, and pervasive odour of brimstone, the origin of which could never be placed. We attempted to interview those early reviewers for this piece, but none wished to be placed on the record. One source, speaking on a condition of firing a bolt-action carbine upon our researchers from his fourth-storey balcony, remarked that we would never take him back to those days. Quite so; time marches on, and it even did for the Sable.</p><p>It was only through the courageous actions of a group of teenage outcasts, awakened to their true inner power by the striving of a transfer student from another prefecture, that the Mercury Sable was able to be overcome in the winding tunnels of the Karmic Nightside which weaves its way through the very bedrock of our society. We owe a great debt to these teens.</p><p>Although the Sable was defeated in the end due to its great weakness to the hope that lies in the heart of rebellious teenagers, the Mercury brand limped along for several more decades. Rumours that a new Sable was introduced in the late 2000s as the American economy spontaneously collapsed are unfounded, and if you see one in the wild, do not interact with it.</p><p>In part three of this series, we’ll analyze the development of Project Taurus <i>X</i>, an failed experiment on the Ford Orbital Platform to merge the soul of the Ford Taurus with the bulk of a used Mazda Tribute in a dark quest to invent the crossover.</p>

<p>A sufficiently advanced bodge is indistinguishable from a correct repair, will read the five-inch-tall engraved letters on the door to my immense marble tomb. I was the kind of mechanic that, when he went to the Canadian Tire, was followed by a platoon of stockbrokers shrieking ‘BUY’ orders into their phones hoping to purchase stock in JB Weld for the inevitable bump.</p><p>Hack-jobbing together cars saved me a bunch of time, I reckoned, especially over those poor fools who agonized over inch-pound miscalibrations on their torque wrenches and spent hours trying to make sure their alignment was just so. Sure seemed to me like our cars hit the crusher around the same time, I would chuckle as I no-looking sawzalled a quarter panel window free from its moorings at the junkyard with my off hand.</p><p>That’s when it happened, though - I got myself a car that I <i>cared about</i>. I made the mistake, as many others had before me, of getting involved with the 1978 Chevrolet Nova, the finest automobile ever made. With production numbers only in the low hundreds of thousands over the car’s manufacturing life, I knew that every single one was a unique jewel, a gift from General Motors Themselves that must be protected at all costs.</p><p>Months later, when I realized that instead the car I Must Have was in fact a Triumph GT6, it became incredibly difficult to unload my concours-correct Nova for the one thousand four hundred dollars I felt my ambitious act of restoration deserved. That was it, I told the growing crack in the foundation of my garage, back to using bathroom caulking as Bondo.</p>

I will not tolerate you fabricating any further testimony to this Congress about your “government conspiracy.” Was it really so hard to just go on eBay and get a Chinese turbocharger or two, sir?<br/></p><p><b>1996 HONDA CIVIC EX</b>: My family was born with weak internals, we grew up very poor in the corner of a Canadian assembly plant.<br/><br/>My brother, he&hellip; experimented with nitrous. They all did, back then, because of the Hollywood glamour. We all wanted to be Vin Diesel’s base-model Civic, even if we were a sedan. I took the occasional 25-shot at parties, but my 185-width all seasons never hooked and I didn’t have the fuel system to inhale. It was just too hot for my rings.</p><p>We just never got the same opportunity that a rich, American-made car would have had to develop that low-end torque. But we worked hard, and made something of ourselves with the small amount of fuel and oil we were given by our owners.</p><p><b>VT CONGRESSMAN</b>: Sir, you and I both know that an impoverished youth in a foreign hellhole is no excuse for your continued activities as you enter the second decade of your useful life. I have been told by my aides that there are many after-warranty programs to equip small-displacement shitboxes like yourselves with eBay rods and forged Vitara-bore pistons. Surely you could have taken advantage of those?</p><p><b>1996 HONDA CIVIC EX</b>: No, Congressman. After my first owner, I was sold to someone who&hellip; used me for commuting duty.</p><p>(assorted gasps fill the Reading Room)</p><p><b>MI CONGRESSMAN</b>: How many more must there be like you out there? This is a nation of <i>torque</i>, God dammit.</p>

<p>Thank you for inviting me to give a TED Talk about my otherworldly ability to evade speed radar and the attentions of the police, despite it being well documented that my average speed is a large integer multiple of the posted limit at virtually all times. The apparent fact that the audience is almost completely made up of law enforcement personnel is also not lost on me, nor is it to my attorney, who wants to let the audience know that A) this information is for entertainment purposes only, and that B) he once punched out a great white shark with his bare hands so don’t fuck with us. Okay, now that the legalities are out of the way, let’s begin.</p><p>There are a lot of myths about the current state of velocity control legislation in the modern day, and let’s be honest, most of those myths are perpetuated by the ticket-defense industry, who is very interested in you <i>getting</i> tickets so they can bail your ass out of them. I say fuck that, so let’s discuss the top myths.</p><p>The first popular myth I hear is that red cars are pulled over more often. This is patently false; if you drive fast enough all red cars will eventually appear blue to a distant observer, and by that point it is impossible for the 5-0 to catch you. It’s just physics, assholes.</p><p>I have also heard in my travels that police officers physically cannot see base-model Hyundai products. This is also false: in fact, the presence of Hyundais gives cops a pleasant soporific effect, to the extent that in the wild, police officers have been witnessed curling up to a test Hyundai Pony inserted in their environment by researchers in order to have a quick nap. Besides, nobody wants to go to the courthouse and try to explain that they got a ticket for a hundred over in a playground zone in an Elantra.</p><p>We are running out of time now, as I see the organizer of these very Talks pointing at his Apple Watch and telling me to get off the stage so that some guy named Damian can tell us about how mountain climbing taught him that it’s a bad idea to enslave minorities in work camps. Please hit me up after the talks if you want to ask some more questions, but be aware that the mud-terrain-clad 1954 Bel-Air Tradesman parked in the cafeteria is going to leave pretty shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>“Are you <i>unhappy</i>?” asks the onboard psychiatrist wedged crudely into the dashboard of my C3 Corvette. I sighed, and tried to ignore it. Ever since the government had decided that being angry or sad in traffic was a primary cause of accidents, they decided to chase after it by mandating that we all install artificial-intelligence psychiatrists in our shitboxes.</p><p>The upshot is that you always had someone to talk to on long road trips, but the downside was that almost nobody liked to be psychoanalyzed while waiting at a stop light. Usually, I was pretty good at controlling my galvanic skin response, the percentage of moisture in my breath, and at keeping my curse words to myself. Sometimes, like today, it wasn’t nearly enough.</p><p>“Maybe you should try telling me about your <i>childhood</i>,” chirped the federally-mandated safety device. I continue to make my best effort to pay no attention to it, turning up the stereo as loud as I feel the creaking paper-cone speakers can muster.</p><p>I was just about to snap and punch out the robot, federal law be damned, when a bicyclist rode alongside me in the bike lane. The in-dash psychiatrist suddenly became quiet.</p><p>The bicyclist looked left, looked right, then rode through the red light.<br/></p><p>“PEDESTRIAN OR VEHICLE, PICK ONE, MOTHER<i>FUCKER</i>,” screamed the single-DIN shrink, loudly enough to crack my dash pad. As it continued to wail in inarticulate rage, I noticed a faint red glow appearing from behind its module. At last, I smelled the scent of lifting solder, and the unit sharply went silent.</p><p>The next day, the friendly agents from the government visited me at home. Shaking their heads, they extracted the destroyed psychiatrist from my dashboard before glumly placing it into a glossy black trash bag.</p><p>“Some things are just impossible to keep from being angry at,” the senior agent explained to me, barely holding back tears at the loss of one more brave soldier of road safety.<br/></p>

<p>Sometimes when I get really bored I like to go down to the local dealership and pretend to be a salesman. It’s not all that hard; there’s always a pile of spare shirts in the back, and you can say whatever the fuck you want about anything because nobody expects a salesman to know what he is talking about.</p><p>Today, my victims are a young couple, fresh out of college, looking to get their first car together. They have a massive dog, they tell me, and for a few minutes we are scrolling together through their collective phone camera backlog in search of pictorial evidence of the dog’s existence. I have the perfect car for them, I tell them, and lead them out into the parking lot, where the wheezing Tercel I have driven to the dealership leaks its lifeblood into the cracked tarmac.</p><p>“Look at this motherfucker,” I tell them. “Quad turbos. You can drive to the moon and back on a thimble full of gas. The suspension cures kidney cancer, I shit you not. Ferry Porsche once tried to stab me for the secrets behind the air conditioning, which doesn’t work because it’s terrible for the environment.”<br/></p><p>The male of the couple has decided that he wants to negotiate with me, because he has identified through exposure to mass media that car salesmen are always willing to negotiate. He says he wants $1000 off. I tell him I’ll talk to my manager.</p><p>Five minutes later, I return from taking a piss on the manager’s parked-across-two-spots Jaguar to shake their hands. Congratulations, I tell them, you won’t regret this, and ask if their twenty grand will come in the form of a cheque or a money order.</p><p>A month later, when I am appointed Salesman of the Year to the complete confusion of the existing sales staff, the dealership principal asks me how I did it. The secret is <i>confidence</i>, I tell him. By the way, you look like a man who could use a new car. I have the perfect car for you, it’s just out front here.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be an esteemed anthropologist to understand that there are vibrant currents of social movement happening every day in your friendly neighbourhood junkyard. Indeed, just one trip to the dilapidated taco truck parked in one corner of the lot so very long ago will show you the various kinds of people that make their daily bread pulling the old car that you gave a name to and then unceremoniously killed because of something so minor as a coolant leak or a four-car pileup.</p><p>My quest was to get to the top of the heap, socially. I wanted to be a <i>regular</i>, and have the other denizens recognize me by name. It’s hard to say exactly why I wanted to do this, but it probably had something to do with the fact that it was pretty easy. You see, climbing the social ladder at the junkyard is a two-part project: first, you have to show up to the junkyard. Second, you have to do it in the coolest fucking car in the parking lot.</p><p>Now, you’d think that wouldn’t be hard. Everyone else has beaters, right? I’ll just show up in a new luxury car, like I do at my job on Wall Street. Wrong, so very wrong. Anyone can buy a BMW, but only the Junkyard King could keep, for example, a propane-fuelled turbo-swapped Plymouth Reliant teetering on just this edge of the abyss long enough to fill its trunk with his daily bounty of floormats and barely-worn brake pads.</p><p>No, what I needed was the <i>ultimate beater</i>, something so rare as to cause disbelief, and so weird that it would force stories from the lips of those who would witness it, during late-night garage-time bullshitting sessions. “This motherfucker at the junkyard brought in a twin-turbocharged Detroit-swapped ‘74 Maserati Quattroporte with a tube-frame pickup bed riding on 33 inch mud terrains,” I imagined they would say to one another, gasping at the very concept of how god damn cool I was.</p><p>I went looking on Kijiji, and I found my cool ride. I was all over its supple curves, its quirky interior, its barely-restrained animalistic fury. Also it was the first thing on the list under a grand.</p><p>“Holy shit, does that thing still have the built-in picnic table?” the Junkyard King asked me the next morning, unable to believe that someone could have a 1998 Honda CR-V in <i>manual</i>.<br/></p>

<p>My two idiot sons come barging into the Oval Office, screaming something completely indecipherable about climate change or polluting smallblocks or the abstract concept of life after death. I dismissed them, as I generally did, with a lazy overhead toss of my desktop letter opener in their direction, burying the gleaming blade up to the hilt in the collarbone of the one I think I called Little Frank.</p><p>I summon my military advisor, because I have heard something extremely troubling somewhere in their pathetic babble. Plugging my left ear with my index finger, I fire my Luger directly into the ceiling, disgorging plaster in our agreed-upon distress signal. You can try to ignore an inter-office intercom, I tell them in my internationally-recognized book of How To Succeed In Business, but you can’t ignore a hot nine-millimeter hollow point.</p><p>He gets the news, and before long he has already kicked both Little Frank and the other one of my sons out of the way in his harried rush to my office. His gin-swollen face flaps in a crude imitation of a dying fish as he asks me what it is I need.</p><p>“I’ve heard of the <i>Paris Accords</i>,” I tell him, banging the desk with my commemorative Presidential brass knuckles. “Are they wagons? If they are, I want to authorize a first strike to free those wagons.”<br/></p>

<H1>Capsule History of the Ford Taurus, Part 1</H1>
<p>The Ford Taurus, also known in the Mexican market as El Fordo De Taurusino, is one of Middle America’s most beloved brands. Did you ever wonder how the Ford Taurus came to be?</p><p>No, of course not, I hear you saying, normal people don’t want to hear about the Ford Taurus. You’re <i>not </i>a normal person, I tell you, that’s why I’m here to help, and my hand imperceptibly slips into my pocket as we converse. With a flash of my closed fist, I have forced a near-knockout dose of Haldol into your mouth and our session can at last begin.</p><p>The original inventor of the Ford Taurus is Robert McNamara, most famous for the Vietnam War. However, when he still worked at Ford back in the 50s, he drew some pictures of a totally bitchin’ robot that shot people in the dick but was also a police officer. Those simple sketches later became Robocop, a titan of Hollywood immortalized on the silver screen by Wisconsin’s own Peter Weller.</p><p>Robocop needed a bitchin’ ride, and Ford also needed a front-wheel-drive import fighter with which to finally respond to the nearly-unbroken twenty year span in which a chuckling Soichiro Honda himself had his polished wingtips on their collective throats. After a weekend of furious sketching, and an unprecedented fifteen minutes of testing, the first-generation Ford Taurus was released to a shrieking, terrified crowd of onlookers at the Detroit Motor Show in 1985. Later, Ford executives would comment that they wished they had done a more conventional unveiling rather than trying to barrel through the crowded convention hall doing nearly 80 mph to show off the Taurus’ best-in-some-class handling.</p><p>After some good-natured ribbing from Chrysler executives, who were at the time turning their dopey economy cars into three-hundred-wheel-horsepower turbocharged nightmare rockets ripped from Carroll Shelby’s most secret sexual fantasies, Ford decided to do what they should have done in the first place and had the Japanese build their fucking motors. The result was an unprecedented-for-North-America <i>overhead camshaft</i> engine, previously only seen in luxury exotics such as the mid-spec 1980 Ford Escort.</p><p>Ford was so excited about this new development, known internally as the “Taurus Holy Shit,” that they decided to take the development car into production, unveiling it again at the Detroit Motor Show by using a test vehicle to jump four school buses for stunned onlookers. Car and Driver Magazine at the time called the stunt “unnerving,” and presumed that the newly-renamed Taurus SHO must have been a creation of European Satan (pronounced <i>Satané </i>in the original French).</p><p>Eventually, Ford executives got bored, and forgot that they made the Taurus. Without an executive to micromanage the factories, the workers at the Taurus production plants simply wandered away, distracted by butterflies and the chirping meadows around their sites of work.</p><p>It wasn’t until late 2008 that Bill Ford woke up from the cryogenic slumber he had placed himself in during the Dealer Incentive Wars of 1993. His first directive was to revive the beleaguered Taurus brand, a decision that anthropologists and economists agree may have precipitated an unprecedented worldwide economic collapse.</p><p>In part two of this series, we’ll discuss the formation of the Taurus’ evil twin, the Mercury Sable, and the true motivations behind the team of teenagers with mystical powers who joined forces to destroy it.</p>

<p>I gotta tell you, being a maverick beekeeper is hard enough without these damn kids racing their Wankel rotaries through here and luring away my finest insects. My day had barely started when I had to exchange gunfire with a set of big-business Hive Mafia types angered that I had lifted a few pounds of honeycomb to which they weren’t paying very much attention.</p><p>Once I had finished pollinating their goons with my usual assortment of hot lead, I was at last ready to get down to the serious business. I had started doing this all these years ago for the love of these bees, the charm of their buzzing antics, the smell and sight of fresh honey and innocent larvae taking their first smells of the world. That’s when I heard it.</p><p>A bridgeported RX-7 came ripping down the street, its exhaust note sounding like a swarm of the toughest bees imaginable. Of course, the hive I had just fought so hard to protect erupted into a defensive swarm, stinging me repeatedly. I didn’t mind, because the real pain would come later, when it became obvious that my newly ill-gotten hive had been voided of its valuable workers. It was virtually worthless.</p><p>Sure, this had happened to me before, but I figured the general loss of RX-7s in the world borne of rot, oil consumption and side seal delaminating would make my job easier. I had not counted on those who would rebuild those engines, make them even louder and more irritating as part of the meticulous rebuild process.</p><p>“Save the thirteen bees,” they said to one another when I would spy on them at their meets. What about <i>my</i> bees, I shrieked into my Honey Nut Cheerios commemorative coffee mug full of mead?<br/></p>

<p>I didn’t follow any particular brand or organization out of loyalty; I did it because that’s where the <i>deals</i> lived. The fact that my own idea of ‘deals’ involved pancake motors which burned gallons of oil and then exploded, supernova-esque, in a hyperheated mist of death coolant and Clevite provided me no small amount of cognitive dissonance.</p><p>When I found out about the Saabarus available in my very own neighbourhood, I rejoiced: at last, a chance to learn new tidbits about Subarus with which to annoy my wrenching companions. The cherry on top was the pretense of luxury that was only formerly accessible to drug dealers and other low-end entrepreneurs on the other side of the tracks. With this car, I was sure, I would have it all: a new black hole with which to consume my spare Impreza parts collection, and legitimacy in the greater society which had heretofore rejected me.</p><p>I was feeling pretty successful - I had even put on a <i>shirt</i> that morning - so it came as quite a surprise when the 5-0 rumbled me for one of my smaller automotive sins. Perhaps the Saab was more distinctive than my usual claptrap automobiles, or maybe it was because there was no longer a dense cloud of oil vapour obscuring my presence until I was safely out of the officer’s visual range. Either way, I now had Johnny Law to deal with.</p><p>Before I could even complete rolling down the window, the cop had opened his mouth and stuck it into the cabin of the car.</p><p>“What’s going on with this molar, doc? It’s buggin’ the hell out of me,” I think he said through his yawning maw.<br/></p><p>I couldn’t very well tell him I wasn’t a dentist lest he suspect me of grand theft auto, so I did the best I could doing a root canal with what I had left in the trunk. Luckily, I never went anywhere without my trusty Dremel and tubes of black RTV. It was basically like patching rust, but the rust was in the mouth of a police officer who wouldn’t stop asking me for a hit of nitrous from the tank in the back.</p>

<p>Every government agency was throwing a lot of shit at the wall in those days, trying to figure out what would awaken the interest of those who held the budget pursestrings long enough for them to shake free a few coins. My humble position at the EPA was no different, but I was never what they call a “team player.”</p><p>As such, when my boss came barrelling through the meeting room that Tuesday morning, imploring us to “brainstorm some crazy ideas,” I said the dumbest ones I could think of. Unfortunately, it’s always the dumbest ideas that seem to catch fire.</p><p>Within weeks, we were building and testing prototypes in the lab. This innovation would revolutionize fuel economy, reducing the average American’s spend on gasoline by almost a thousand dollars a year. We knew that the big oil companies would come after us, but we all figured the trained teams of ex-Soviet assassins would plug our boss first, give us a little warning to hop on a plane to Portugal.</p><p>Even so, with only a little maiming, my boss survived to demo our innovation for Good Morning America. The problem was simple, he said: dogs sticking their heads out the window of moving cars created a small but perceptible amount of drag. We would place an aerodynamic Lexan bubble over the open window of the car, redirecting airflow past the relatively inefficient shape of the dog’s head and providing extra downforce.</p><p>Sure, I got a medal from Congress and all, but I still think about the sad look on the face of the first dog in our test program who realized that the wind wasn’t blowing in his face anymore.</p>

<p>All men die. Not all men truly live. I reflect on this truism as Taro Aso, age 7, shatters my tibia in three places with the foam-rubber bumper of the simulated police car.</p><p>For my crimes of smuggling torque into the Home Islands, I have been condemned to a sentence of court-ordered community service. Today, my job is to work in a public park, educating schoolchildren about the impending responsibilities society will place upon them as part of learning to operate a motor vehicle. Most of the kids are dull sparks, afraid to really open up the gas, but not little Taro. Motherfucker <i>loves</i> full throttle.</p><p>For some reason, the friendly police officer at the other end of the park keeps letting him take repeated rides, while gesturing at me to get back into my spot and prepare to walk out in front of him, playing an oblivious pedestrian trying to tweet on his phone. I don’t even have a phone, I tried to explain to this Inspector Koshiro during our federally-mandated bento box break, but he just menacingly waved his nightstick in my direction and reminded me that he once had to use force on a criminal, which made him the toughest cop in Japan.</p><p>Every time I step into oncoming traffic, I have been bracing myself for the impact. I am pretty sure it is actually just making things worse, so I try relaxing and “rolling with the punches,’ like I saw on a flower-arrangement TV show once late at night. This is when the replica police car finally ruptures my leg under me.</p><p>Koshiro laughs as he hears my shinbone dimple under yet another of Taro’s high-speed assaults. I am pretty sure he has been giving him tips on how to carry more speed through the other side of the figure-eight test track. It’s probably unnecessary. Even the dumbest kids we’ve had through here could see the best turn-in point is just past the fibreglass cartoon rabbit eternally watering its lawn, and they aren’t hitting me with anywhere near the same level of calf-splintering force. This kid has something special, and the good Inspector agrees.</p><p>“Excellent job, Taro! You will be Japan’s finest F1 driver yet! Even better than Taki Inoue!” he cries, patriotic pride finally having overcome his pretense of concern for public safety.<br/></p>

<p>“These are the Red Tag Days spoken of in myth,” I plead with the Lord Regent. “We must immediately send an army to the distant lands before the promised era of Toyotathon dawns upon us.”<br/></p><p>He looks at me, narrowing his eyes as he considers my words carefully. Then he speaks.</p><p>“You wizards and witches come to this hold often, and you speak of Toyota deals which are unbelievable to the human mind. Incomprehensible. But I understand these deals,” he says dismissively, while pouring another flagon of mead. “They are the deals of <i>men</i>.”<br/></p><p>Standing, he faces the narrow keyhole window in his room. “We cannot afford to further subsidize Ford dealer floorplan. The Escapes will have to sell themselves with only ten grand on the hood.”</p><p>A fortnight later, Toyotathon unfurled its dark cloak over the Realm of Depreciation. At the head of their immense marching army stood the Toyota Highlander, yet something was different.</p><p>“Mother<i>fucker</i>, they made a hybrid Highlander?” the Lord Regent cursed, immediately before being struck down by superior initial quality.<br/></p>

<p>Article 19 of the Constitution of Japan explicitly forbids the possession of undersquare engines for any purpose, including national self defense. Those who commit acts of high-torque treason against the government are secreted away to black sites, never to be heard from again.</p><p>Last week, we were hanging out with this guy from the shop, Junpei. We liked him. He liked us. I think our bombastic North American attitudes and general lack of concern for safety regulations rubbed off on him. Next thing we heard, the federales kicked in the door to his apartment, found him fabricating a turbo manifold for a 4.3 V6 on his kitchen table. Off to the gulag, just like that.</p><p>I didn’t really mind it so much. I would help myself to their scraps, pick up free intercooler cores, silicone hose, those nice little stainless t-bolt clamps. All I had to do was pull down the police tape. The cops would never arrest me; I would just play dumb, pretend I didn’t know their language, act like a barbarian who comes from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law. They’d smile and sometimes even help me carry the illicit contraband to my Minica ZZ at the curb.</p><p>What I was truly afraid of was the threat of being deported back to North America, where I would at last face trial for my crime of operating a vehicle with an engine displacement below two liters.</p>

<p>For years, I would be flummoxed on my commute by witnessing a man in a front end loader going the other way. At first, I thought it was just another roadworks or parks project, a construction team moving equipment during rush hour. After a few months, and especially after a few years, I realized that no construction project would be going on this long, nor would this guy have to make the drive every single morning.</p><p>At last I could take it no longer, and yanked the hydraulic handbrake on my Valiant. Before the carbon-fibre replica panels could even finish their rattling after the curb hop, I had caught up with the loader. Soon, I had followed him to an ordinary office-complex parking lot. That’s strange, I thought, this doesn’t look like it needed construction. Or even landscaping.</p><p>The driver jumped out, a man about my height wearing a dress shirt and slacks. He left the hardhat and reflective safety vest on the seat. I decided to interrogate him, to finally understand the rationale behind this strange sight.</p><p>“You got me. I’m not really a construction worker,” he said, frowning, “I’m what they like to call a ‘workie.’ We dress up like construction workers and commute to our boring office jobs in heavy equipment, so we can at least pretend we’re putting in an honest day’s work. It’s what I always wanted to do since I was a child.”<br/></p><p>I was confused, and found myself getting defensive about my own choices in life. Sure, I dressed up like a race car driver and daily-drove a fire-breathing twin-turbocharged fifty year old economy car, but that wasn’t because I craved excitement in between <i>my</i> visits to the workplace. Wasn’t it?</p><p>I turned to say something, but he was gone. He had booped the security card sensor, entered his office and prepared to participate in a daily standup. The cold wind howled past me, standing in the middle of a dreary parking lot.</p><p>Back in the Valiant, I could not control my thoughts. Perhaps his way of life was more correct than mine, and that I was being dishonest to my true nature. There was no way I could ever live up to my childhood dreams like he had, though. I asked myself, what would Dr. Oz say?</p><p>The next week, I was happily driving a replica Moon Rover to work. Sure, there were some problems keeping it in wire-mesh tires and the visor on my helmet kept fogging up even with a heavy dose of Rain-X, but it was all worth it for the angry honks that my fellow motorists would give me, out of jealousy as much as being frustrated at my top speed of 48 kilometers per hour.</p>

<p>It’s your Eye In The Sky for Action News Five. There’s some congestion at Sixth and Main that appears to be some kind of station wagon that’s on fire. No, wait, he’s just doing an immense burnout.</p><p>I’ve been to war zones, been mustard-gassed by an acid-mad half-blind mercenary who was born in the jungle and fought like hell to maintain his way of life, and I’ve still never seen a one-tire-fire this impressive.</p><p>I can see the police arriving now. They, too, are just men. Impressed men. They have lowered their weapons, one officer even dropping to one knee, bowing out of respect to the impending death of the Goodyears throwing the last of their marbles into this morning’s crisp autumn air.</p><p>We had such hubris, to think that man could fly this high, to put himself above the hustle and bustle of the city. I used to believe myself superior, that I had escaped or even could flee my past. Well, dear viewers, I was wrong. This man, this tire-bashing devil who is at this very moment marking his territory across the dimpled and fractured tarmac of the intersection, has unmade me.</p><p>The Action News Chopper pilot, who I have never learned the name of, is piloting us closer to get a better look at this incredible smoke cloud.  Yes, the tire smoke blacker than the night sky, the fog of rubber a beautiful vortex that compels the mind further inwards to an inescapable trap for consciousness, I cannot escape it. Only here can I receive ultimate redemption, baptized anew in the smoke screen of one fucking sweet burnout. Tell my wife I love her.</p>

<p>I worked the crusher back then, feeding dozens of shitboxes into its maw. At first, I had resolved that I would not be the guy who blindly crushes cars. This is my confession, though I know in my heart I am beyond any absolution it could bring.</p><p>For every quirky car, I pledged, two Cavaliers would meet their maker, keep my boss off my back. Maybe they’d live long enough to let someone save them, or just pull that one part they couldn’t find anywhere else, keep another one alive somewhere out there. What would happen when the world ran out of Cavaliers? I tried not to think about that.<br/></p><p>

Don’t let us get crushed, they pleaded even as I fed them myself into the crusher, my eyes shut so tightly they hurt, although the tears would still flow past the lids.

<br/></p><p>One day, there were no more Cavaliers. I was distraught. On the way in, I had read a newspaper article stating that in fact no automaker had produced a “bad” car in almost a decade. Whatever was I supposed to do in order to save the real gems? My panic over potentially crushing a worthwhile automobile by mistake came to an abrupt end when I frantically searched the to-crush list for that morning and came across my first doomed Nissan Altima Coupe.</p><p>That afternoon, I received a promotion. They said I had developed a “good attitude” about the whole thing, that I seemed for the first time in years to truly enjoy my work and attend to it with zeal.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe it. After years of letter-writing, grassroots campaigns and race riots, <i>Tokyo Drift</i> was finally being admitted into the Hollywood Hall of Fame as one of the finest films ever made. The Academy sent me a gold-fringed letter and everything about it, and it was real classy the way the letter transitioned into their plea for me to live up to my side of the deal and release all those hostages.</p><p>Thing was, the same letter apologized for not having a section for “best on-screen cross-marque engine swap,” which I felt was a total abomination. Didn’t they understand it was a metaphor for how the protagonist had learned to balance his new surroundings with his innate nature? Also that it made stupid levels of boost?</p><p>Sure, Big Hollywood would win this one. But I’d be back to put my star on their Walk of Fame. Months later, I would be arrested trying to do a four-alarm burnout, leaving the tread surface of a pair of corded General Grabbers across the sidewalk. Hollywood controlled the government, of course, and it should have been no surprise that they would use force to coerce defenders of the truth like myself into prison.</p>

<p>It was times like this that I remembered my mentor’s wise words: “the Cutlass Ciera is a pretty fine ride.&ldquo; He was right, though the front-drive bull that I was now trying to rope bore only a legal resemblance to its as-delivered form. I blipped the throttle and watched the carbon-fibre front clam quiver with anger above the twin-turbocharged sixty-degree vee-six.</p><p>Sure, it had started innocently enough. They all do. I had seen it growing moss and gathering rust in the corner of a yard, inquired within, and rescued the beast only to find out that it had more problems than I had figured. It went into the corner of <i>my</i> yard immediately afterward, only to be the first car I had spotted after I got that big settlement cheque from the Dremel people for making their cutting discs excessively fragile so they could sell a few more.</p><p>Now, as I roamed the streets in a quad-digit-horsepower nightmare machine freed from the death row of obsolescence and commanded to kill again, I wondered if perhaps I was missing the point of my mentor’s worship of the econobox as-delivered. Perhaps what my mentor considered “fine” was in fact the opportunity to drive past a daycare without feeling like you were twirling a loaded assault rifle by its hair trigger out the sunroof.</p><p>My thoughts wandering allowed the Ciera to get the better of me, and I banished such heresy from my mind in order to rope the front end back under control as it torque-steered across four lanes in a haze of rubber and nitromethane smoke.</p>

<p>It can be a struggle for today’s young professionals to pick an automobile that promotes their personal ‘brand’ to the world. Here with us today is noted automotive journalist, P. G. Switch. Mr. Switch, it’s a pleasure to have you here. What can you tell us about the kind of car a twenty-something up-and-coming mover-and/or-shaker should be driving?</p><p>Well, it’s important off the bat to understand that literally no normal person cares what kind of car you drive. That’s why I drive a red 1991 Toyota Celica with rust holes in it the size of an adult Papillon, then tell people it’s a rare 1967 Ferrari Misfortuna. They eat that shit up, and then I get invited onto morning news programs to talk about cars.</p><p>That’s, uh, great, Mr. Switch. Can you show us what you have brought with you to the show today?</p><p>Yes, as you can see here, your Trouble Shooters segment has managed to track down the guy who screwed me over on a turbo with “no shaft play” last weekend. I’ve placed these attractive rusty meathooks directly through his chest muscles and are providing him with a twelve thousand volt shock every so often. I wouldn’t get too close.</p>

<p>Nobody could save me from Saab. Wherever I looked, I would find sub-$500 GM-Swedish abominations pulling at my purse strings. Help us, the cars said, we’re weird.</p><p>Driving down the street, I would spot a minty 9-5 wagon up on blocks with its turbocharger blown or interior ripped. Some part of me would wonder if maybe I <i>did</i> have what it could take to rescue it, make a plea deal with the owner before the tow truck came to pick it up for its date with the crusher. The old suburbanite impulses would resurface after a short time, tell me that I didn’t have enough storage or enough free time to save this one, and wasn’t I already hip deep in bullshit projects with hard-to-get parts already?</p><p>I fled to the mountains. There, I felt, people were more normal. They would have old pickup trucks, domestic economy cars, nothing weird and Swedish. It just wouldn’t happen. As I climbed further and further away from urban society, I felt the influence of Trollhattan upon my mental state wane. Plus, the roads were pretty good up there. Lots of corners.</p><p>They said that decades ago, a group of old rally fans had barricaded themselves up here, unwilling to believe that Group B had ended. My daily-driver Subaru was just old enough to convince them that I was part of their clique, and so when I finally put together the clues that afternoon, the rally fans allowed me through the gate, barking their ceremonial “OI OI OI OI” at my approach.</p><p>I stepped out of the car, confident now that perhaps I had finally found my people with which to wait out the last of the Saabs.</p><p>There was no way I would ever pay five hundred dollars for a Saab, I said even as my wallet was opened and two thousand dollars was removed for the rusty shell of a barely-running 1978 Saab 99 Turbo.</p><p>After all, there was no way to find parts for an older car whose manufacturer had died, I explained as they lowered the front-cut of a 96, replete with furious two-stroke three, into the capacious hatch “for later.”</p><p>I’d have to hang out with a bunch of weird people, I had trouble saying through my helmet to my panicking codriver as I took the Swedish shitbox fully sideways across their back-forty rallycross course.</p><p>Then it was all just sort of a blur.</p><p>Help me, I plead to the customers of the Greyhound station as they tried to avert their eyes from my homeless visage, I’m weird.</p>

<p>We were all really to blame for the twin-turbocharged John Deere that had gained sentience and began patrolling the city, looking for ungroomed lawns.</p><p>When it first got free, the Mayor was super angry. How dare we let a semi-autonomous bag of spinning knives loose on the playground near us? When would it stop, he asked, before realizing that the Deere was busily mowing the front lawn of City Hall and doing a pretty good job of it. Then he started to compliment us, speaking loudly over my explanation that we hadn’t really finalized the child-detection code yet before it figured out how to drive through my garage door and escape.</p><p>

 To tell you the truth, though, we had a lot of free time now, at least until it ran out of gas and held up another liquor store for a forty of Pennzoil and unfiltered low-ethanol 91 octane. The Mayor was happy because he got to take the tax money that would otherwise be spent on lawns and sock it away under his pillow, which was on a yacht moored in the Caymans.<br/></p><p>What none of us could expect was that one day the lawnmower would run for office itself, trading on the well-known Deere family name to boost its name recognition among decided and undecided voters alike. Its campaign of low taxes and cheap high-octane, low-ethanol fuels resonated with those same voters as it made promises it could not keep, and shredded tax bills with great ceremony upon the wood-and-astroturf stage of its press announcements.</p><p>I rushed to the Mayor’s office in those awful last days of his reign, helped him feed paperwork into the shredder. What we hadn’t known before the explosive leaks to the media was that the shredder was a distinctly pro-blades kind of guy.</p>

<p>Recently we had a little bit of a humdinger down here at the ol’ Switch HQ. You might have heard about it in the news, and although none of the allegations have yet been proven in a court of law, we decided to make a best effort at remedying them. I asked myself, what kind of community service do people consider essential? Then I just decided it was firetrucks.</p><p>Now, you might think that a volunteer fire department is relatively unnecessary in a city such as this, which already has a well-equipped <i>professional</i> fire department. Certainly I had my detractors around the office, but they almost all shut up when I showed them the firetruck I decided to buy.</p><p>Imported from Japan, my right-hand-drive Mitsubishi Fuso shortcab firetruck let me rip through the streets, its taut suspension and firm-shifting five speed manual transmission keeping the miniature turbocharger on boil. Sure, there were wrinkles, like the fact that fire radio is encrypted so I had no real idea where the houses that were on fire were actually <i>located</i>, but I made an effort and that’s what counted.</p><p>One morning, I was doing pulls on the highway, trying to shake out the fuel map to eke out a few more horsepower. That’s when I saw it - smoke that didn’t seem to be coming from my miniature diesel. On the side of the road, a car was fully engulfed in flames, and its driver was busy trying to flag me down, probably confusing me for one of the <i>sell-out</i> fire trucks.</p><p>Once I pulled in behind the flaming Ferrari 458, the driver was overjoyed. What luck, they yelled at me, while I put out their car. Frowning, I told them that I was going to have to seize the engine for evidence, in order to understand its propensity for combustion, namely around the rev-limiter area.</p><p>Weeks later, I was no longer very concerned about diesel tuning, and I didn’t really need a siren either. It probably still would have been a good idea to put on a muffler, because I sure didn’t hear those cops behind me.</p>

<p>By the year 2020, we expect all self-driving cars to be capable of doing the entire grocery run for you. At last, man’s greatest waste of time will be defeated forever. I work on the team that’s making it possible. We assembled in one place the greatest minds of Silicon Valley, and told them to write a bunch of Javascript that would make an autonomous car capable of telling peameal bacon apart from regular bacon.</p><p>Sure, the early prototypes didn’t exactly work out, but once we figured out that the car never had to go <i>into</i> the grocery store, our jobs got a lot simpler. After all, almost no products in the Lexus stable could fit in today’s ever-tighter produce aisles. We got a few more months of runway too, because all the liability lawsuits started to go away for some reason.</p><p>It wasn’t until our demo Mercury Milan (painted Ebony Metallic, of course, the racists) got arrested in the bad part of town that we realized it had other, more valuable alternative products it could pick up. Upon hearing this, our captive investors were overjoyed, pulling futilely at the welded-shut latches of their wrist-chained briefcases in a vain attempt to extract term sheets and Series A funding paperwork. They were invigorated, and we decided to strike while the iron was hot. But we needed to get some of that <i>supply side</i>, said my mentor.</p><p>Weeks later, we were trillionaires, but I still had to go to the grocery store myself, on foot, like an ape. It just wasn’t profitable to have your car doing anything other than trafficking thousands of pounds of high-value narcotics per day, our internal economists explained to us. The opportunity cost was simply too high.</p>

<p>Recently, my enemies - and I have many - have attempted to smear me in the press. Striking from a position of relative anonymity, they choose to paint me as a complete lunatic who is obsessed with tall redlines and doing burnouts in church parking lots. Nothing could be further from the truth, and that is why I am so grateful that the New York Times has offered me some editorial space in order to refute these allegations.</p><p>One of the most troubling allegations I read in yesterday’s full-page ad was that I am consumed by an urge to accelerate. This is simply untrue: in today’s modern cities, let alone the laws of thermodynamics themselves, continuing to accelerate without limit is simply impossible.</p><p>I choose instead to maintain my <i>average</i> speed by taking advantage of under-used urban infrastructure such as subway tunnels, sidewalks and front lawns. After all, my tax money paid for roads, and it also paid for these things, so they are both legally and morally equivalent.</p><p>

The old story that I once hijacked a school bus in order to steal its Detroit? Also false. It was a Navistar, not like I want to admit to that.

<br/></p><p>Many of my political opponents have also commented on my unusual predilection towards Italian cars. Those of you out there who would be concerned about such things should be reassured that I only love Italian cars from a great distance. There is absolutely no cause for alarm, and those photographs that have circulated are no doubt fake. Also that GTV6 was asking for it, wearing a splitter that big.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">And above all, the American public must know this: while the Russians </span><i style="font-size: 14px;">did</i><span style="font-size: 14px;"> try to bribe me in order to give up the nuclear launch codes, the Lada Niva they offered me had a worn out clutch and I’m not fucking replacing that.</span><br/></p>

<p>There’s been a lot of talk in the media about the future of our children as it pertains to science and technology. Lots of talk, not much action. I decided that I would take things into my own hands and volunteer to help out at the local soap box derby being put on by the Scouts. I would teach those kids the lessons and the pitfalls I had encountered throughout my life, and show them the path to do better.</p><p>“Kids,” I said, gesturing to my guest once the dust had settled. “This is my friend from NASA, gravity well expert Dr. Juliet “Psycho” Carter. She’s on supervised day release for good behaviour, but she deactivated her tracking bracelet and left her floor manager unconscious in the bathroom of the Denny’s just off I-5.”<br/></p><p>Dr. Carter smiled at the kids, and a few of them involuntarily shut their eyes, not wanting to see what she had seen. Others smiled back. Those would be the ones who would go the fastest today, I had decided. They were not afraid of death. They were not afraid of <i>speed</i>.</p><p>Ted Armistice, one of the volunteer dads in the paddock behind me, clucked at some wheel bearings, lifting the hub cassette to his face and rotating it slowly in an effort for it to tell him of the truths of the universe. He would never want to get his wish, and I had someone right here who could tell him why.</p><p>“Have any of you kids been to the inside of a black hole?” I continued. “The Doc has, and she came back a changed woman. Don’t get too close to her hands.”</p><p>That afternoon, we won the race. After we put out the fire and pulled the test driver from what was left the car, we went out for some ice cream. Let’s see the Chinese top that, I said while two-fisting a bottle of Lactaid pills.</p>

<p>After my Uncle Pennybags died and left me the deed to his garage condo, I figured I would head on down and try my luck at fixing the ol’ daily driver. Surely, I reasoned, even the bougiest assholes around would smile when they saw a 1989 Geo Prizm shooting antilag fireballs across the floor from its fender-exit exhaust.</p><p>By the day’s end, I figured that I’d be getting invited to golf courses, and I might even be able to stop tinkering with that golf cart long enough to get one of those vaunted management jobs I’d heard so much about. You know the jobs I’m referring to: the ones with the free cocaine and the Aston Martin company cars that can be sold to pay for used Ford Escort GTs.</p><p>I showed up, and pulled my toolkit from the hatch. After a few minutes of swearing at a heat-seized intercooler T-bolt clamp, I was interrupted by a knock at the door. It was a rich person, and he was wondering what I was doing.</p><p>“Working on my car,” I told him, confused. Wasn’t that what a garage condo was for?<br/></p><p>“Oh no, <i>no</i>,” he told me. “You work on your car with one of these” - he holds up a microfiber chamois with quick-detailer spray on it - “You’ll just scratch your maid’s car if you use that to clean it.”<br/></p>

<p>A lot of people take their cars for granted. Not me, my court-ordered psychiatrist says: I am <i>way</i> too in to this shit. I can become totally consumed by repeatedly clicking the the amazing pop-out cupholder of a junkyard Jaguar open and closed. Look at it go, I say to the undelighted onlookers who pass by. Even taking the language barrier into consideration, I still feel that they are snubbing me unduly.</p><p>What’s more, today’s modern car is packed jam-full of a dizzying number of new innovations. Just the other day I was at the new car dealership, and before the yard dogs were able to reach me, I found that new Ford Fusions are outfitted with a jack, lug wrench and <i>owner’s manual</i>.</p><p>Having owned only used cars that were formerly operated by wanted felons who apparently spent their copious free time driving through liquid sewage, this last bit was extremely fascinating to me. I decided then and there that I would begin a brutal campaign to write a user’s manual for my daily driver, so that I no longer had to spend fifteen minutes explaining its various quirks to my friends when they needed to borrow it.</p><p>Here is just one excerpt from my great work, <i>Your Guide To Operating The 1988 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series (Customized by Switch’s Rides)</i></p><p><b>Headlights</b></p><p>Don’t have ‘em, you probably don’t need them. Don’t pull the high beam switch (pictured right) or something really bad will happen.</p><p><b>Starting the Car</b></p><p>If you can avoid doing it, put it off as long as possible. Quickly insert the key, but not all the way, pull it out a little bit and wiggle it a bit until you feel the switch clicking inside. Keep pulling it back and wiggling it until the ignition switch engages, then hold the key tight against the steering column so it doesn’t fall out with your right knee until the car starts.</p><p>Don’t let the car idle for more than five minutes. It will start trying to ingest the coolant left in the cylinders from the previous night and hydrolock. Strongly suggest that you attempt to hit the speed limit as soon as possible so that you can force enough air down the intake to push the coolant past what’s left of the rings.</p><p><b>Parking the Car</b></p><p>Make sure to disconnect the battery or the dome light will eat it. Even though the dome light always appears off, it is in fact always on. Do not attempt to service the dome light, I’ll get around to it someday.</p><p><b>Activating Cruise Control</b></p><p>Cruise control activation is automatic. To deactivate cruise control, reach under the dashboard and wiggle the throttle cable loose from the bracket it keeps getting hung up on.</p><p><b>Safety</b></p><p>Don’t read this manual while driving.</p><p><b>Shifting Gears</b></p><p>The Town Car’s advanced automatic transmission is equipped with a computer based on fuzzy logic which the transmission completely ignores and shifts whenever the fuck it feels like. Attempting to drink water or polish your monocle will trigger the most violent upshift of your life.</p><p><b>Structural Integrity</b></p><p>In order to preserve the Lincoln Town Car for future generations, do not park it in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>“I actually cannot be found liable for this,” I yell over the sound of the compressor spinning to an unfathomable rotational speed. “For all intents and purposes, I am considered a ward of the state and not my own legally responsible entity.” My calm words do not placate my passenger, who is now clawing into the hard-touch plastic-esque dash upholstery hard enough that I would be worrying about the integrity of the passenger side airbag module, had it still existed in this timeline.</p><p>I am sure to take the time to enunciate my words very clearly because my passenger does not appear to be paying their full attention to this conversation. This is of course irritating to me: by nature of my divine job controlling this automobile, my attentions and loyalties are naturally split, but as a mere passenger they have no duties of their own but to simply have good manners. Part of having good manners is not being quite so obvious about staring at the rapidly rising needle on the speedometer with great, eye-bulging concern. I decide to say something about it just as the needle pins itself well past the range of indicated speed.</p><p>“Yeah, that speedometer actually reads like 25% under after I put those used Mickeys on this hooptie. Fun fact, they were like ten years old so I got a smoking deal on them.” This will work. I am reassuring them that I am a serious adult who does not spend his disposable income frivolously.<br/></p><p>

At last, we blow past a radar cop and the LS400 sprouts a cloud of shimmering metallic chaff. The chaff fills the electromagnetic spectrum with incredible amounts of noise, frying the circuits inside the cop’s gun as well as every unshielded ECU for a city block. I glance in the rear-view mirror at his rapidly diminishing form, struggling to right himself in the wake of the bargey Toyota.<br/></p><p>For some reason, I am no longer selected in the future to drive for the work lunch carpool. I would be more upset about it, except that maintaining conversation during the drive is always so <i>stressful.</i></p>

<p>Our society’s most powerful metaminds had collectively come together in femtoseconds and identified the ideal vehicle for all right-thinking people: the 1989 Renault Fuego Turbo. After this day, they boomed from nanoscale vibratory speakers embedded within the smart concrete of our cities and homes, the manufactories would no longer produce a less ideal automobile than the Fuego.</p><p>Naturally, the price of new Toyota Corollas skyrocketed as their owners realized they had a hot commodity on their hands. Come get your <i>pre-ban</i> Toyotas, they shrieked into the speaknet almost immediately. Those who still could dimly remember the existence of the nation of France gave them their blood money, stuffing their coffers with the finest untraceable digital currency in exchange for anything <i>resembling</i> a Japanese economy car.</p><p>Weeks later, society was in ruins, every available surface clustered with Fuegos which had knocked their engines clean in half after their owners entered the Turbo Zone one too many times. The metamind keepers assembled, discussed the findings of their infallible machines. Surely there could not have been some mistake, they said, there must be some reason the Fuego Turbo is the only vehicle our society should drive that we just can’t see with our pitiful meat brains.</p><p>Myself, I was just happy at this twist of fate which had produced for me so many newly-manufactured spare parts for my vintage Fuego. Perhaps, I thought, I might even be able to drive it all the way to work once, assuming I could get enough spare parts. I’d probably have to take my thick hard-light-cover copy of <i>Metamind Hacking For Dummies</i> out of the trunk first, though.</p>

<p>They probably shouldn’t have told me it couldn’t be done. When I returned to the workshop, the thought of there being ideas thinkable by man that were not achievable by man stuck in my mind like a cube of side-window safety glass tucking itself into the bench seat of your car forever. I could feel its cutting edge day and night, throughout the time that I now realize I was driven by madness.</p><p>Madness though it may have been, the result was extremely practical. I popped open the door to my garage, dislodging the layers of trash and vines that had grown over the door during my project, and faced the world. With not much more than a turn of the key, the twin-turbocharged V12 first-gen Honda Odyssey I had constructed was unleashed upon the neighbourhood. Once my eyes had adapted to the wall of nonstop flames leaping onto the windshield from the hood-exit dump pipes, I was ready to go to the grocery store.</p><p>I find it hard to pinpoint just what is creating the smouldering smell when I pull into the parking lot of the Faithful Foods. My primary suspects are, in order from least to most suspicious, the brake pads, the windshield laminate, and the Hyundai Sonata I parked next to, its paint and trim instantly blistering in the wake of the heat wave lofting from the exterior side-mounted air-air intercoolers.</p><p>Finally, I kill the engine, and it is only once the turbochargers finish spinning down that I can hear the breathless wail of the municipal air raid siren over them. As if it realizes it is screaming about the sky falling for no apparent reason, it too falls silent, the utility-cammed 440 at its base grudgingly returning to a patchy idle.</p><p>Some motherly grid of sensors has been pushed outside of its tolerable range by the visual, auditory and psychic impact of the big Japanese people-mover, I convince myself. Inside the lobby of the grocery store, two workers are banging furiously with prybars on a rusted-shut iron door marked “CIVIL DEFENSE SHELTER.”</p><p>I was in and out of the grocery store in about fifteen minutes, thanks to the fact that everyone formerly inside was now hustling their way to the bomb shelter. Honda was right, I think as the Odyssey lays two nightmare-black patches on the face of the parking lot. These things <i>did</i> make an excellent grocery getter.</p>

<p>My detailer called, and from previous experience, I could always tell when it was bad news. Sure, I had pushed the envelope a lot this time, dumping a car from my buddy’s back forty onto his lap without any kind of notice. I first figured out that I had fucked up when he sent me a text, congratulating me on finally discovering a “challenge worthy of my skills.”</p><p>A little background: my detailer is from one of those Eastern European countries that existed in an almost constant state of guerrilla war for the past forty years. He’s <i>over</i> forty. When he walks, I can hear metal jangling, which he tells me is “old floorpan.” Floorpan from what? “From tank.” What kind of tank? At that, he frowns, and usually returns to his work. We have our little routines.</p><p>Back to the call: it was pretty obvious it was bad news. He wanted me to come down to the shop and show me what he had discovered. It couldn’t be worse than a cluster of dead rats caught mid-orgy like the last time, I said. His frown was somehow audible over the phone, and so I immediately put on some pants and hopped in the ol’ family truckster.</p><p>When I finally reached his warehouse, I looked in the detailing bay. I saw a wet floor, lots of soaps and detergents lying around, and no car. Funny thing was, the tires and wheels still seemed to be there. I was so focused on trying to find my car, that I didn’t hear the metallic ringing of my detailer approaching from behind.</p><p>“Turns out,” he said, “mouse turds were structural.”<br/></p>

<p>I worked the tiller like it owed me money, trying desperately against all odds to keep the Cadillac upright. The big-body Chevy seemed hostile to my demands, and continued doing its best impression of a drunk waiter dropping a stack of buffet plates onto the floor.</p><p>Some smooth handwork and a judicious application of throttle finally brought the ship around, straightening it out just enough that the suspension could rest for a small moment before I began to apply countersteer. I was getting pretty good at this, having practiced ever since the Caddy’s original owner was sent to the mass guillotine for crimes against humanity and the car reassigned to me by the Ministry of Property. They were right; I was definitely more deserving of its love.</p><p>Finally, I powerslid the land barge down a highway embankment and into the abandoned parking lot of the marina, bare except for the occasional blood-stained yachter’s hat. I could scarcely feel anything, testament both to the fantastic suspension and the ability of the mud-terrain KO3s to soak up cracked pavement, parking blocks, and gold bars alike.</p><p>The People had called me out here this shift, told me to see if I could find some of the last holdouts, clinging to their Randian ideals of self-sufficiency. I did a quick lap of the parking lot and was about to leave when I heard some whispering. Reaching on the poor-quality yet also idealistically union-made power window switch, I was able to come face to face with Capital.</p><p>“Saaaaay, that’s a Cadillac, isn’t it? I used to have an Audi, back in the day. Tell you what, do you have any health care I can terminate?” hissed a voice from the bushes.<br/></p><p>“Yeah, I got myself a real honey of a government-issued plan. Single payer. It’s even got&hellip; <i>prescriptions</i>,” I whistled back, my right hand reaching for the centre-console harpoon controls.<br/></p>

<p>I wasn’t always against German cars. In fact, for awhile, I worked on the team that made one of the most iconic German sports cars of all time: the base model 1977 Porsche 924. We considered it extremely adequate, and my team of only the finest Teutonic ubermensch had no equals in the company when it came to building a great sports car for cheap.</p><p>We were ready to put it out, let the world see that exotic sports handling could be had with only an eighty-seven horsepower motor salvaged from a Soviet tractor. That’s when Porsche Corporate stopped us. The Americans won’t understand, they told us, while wringing their hands over stacks of envelopes addressed to them from the Hague. We don’t need to call any special attention to ourselves, they said while furtively glancing at the entrance to make sure no Israeli bounty hunters were sneaking up on them from the lobby.</p><p>Sure, you can say that we failed to make a sports car that was capable of outrunning a base-model Vanagon, but I take pride in the fact that at least we didn’t work at Bosch.</p>

<p>Like an approximate one in every three hundred North Americans, I struggled with Alfa Romeo ownership. It started gently at first, just like I’m sure you’ve convinced yourself that Alfa ownership has been for you.</p><p>Just something to have fun with on the weekends. No serious commitment. One morning, though, something broke. It was the shift knob, because I leaned on it kind of hard and it was a forty-year-old piece of sunbaked plastic. I’d need a new one, after all, this fine Italian convertible had served me so well for almost the entire day I’d owned it.</p><p>Soon I was learning Italian in order to understand ancient parts microfiche, pausing and replaying the book-on-tape when I would take a particularly hard corner and the only remaining functional speaker would cut out. Always early to the junkyard on weekends, I would growl and hiss at other Alfisti who dared to come close to my find. My wife and kids started to ask uncomfortable questions how I would rub my arms, trying to stimulate my skin, pump more blood to the surface so that the Red Cross would let me fill up another bag of plasma for donation.</p><p>Eventually, even my dog left me, after I told him I could no longer afford milkbones because it was time for another engine-out wiring harness replacement. Soon after I sold my base-model Civic daily driver in order to afford a new V6 head gasket set, I stopped going to work entirely. Just had too much to do at home. No problem at all.</p><p>But there was hope. In my weakest moment, I came across Alfaholics Anonymous, a vigilante group that goes to great effort to wean people like you and me away from the grim omen of Italian sportscar ownership. Their programs are very affordable - much cheaper than, say, a set of Alfasud inboard rotors - and they outfit you with this neat collar that shocks you every time you think about mortgaging your house to buy a gently-used off-lease 4C. In fact, I haven’t thou<b><i>AAAAAAGHHH</i></b></p>

<p>You are at a posh private school, angry because the nanny had some kind of family emergency and couldn&rsquo;t drop off Zjaden this morning. That’s when you feel it, on some level beyond the physical.</p><p>When you look up from your smartphone, the normally-taciturn sun visors of your Audi SQ5 start flapping. The dashboard flashes a series of increasingly dire warnings, finally settling on “BIOHAZARD DEFENSE ACTIVATED.&ldquo;</p><p>You feel as if you are now constantly in a car crash, but you are still parked. Barely a breath later, the exterior glass explodes under the strain, showering you in glimmering cubes. With the interior of the Audi now open to the air, that&rsquo;s when you <i>hear</i> it.</p><p>

TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br/></p><p>The sky is growing dark in what is left of the rear-view mirror. Is it a tornado? Are you caught in a terrorist attack?<br/></p><p>It has not stopped. In fact, it grows closer. TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE <br/></p><p>Children are crying on the sidewalk, including Zjaden, who has collapsed face-first onto the pavement, blood streaming from his ears and eyes. You know in your heart this is Judgment Day.<br/></p><p>Finally, a rusty 1999 Range Rover Classic bursts into view, a cloud of impenetrable ash in the shape of a human skull trailing it. The front end is gone, mangled back to the bare suspension supports which are welded directly to the valve covers of the immense green engine that is its screaming heart.</p><p>As it passes you, the rear air suspension of the Rover explodes, showering the battered side of your carbonized Audi with shrapnel of only the finest British manufacture. Somehow you remain conscious, but you know it is too late for your son. The last thing you see before the cloud overtakes you is the words “STRANGE ROVER” punched into the remaining intact metal of the truck’s tailgate.</p><p>That night, you return to your $1.3 million McMansion atop Posh Hill and declare your intention to leave your husband. Coming this close to death has changed you, but you can&rsquo;t admit it to yourself or to him that you were living a lie all this time. He refuses, your contract of mutual support inviolable. The argument becomes heated. A revolver is withdrawn from your purse. Two shots, centre mass.<br/></p><p>As you walk to the desiccated husk of your Audi, dripping liquid diesel from its panels into the storm sewer, you take your time. It is a certainty that the police will never arrive. They are too busy following a luxury SUV after getting pollution and noise complaints from the railroad and airport.<br/></p>

<p>I was trying to be more spiritual. It was important to me, knowing that there was something greater than man out there and that the block would take at least 20 pounds of boost. In my darkest hour, I found the K-car inside. Inside my neighbour’s backyard, that is, with grass up to the wing mirrors.</p><p>My grandfather always said a car that you didn’t purchase with a machete was not a real car. He went to prison for murder, but later I realized an alternate meaning to that lesson when I pulled this beauty of a ‘94 Spirit R/T out of the weeds. The bill of sale just said “in trade for not calling the cops.” Calling the cops for what, I asked. My neighbour eyed me suspiciously and then re-locked the eight padlocks on his outer door as he retreated into his house.</p><p>Before long, I had the little crapwagon up and running. I was happily commuting, enjoying the whistle of persistent boost leaks, when I was overcome by the holy spirit.</p><p>When I awoke, the firefighters told me that this happens a lot when you have rusted-out exhaust, no floorpans, and insist on doing fifty-shots while idling at lights “for laughs.” Their words had some serious weight, and I considered my sinful lifestyle in light of this near-death experience. Then I asked them if they would let me drive the firetruck the rest of the way.</p>

<p>“Morta<i>dello</i>,” the cheese counter lady at Wilmington’s says to me with no small degree of impatience. <br/></p><p>

It’s not that the grocery store was a <i>bad</i> place to go, per se. I just didn’t want to be there. As I gently push my cart around corners, respectfully obeying the extents of my space envelope and the personal property of others, I begin to feel that it is more like an extended bout of parking than some kind of supermarket barrel race of yore. You don’t need me to tell you that I hate parking.<br/></p><p>Ahead of me, I see some autocrossers. They are noticeable because of their tanned calves, toned from endless coursewalks and staying in a runner’s stance at the primo marshaling spot, getting ready to run if that Corvette gets sideways on them again. They are chatting about the lines they took through that tricky bit in the produce section, because of course they are. As I approach the argument is heading well past “crescendo” and into “call the police.”</p><p>I decide to take any excuse I could to break up the monotony of pushing a badly-aligned shopping cart around, and Get Involved. As I had been trained by SCCA officials, I throw a pillow on the ground and squirt them both in the face with water while loudly scolding them.</p><p>“You two are fighting like a pair of <i>NASCAR</i> drivers,” I yelp.<br/></p><p>In the background, a record scratches as the in-house grocery store DJ slips in an unmopped puddle and falls, fracturing his C4 and C6 vertebrae. The two autocrossers pause for a moment, staring at the prone man, and then resume their argument, this time specifically regarding the unfairness of multipliers for classing.</p><p>It’s probably better this way. Last week, I decided to stop going to the Rallycross Grocery because the all-terrain tires on my shopping cart wouldn’t stop debeading.</p>

<p>Ever since I fixed the loose negative battery cable for my neighbour who worked over at NASA JPL, he’s been leaving his garbage bin unlocked. Don’t say I didn’t appreciate it.</p><p>A few days ago, he threw out something that I considered to be the pinnacle of trash. It turned out that some Silicon Valley eggheads had developed a security robot that is not very good at securing things, and a group of rambunctious high schoolers took a break from cramming for intro calculus to push it over and steal the motors. After that, the broken shell somehow ended up at my neighbour’s place, where he threw it in the trash after removing all of the autonomous parts for some space probe or something, who even cares?</p><p>To tell you the truth, I was getting mighty tired of showing up for work in person. While it gave me an excuse to exercise my harem of hoopties, when I got there they generally frowned upon me taking “smoke breaks” to infuse the cars with artisanal home-brewed Seafoam even though the ritual features prominently in my religion. If I was going to make any progress at all on my projects, I was going to need a lot less commuting time and a lot more wrenching time. I thought back to a television program I had seen. Of course. A telepresence robot would be my saviour, its blinking lights, jive-talking robot butler mouth and high-pressure clamps winning both career approval and paycheques for me.</p><p>Early the next morning, my coworkers, holding their ears, entered the building under duress. I could barely hear their screams for help over the sound of the nitromethane-choked exhaust odd-firing through the old-ass Buick V6 I had lying under the workbench.</p><p>Since I did not see the point in driving the robot to work in my own car, I had decided to put some pretty serious firepower inside “Cackles” so he could drive <i>himself</i> to work. On the highway. The exhaust hadn’t bothered me all that much, between my almost-total lack of hearing and my belief that their discussions about their weekends would somehow still be louder.</p><p>Well, you know what they say: science marches on. I decided to still close out the day, knowing that the cleaning staff would probably need a bit of extra elbow grease to clean the smoke and oil stains off the walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;YOU FOOL,&rdquo; yelps Twist Hardslab, the protagonist of the movie. &ldquo;MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO HAVE SUCH POWER.&rdquo;</p><p>The lead evil storm chaser, Dieter, walks to the podium in his overly-zippered well-tailored black on black uniform.</p><p>&ldquo;Ve haff ze upper hand, Doktor Haaaaaardslab,&rdquo; he intones nasally before flipping the switch. A miniature tornado descends from the ceiling as the immense machine comes to life. They’ve done it. &ldquo;In zis moment, I have come closer to God than ever before.&rdquo;</p><p>Something goes wrong. The mini tornado breaks into two tornadoes, and one wreaks havoc on the sensitive innards of the Final Weather Solution. Dieter Stormhauser is pinned underneath a steel column as the machine erupts into a collection of jagged metal and ash.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you were right about one thing, Dieter,&rdquo; says Twist Hardslab while adjusting the rake on his academic-issue fedora as the camera pans over the bloody stump that once was Dieter’s left arm. &ldquo;You definitely had the <i>upper hand</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two things you need to know about me: First, I have absolutely no standards when it comes to automobiles, and two, I will drive any free automobile for quite a long period of time. When they handed me a rental loaner car at the bodyshop and told me that the mileage was <i>unlimited</i>, I was in my element. Next stop: Mexico.</p><p>It turns out that when you sign up to run the Baja 1000, nobody really checks your ownership or registration documentation very closely. What this means in practice is that you can spend a week in the desert hammering the living tar out of a rental Corolla, and to pass up such an opportunity would be downright wrong.</p><p>As I howled through the dunes, passing prepared stadium trucks due to the ironclad law of physics that rental cars are faster than any other known car, I had ample time to rest in the air conditioning and try to figure out why the radio wasn’t picking up any music anymore. It didn’t really matter, because after I jumped a dry creekbed and blew out the rear windshield from unibody twist, I decided it was better off as someone else’s problem. In fact, I would probably leave a very negative review of the rental agency on Yelp. How dare they rent me a car that was so unsuited for mild offroad use?</p><p>At the end of the event, I walked past the lines of cheering spectators and complimentary champagne bottles - no thanks, can’t you see I’m <i>driving</i> here? - and picked up my trophy. After a quick but grudging photo shoot, I was back in the car, on my way back to the bodyshop. Surely they had finished in the intervening week I had been thousands of miles from home, and would have had ample time to fix the rust on my metallic baby-shit-brown G-body.</p><p>When I arrived, the rental agent at the front desk looked at me, then at the car, then back at me. She frowned. The steaming abstract art that was once a new Corolla was starting to bleed oil onto the thirsty tarmac.</p><p>“Looks like the gas is a little low,” she muttered. “You should have pre-paid for gas if you didn’t have time to fill it up.”<br/></p>

<p>“Jesus <i>God</i>,” my agent muttered to the sky while pinching the bridge of her nose in an attempt to keep her head from exploding. “For one thing, I’m <i>not</i> your agent. This is the employment agency.” I was getting off to a bad start on finding a new gig.</p><p>Sure, I had the traditional unemployment excuses - bad boss hated it when I bolted a Weiand to the ice cream truck even though I configured engine management responsibly, PTA didn’t appreciate the new substitute teacher showing up in a twin-engined Rambler that shot fire and had a real human skull for a shift knob, the whole gamut - but I think overall it was just a bad economy. I had told my agent so, and she responded by downing half a bottle of pills from a secret compartment at the back of her desk drawer and going to sleep right then and there.</p><p>After a few minutes, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Pushing her head to the side, I removed the thick stack of job listings from under it and started flipping through the pages. Nothing was particularly appealing, until I got to the last job on the list. It seemed like some local first-world nation had recently impeached its President and they needed a temp to take care of things for a few weeks. I was definitely the guy for that gig, even though I wasn’t all that proficient in macroeconomic policy or Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Weeks later, the American political press cornered me. It turned out that I had accidentally single-handedly reversed the decline of the economy, fixed trade deals, launched a manned mission to Mars and ushered in world peace. What was my secret, they asked me? What do other world leaders need to know in order to save humanity?</p><p>“For decades, Americans have been fat and lazy. Our sloth was disturbing, and we allowed the weak to clog our roads.” I scowled at them, self-editing my words for cusses that would undermine my speech by being bleeped out. “I have banned the automatic transmission, that opulent scourge of a decadent society in failure. Everything follows from this.”<br/></p>

<p>They called it the “tiny house movement,” but their houses were not all that tiny, nor did they move. You don’t need me to tell you that the latter part was what got my goat the most, and so I decided to give these unwashed hippies a tiny house movement of my own.</p><p>I called my importer so quickly that my smartphone was still smoking after I hung up, though in retrospect that was probably due mostly to the “almost-okay” batteries I had picked up on eBay for it a few months prior. He slapped a thing of beauty in my front yard, a Daihatsu HiJet that had been rolled so many times it was barely recognizable. After I ran it through my dishwasher in a good pots &amp; pans cycle to clean out all the blood, I had a perfectly serviceable kei truck frame on which to build my masterpiece.</p><p>Only one problem remained: where would I get a <i>house</i>? I asked all of my closest confidantes and not a single one of them knew anything about woodworking. I was ready to give up on this project and transfer the kei truck frame into some kind of demented Meyers Manx abortion when it hit me. Meyers Manx. Fibreglass. <i>Composites</i>. Didn’t I just see a composite house at the hardware store?</p><p>After duct-taping the on-sale store-display child’s playhouse to the frame of the Daihatsu, I now had a serviceable “tiny house movement.” To celebrate, I spun out a savage burnout from the HiJet’s overstressed ten-inch tires from the comfort of my own couch.</p><p>It was only after leaving the Homehatsu that I realized I had made a mistake. Nobody could ever live in this house, I gasped. It didn’t have a garage!</p>

<p>It’s hard to make friends when you move to a new country. All my time in South Korea, I felt like I didn’t know anyone and couldn’t relate to the random strangers I would meet in bars. That is, until I told them that I once worked at Honda.</p><p>From then on, whenever I went to the bar, dozens of Hyundai employees would ambush me, wanting to hear the secrets of continuous improvement, the specific humidity levels within the factory paint booths, and if I ever saw with my own two eyes the immense glass tomb that housed Soichiro Honda’s corporeal body in a state of permanent cryogenic slumber.</p><p>I would accept their gifts of fried chicken and sweet-smelling booze, and then I would spin them one bullshit story after another. The secret to making friends, I was convinced in those days, was to just tell people you worked for a Japanese industrial consortium which is well-regarded the world over, and the rest would take care of itself.</p><p>Late one night, as the pub was nearing its closing hour and I no longer had the capacity for more bar snacks and high-octane methamphetamine, I started to tell them the biggest whopper of my career.</p><p>“Our secret,” and I paused for emphasis as the Hyundai engineers leaned in real close, trying to hold themselves so still that their notepads vibrated perceptibly from the muscle tension, “was that we used to call Subaru up and give them our bad ideas.”</p><p>Suddenly, I heard a sharp shout. An extremely tall Japanese man in whiteface and a ten gallon cowboy hat stood up from the bar and faced me.<br/></p><p>“You <i>fuckers</i>!” he screamed. “I <i>knew</i> the Tribeca wasn’t one of ours!”<br/></p>

<p>Since time immemorial, man has chased after the Toyota Celica. What <i>is</i> the Toyota Celica, scholars asked in smoke-filled reading rooms, their pipes shaking to and fro as they pontificated their way out of an eternal frustration. Is it a curvy, front-wheel drive girly grand tourer, or is it a barking-mad rear-wheel drive sports coupe with glorious Mustang-aping bumpers that taught an impoverished Japanese nation how to love themselves again?</p><p>One morning, we received an urgent telegraph from the Consulting Detective down the street. It seemed he had made a critical break in the Case of What Is A Toyota Celica Anyway. Since it would be unseemly at the very least to give that information over the radio telegraph system, he invited us to join him at the Men’s Club that evening in order to share his findings.</p><p>That night, we waited in overstuffed armchairs, tense to a man. Even the Irish gentlemen, who stood outside in their special section and looked into the parlour through leaded-glass windows, were chattering happily about what this great new scientific discovery could be. Had the Consulting Detective finally found an answer to what the Celica was?</p><p>It was not to be, and in fact his findings split our group into a pair of warring factions, never to reunite. As we bloodied our fists on one another, we all desperately tried to forget what the Consulting Detective had told us: that the Toyota Celica was also available as a <i>convertible</i>.</p>

Be particularly careful of attending events such as “LeMons” races, rally event spectating and “just dropping by” the junkyard to “pick up a few things.” This is where their ideological leaders reside, and they are in fact receiving new mission orders from them and attempting to brainwash you into purchasing a 1981 Ford Durango.</p><p>They know what a 1981 Ford Durango looks like.</p><p>They drive a car, instead of a crossover, sports utility vehicle or pickup truck. Contact the DOT immediately if they are driving an oddly small van or anything with the steering wheel on the wrong side: do not attempt to stop them from throwing their money away on air filters and replacement body parts on Yahoo! Auctions (a known hotbed of international lowlifes profiting from this behaviour).</p><p>If you suspect a family member or friend may fit any of these descriptions, immediately contact the US DOT hotline for further advice. A reward is offered for statements leading to a successful conviction.<br/></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild&rdquo; Billy Mays here for Sullivans&rsquo;s Aircraft Remover. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of pesky old airframes clogging up your backyard. With one spray, those planes are GONE!</p>

<p>In just one hour, I&rsquo;ve done a decade&rsquo;s worth of Boeing recycling on these old 737s someone dumped behind the barn out back. Don&rsquo;t even lift a finger to clean up the leftover interior, either: just keep spraying!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just for airplanes, either - look what it does to this Bell 204 that flew into some power lines over my place. Good as new! The liquefied iron&rsquo;s great for lawns as well. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: Sullivan&rsquo;s Aircraft Remover is not to be used on aircrafts you wish to remain operational. Do not use Aircraft Remover on things which are not aircraft, including but not limited to: cars, elevators, lawns, the Catholic Church, or taco seasoning. Undefined behaviour may result.</p>

<p>Most men of science, and indeed most men of journalism, would agree that racing a dazzle-camouflage box Caprice through the middle of a Veterans Day parade is at least in poor taste. Add in the open headers and the howling grandpa grips, and there’s no debate, not even with that annoying guy at all the campus parties who demands to be devil’s advocate.</p><p>I pulled on the hockey-stick-long handle for the hydraulic handbrake and the B-body leapt from weight transfer, suddenly transitioning from charging rhinoceros to demure ballerina. Thing about ballerinas is they can hit pretty fucking hard, and so did the target of this metaphor when I climbed back on the throttle. With some deft pedal-and-wheel work, I whipped the heavy-duty Chevy into a back alley and off the main drag before the 5-0 was able to calibrate the racism mode of their Mk1 eyeballs well enough to notice the shimmering zebra pattern that was setting off car alarms along the parade route.</p><p>On the other side of the tenement block, I let the Caprice eat, feeling out the grip of the mixed-surface cocktail of parched tarmac, scattered garbage and neighbourhood pets. I pulled another hard handbrake turn, this time flying over the curb of a bike lane divider and onto the highway on-ramp. From there, it was a straight shot home. I released the throttle and dipped to cruise speed, because despite the cloud of noxious soot being ejaculated from the eight angry sawzalled pipes hanging off my small-block, I was very concerned about fuel economy and conservation.</p><p>At last, I had arrived at the video rental store. I gripped the DVD copy of <i>Gone In 60 Seconds</i> (the original - who do you take me for?) in my hot hands. My procrastination had done me no favours, this disc having sat on my stairs for years upon years past the due date until I suddenly realized that morning I had forgotten to return it in all that time.</p><p>The handle rattled, but the door did not budge. Beside me, the howling of police sirens as the highway filled with red and blue flashing lights, on their way past the exit to the parking lot in which I stood. I was glad the Caprice, now stalled after an uncomfortably long dieseling, was no longer detectable on either the visible or audible spectrums.</p><p>I tried the door again, and again. Confused, I looked inside the Blockbuster. It was empty, devoid of all furnishings. I guess it was a holiday, after all.</p>

<p>The year is 2172. We’ve been at war with the machines for what feels like my entire life. I’m so old that I can even remember the point where eventually we collectively got tired of being afraid all the time, and just got on with things. Now, once in awhile a Prius Excelsior wearing scratched-out serial numbers will swoop through a playground zone and claim a few kids with its carbon-fibre aero splitter. That’s just the way things are now, our politicians told everyone. It’s not like <i>I</i> have the free time to fix it, we explained to our kids. It became the New Normal.</p><p>A group of us never stopped fighting, but we found ourselves outmatched in every regard by the gangs of malevolent self-driving cars that roamed our highways and - dare I say - byways. Any move we could make would be struck down immediately, our primitive human reflexes so predictable that a “more optimum” moveset could be generated from their miles of cortex wiring in less time than it took our irises to dilate in the wake of their LED headlights.</p><p>One day, we found a secret weapon. The core code of the robots laid in parking, our scientists reasoned. What if we just parked <i>really poorly</i>? We recruited teenagers from the local driving school. Their fear behind the wheel and general inability to judge distances would be our new weapons.</p><p>It worked, better than we ever could have imagined. Neo-Tokyo Central Mallcourt 17-A was the first place we tested it. A football-playing D student managed to wedge a 1998 New Beetle turbo across four spots, while still somehow leaving the rear bumper pointing out into the lane of traffic. The trap set, we waited from afar, my partner keeping overwatch with an ancient high-caliber tank-killer rifle left over from the last human war. With its electromagnetic scope, we could easily target the most vulnerable parts of the enemy should something go wrong.</p><p>I heard it before I saw it. From the highway off-ramp, a jet-black Lincoln Patriot pulled itself into the parking lot, the ultrasonic array filling the electromagnetic spectrum with a deadly cone. As it approached the back of the New Beetle, some strange genetic memory compelled the Patriot to come to a complete stop.</p><p>It chirped, unable to understand the current parking situation, and then chirped again and again, faster and faster. As we watched through the scope, the bank of silicon that controlled its self-driving and morality core began to overheat, glowing hot as the processors pegged themselves in incomprehension. After so many years of self-driving cars, the Lincoln was simply not capable of understanding the depths to which humanity could sink, and it was tearing its own brain apart in an attempt to categorize this new threat.</p><p>As the big Lincoln dropped dead with one last pitiful warble from its horn, the cloud of burning solder floated past our noses. It smelled like victory.</p>

<p>In the face of declining financing for public radio, it became obvious to the NPR illuminati that they would have to pick someone much cheaper. “Much cheaper” is basically my middle name, so I found myself paid to sit in the bomb shelter I call a parts closet and tell Normal America how they should repair problems on their Normal Car.</p><p>“Caller, you’re on the air,” I would crackle into the surprisingly expensive microphone they had nailed to the PB-stained work surface of my desk. “Tell us about your problem.”<br/></p><p>They would speak hesitantly, even before the five minute delay. To them, some combination of demons, issued into the world to plague humanity for all eternity, had been summoned through the engine block of their Camry and generated some kind of nervous rubbing sound or a peculiar squeaking that could only be heard on faint left turns.</p><p>On calls such as this, I fell back on the training I had received from my parents. My father, you see, was a preacher. And not the nice Catholic kind, either. Fire and brimstone hung over the heads of me and my siblings, taking on an almost tangible form. One morning, however, I realized that my father’s true power laid in words, and I would twist those words for my own purposes, just as he did.</p><p>“In your hubris, you have strayed far from the true purpose of automobiles,” I would tell them, my voice leaden with anguish over their suffering. “I don’t know how, but cars can sense such things. They can feel your lack of faith.”</p><p>Then there would be dead silence as they studied their life, their past mistakes. The human mind was convenient in this way, yearning to derive causality from noise.</p><p>There was always some mistreatment, some ignorance of the Best Practices, that they could point back to as being evidence of having been negligent towards their four-wheeled family member. Inevitably, a little gasp of realization would slip from their mouth, and I would hit them again.</p><p>“For your <i>penance</i>, you must install a nitrous oxide fogger and thirty-one-inch mud terrains, as it has been written in the Factory Service Manual provided to us by the Golden Manufacturer of the Great East.”<br/></p><p>As it sunk in, and I knew I had them on the line, I would drop it. Other listeners, too, were no doubt straying, and needed to return to my flock.</p><p>“Do not turn away from Toyota in this hour of need,” I would bark. “Tribute is necessary to keep your engine at peak operating performance.”<br/></p><p>Sometimes, I would tap them for a little extra for the office lunch kitty. After all, I was providing a valuable service to the community, the true way of public radio.</p>

<p>In the interest of austerity, the federal government was slowly whittled down by bureaucrats until almost none of it remained. Eventually, they cast their eyes upon the Transportation Safety Board. Deciding it was actually pretty important, I was appointed as its head and, in fact, the sole employee.</p><p>Keeping costs down was difficult at first; I wanted to intensely scrutinize every piece of metal fatigue, measure tire marks, interview witnesses. You know, nerd shit. Come budget review season, however, it was determined that nobody actually needed to do any of this, and so my management of the Board transitioned quite quickly to more of an open-and-shut setup.</p><p>One morning, I was called out to an icy runway. Arriving in my mud-terrain-shod Renault Dauphine and driving through one of the many gaps in the dilapidated airport runway fence, I floored it to let the open-pipe exhaust cackle a stream of half-burned nitromethane before shutting the engine off. It’s good for the valves, I explained to the assembled airline staff as I emerged, Thermos full of marguerita in one hand and my trusty loaded nine millimeter semiautomatic in the other. You could never be too careful.</p><p>It seemed that the pilot had skidded off the runway and gotten stuck in the grass. I looked at the runway, then at the plane. After a few seconds, I remembered that I was here to close tickets. I turned to the frightened pilot, and asked him one quick question.</p><p>“You ripped a burnout first, right?”<br/></p><p>He didn’t know what that was. Worried, he told me that it probably wasn’t a traction issue at all, but instead something regarding communication and human factors. I frowned. You couldn’t put more horsepower or more grip under a human factor, I figured, so there was almost nothing for me to put in the final report.</p><p>“Look,” I said, “these tires clearly weren’t hot enough. Everyone knows that you need to light them up in the water box before you try and make your pass.”<br/></p><p>I could barely hear the pilot’s arguments over the sound of the Dauphine firing back up. He was angry that I didn’t understand that planes did not directly drive the wheels, that taxiing was done with magic engines that don’t involve a clutch. Sure, buddy, and you don’t fly by taking this thing off a sick jump and holding it in the air for a long time.<br/></p><p>The airline bureaucrats looked confused, then immediately fell in with my recommendation, excoriating the pilot for not knowing the first rule of safe airplane operation. They knew which side of the bread their butter was on, or at least they would if butter were still safe to eat.</p>

<p>When our automakers began to run out of ideas in the go-go days of the late 90s and early 00s, one of the first places they retreated to was the “offroad culture.” Appropriating dabs and dots of their beliefs, the manufacturers would slap faux bedliner, push bars, rub strips and nearly imperceptible suspension lifts on anything in their portfolio that seemed to be selling a little slowly.</p><p>Subaru practically invented this game while barely looking up from taking massive hits of the budget-priced pancake-motored crack pipe they called the Impreza, but one day they tipped their hand. Into this world came the third generation Outback <i>sedan</i>, forged in the active volcanoes of New England and dispensed into the driveways of unsuspecting Middle Americans who saw themselves as outdoorsy and yet despairing of the <i>image crisis</i> that a station wagon would bring upon their family.</p><p>I was no Johnny-come-lately to the SUS party. Years ago, when I first scraped my hand on a rolled Brat at the junkyard and inadvertently allowed the Subaru illness into my veins, the rolling fever dreams that ensued destroyed any hope I would have of someday owning a car that could <i>over</i>steer. What’s more, they psychically imparted unto me a full and true knowledge of this beast. Saddled with an automatic transmission though it may be, such a blemish would not discourage a true psychotic like myself from getting my hands on some mildly lifted sedan goodness.</p><p>For years, I saw none of them. I would drive my little commutes, occasionally joke about them with friends, and settle down into a comfortable life of owning Imprezas and asking out loud what that smell is and where that leak came from this week. One day, though, I saw it. On my commute, a mint (or at least streetworthy) black Outback sedan ripped through traffic.</p><p>Before I realized what I was doing, I had given chase, following the massive third-gen tail lights through a residential neighbourhood at an incredible (and increasing) velocity. It seemed to me that the owner had noticed a heavily dented Subaru with a wild-eyed operator following them, and used every ounce of the driving training they absorbed from a lifetime of watching action movies in a vain attempt to escape me.</p><p>While her functional suspension and big-lunged six-banger were easily able to outrun me in both the straights and the corners, I had no particular compunction against driving over lawns, through playground zones and playgrounds themselves. Besides, I was pretty sure I knew where she was going.</p><p>The chase came to an end when I had to pull in to the nearest gas station for some more oil, all the better to quell the insistent clacking within each of my single-slammer heads. I walked the five feet across the convenience store lot and said hello to the Outback Sedan owner, herself frantically pouring multiple gallons of oil into the engine in an attempt to get back on the road and start putting distance between us once again.</p><p>“What do you <i>want</i>?” she shrieked at me while rifling through her gym bag of a purse for a less-lethal directed-energy weapon with which to take me down.<br/></p><p>“I just wanted to park next to you. As you can see, I also have a Subaru.”<br/></p>

<p>True, it has been years since my ill-fated guest stint as host on <i>Mitsubishi Repair Theatre 3000</i>, but I still get the occasional fan at conventions who shakes my hand, transfers disease to my body, and wants to know how it all went down. When I hear this question, my eyes narrow, I rock back in the cheap plastic folding chair I have been provided by the event organizers, and I ask them: “do you <i>really</i> want to know?”</p><p>They always really want to know. I tell them about the Elantra.</p><p>Decades ago, in some kind of ex-Soviet gulag, representatives of the Hyundai heavy industrial concern met with representatives of the Mitsubishi hatred generation department. They exchanged pleasantries, showed Powerpoint presentations, and then signed a pact in blood that would haunt mankind for the rest of our days.</p><p>The long and the short of it is, if you found the right old Elantra and you found the right old Mitsubishi/Eagle/Plymouth/Dodge/forklift/Proton/Chinese station wagon, you could jam a hot little four banger in that Elantra and make it run twelves until the rod bearings decided to celebrate Spring Break in Puerto De Windowed Block. Nobody who was of sufficient internal twist could resist such a sleeper, and knowing my past as a man who made questionable automotive decisions, it should have been no surprise that the show’s writing staff wanted me to perform such a nightmare swap while their staff of comedians mocked my incompetence live.</p><p>Where did it all go wrong? Crankwalk. Yes, while Mitsubishi fanboys the universe over will tell you that the horror of crankwalk is a largely fictional beast caused entirely due to Chrysler malfeasance, it happened to me on that shop floor that fated night. It wasn’t at all the fact that, angered at having to retime the engine for the eighth time after I finally noticed the marks on the timing belt would never line up thanks to the decked head, I yanked the half-installed crank out of the short block and savagely beat one of their production assistants half to death with it. In fact, it was clear to me, my highly paid legal team, and a substantial out-of-court settlement whose terms are confidential that the crank walked itself directly out of the block and into his forehead.</p><p>It still ended better than the time I did drum brakes on Letterman.</p>

<p>We here at the Centre are all about helping. Our careers are dedicated to improving the lives of the poor unfortunates who end up in our many halfway houses, left adrift by an orphaned brand.</p><p>Let’s look at Tim. Tim used to own a Saab, but when he was caught trying to sell his mother’s Golden Retriever in order to afford replacement ignition cassettes, his family had him remanded to our custody. Through a proprietary combination of talk and convulsive electroshock therapies, we’ve made a fantastic breakthrough in Tim’s case. He will never be “normal,” but his doctors expect he will one day own a Subaru.</p><p>Please, won’t you give money to the Centre? Every dollar you give goes directly to those who are most at risk, whether it be pulling up obsolete parts fiches to find interchange parts, or to simply shock the living shit out of them until they realize they should just buy a car that they still make.</p>

<p>I’m at the alignment shop getting my wheels straightened out. You can smell it before you can hear it, which is well before you can see it. It’s a 60s Mopar four-door of some description, tottering its way along the road, burning as much oil as its asthmatic small-block can push past the slack rings.</p><p>I’ve been waiting for what feels like hours, hoping against hope that the fresh-out-of-high-school alignment tech is gifted enough with a torch to free up the rusted-solid jam nuts on my tie rods. The arrival of the Mopar is almost a welcome sight, and the sound of its clattering valvetrain is quite comforting as well.</p><p>Across the waiting room, I can see a middle-aged white male suddenly perk up. He sniffs the air, like a prairie dog searching for threats. Some unknown force propels him to the plate glass window of the shop, pressing his face against it with a loud squeak. The Mopar has captivated him, seized control of his body and spirit. I can faintly hear words emanating from his mouth in a manic babble. “General Lee, quad-barrel, resale value, double pumper, Barrett-Jackson,” he repeats over and over while beads of sweat form on his face.</p><p>By now, the old Dodge has finally, through great effort, pulled itself to a resentful halt outside the shop. Its engine diesels for a bit before it finally falls dead, and the owner steps out. From my perch in the waiting room, I can see the bushes behind him rustling. More middle-aged white males burst through the foliage, themselves repeating the mantra of auction grades and stories from their misspent youth. “Five hundred horsepower,” shrieks one of them while admiring the sole remaining hubcap, a severely dinged plastic piece from a Pontiac Sunbird. “Safer than a Prius,” adds another.</p><p>The owner pays them no mind, modulo a little shove to get one of them to move out of the way so he can open the door to the shop and join me in the waiting room. Eventually, the proprietor comes out from the back. He is familiar with these cars, having first seen them as a child driven by military dictators in his home country. Then as now, it was critically important that the drivers of them be able to safely reach the site of their purges and other crimes against humanity.</p><p>I am about to strike up a conversation with the driver of the old Monaco or Coronet or whatever when there is a horrible clattering from outside. An investment banker has just rolled his brand new F-Type into the parking lot in a tremendous accident, having spotted the vintage Dodge product from the road and decided to immediately make a ninety degree turn in which to bid upon it, jersey barrier be damned.</p><p>That’s when I see it. A severely dented but largely rust-free second generation CRX Si, driving past, a plume of blue smoke following it. I cannot stop my legs from forcing me out of the shop, through the throng of Delusional Mopar Guys, shrieking the code phrases that were burned into my prefrontal cortex by my brainwashers. “VTEC, Spoon, import drags,” I hear myself nattering. It is a beautiful car, a perfect gem that has never been surpassed. I am convinced this old Honda is worth upward of the GDP of New Mexico at auction, and tell the owner as such when I catch up to him on foot.</p><p>The driver, a middle-aged Lebanese father of two, rolls his eyes at me and calmly pulls a can of Mace from the pile in the back seat.</p>

<p>People had been telling me about Big Government all throughout my life. Whether it was through a bumper sticker, roadside screaming, or standing on a soapbox and handing out pamphlets with homophobic slurs written on them in red pen, I was often told not to trust the Man. Back then, I was naive. I couldn’t have guessed the depths of their depravity.</p><p>One morning, I needed a job. Through clumsy administration, I was finding that some of the beaters sticking out of my lawn were now becoming more maintenance resistant than usual. I would need new parts, and quite a few of them.</p><p>Where could I go that would give me a high-paying job in exchange for almost no work? Conventional wisdom in this North American life told me that job would lie no further than within the walls of my nearest City Hall. I put on my finest suit-coloured t-shirt and drove to that hallowed building, even going so far as to leave my mud-terrain-shod Toyota Van parked on the next street over so that it didn’t give them the wrong impression about me before they signed on the dotted line.</p><p>I sat in the office for a period of time, before the interviewer came out from the back. He was ready, he told me, to hear about what I had to offer. First, though, I made the mistake of asking just what it was they <i>did</i> at this department.</p><p>Roads. They built roads. My head started to swim. Roads came from the <i>government</i>? I was paying for them? I had assumed it was some sort of ill-intentioned charity from a maniac Howard Hughes type, demanding that people ride on this high-grip surface for what this tycoon in his sick mind assumed was “safety.”</p><p>I was barely able to breathe. My mouth felt dry. The room swam around me. Had I been poisoned by the free coffee he had provided me, out of some kind of foreign machine known as a “Keurig?” Germans. Of course it had to be Germans, I thought as my head hit the ground.</p><p>After I came to, the interviewer was standing over me, clutching a grip of ill-gotten cash. He admired my gumption and honesty, and he was willing to “pave over” our little disagreement with a handsome hiring bonus. Now that I had figured out the conspiracy, he explained to me, it was time to cash in as long as I didn’t go running to the local media about how unnecessary pavement really was.</p><p>It’s just as well, really. I had been looking to use up some of my spare summer tires before the compound got too old.</p>

<p>I had been coming to this little out-of-the-way diner for years. After some nice mountain twisties, it’s the first real prairie you’ll see. When I’m out and about in the area, I almost always stop in. The food isn’t that great, but the people are a whole other story.</p><p>That afternoon, as I was leaving the diner after engaging in solo combat with the Burger That Would Unmake A Man (their name), I saw across the parking lot a group of older men that I first assumed to be Corvette enthusiasts. While I walked over to them, I was mentally calculating how much cash I had on hand should one of their cars be wrapped around a pole on the main road, its delectable small-block V8 thoughtfully pre-ejected into a ditch for my parts shopping convenience.</p><p>They were definitely interested in things that turned in like Corvettes, at least. In point of fact, these gentlemen were <i>train</i> enthusiasts. I thought about it briefly, confused - how could anyone be fascinated by the weird boxy things that bring new cars and occasionally block important roads when I’m trying to get somewhere?</p><p>As they chattered amongst each other, my trained ear began to pick out the key aspects of their obsession. It was obvious that they enjoyed big horsepower engines and hauling lots of cargo, and a few of them also clearly had a thing for remembering obscure performance factoids about thousands of models that were no longer in production. I decided that I was close enough to these men that I could make a reasonable offer.</p><p>Walking away from the parking lot, the sound of their laughter hung behind me. Not a single one of them had any massive train turbochargers to sell me. None of them even <i>owned</i> a train to call their own. What kind of meet was that?</p>

<p>I could hear the tapping as the border guard swung his stick against the rocker panels of my car. Trying not to sweat, I put on my best neutrally-bored commuter face while waiting for him to lose interest and go away. That’s when he swung a little too hard, and finally broke through one of the massive rust holes in my rockers.</p><p>A crackling sound, then the sound of dozens of spray cans of grey RTV falling on the asphalt, tumbling from the special smugglers’ compartments I had built into them. The border guard was at the window now, ordering me out of the car, onto the grass.</p><p>“What <i>is</i> this?” he finally asked, after he and his buddies had torn my car down to its constituent elements and only found aerosol cans within it.<br/></p><p>“We can’t get it in Canada,” I whined, “and I really can’t draw a straight bead with the squeeze tubes!” I tried to make a gesture with my hands that mimicked having to caulk up an oil pan gasket, but it was very difficult with my hands in cuffs behind my back.<br/></p><p>On the way home from the border, I noticed that somehow my heavily worn interior now had fewer rattles after the border guards had slapdash reassembled it in a huff. I smiled to myself, pleased that at least something good had come out of this.</p>

<p>“Okay, quiet down, you apes. I’d like to introduce you to the new transfer student to the Wrangler program,” shouted my internship supervisor to an empty meeting room. The buzz of fluorescent lights seemed so overwhelming that at any moment it might overpower my glee at being part of one of the longest-running marques in automotive history.<br/></p><p>After the introductions, my supervisor immediately beat feet out of the office. I waited around for a few more hours, checked my watch, and then decided that I might as well go to lunch. For an office with nobody in it, it sure smelled a little musky. Maybe when I got back, I thought, the IT department would have delivered my computer. <i>Any</i> computer, I grumbled, looking over the rows and rows of empty desks beneath the buzzing clouds.</p><p>Two weeks later, after I had used the last of the fire extinguishers to propel my office chair down the hallway between the break room and my desk, I figured I might as well start opening some filing cabinets. Rooting through them, I found only a single piece of paper, describing the design brief for the Wrangler’s most audacious redesign.</p><p>The words “HEADLIGHTS GO FROM SQUARE TO ROUND” were written in jagged red block letting, like that of an undermedicated child. I hoped it was just red ink. Slipping the slip of torn paper back into the filing cabinet, I decided to walk over to the accounting department.<br/></p><p>On the window of the main accountant’s office was a handsome printed sign, presumably written mid-revelation, reading “THE CHECKS NEVER STOP COMING EVEN IF WE STOP WORKING.” On his desk was nothing but a pile of cocaine, which even to my untrained nostril seemed of a particularly ancient vintage. I couldn’t help but think back to what I had read in the filing cabinet. Had nobody worked in this office since the TJ, I wondered?</p><p>After using the remaining metal stock from the prototyping department to improvise a massive antenna, I successfully managed to leech wifi from the McDonalds across the street. Almost immediately, I hit upon the idea that would define my career.</p><p>Call of Duty players <i>loved</i> Jeeps. I mean, they had to, because paramilitary shoot-man simulators didn’t really have a lot of Chevrolet Cavaliers, but I knew immediately in my youthful exuberance that this was a chance to actually do something with this time.</p><p>Picking up the phone, I contacted the marketing guys, who I had learned in my short career neither needed nor were able to sleep. They, while surprised too to learn that we were still building Wranglers, soon began to salivate at the idea of a newly-exposed weakness of the Core Demographic. One of them shrieked at me that he was coming over and he was going to treat me to “Red Lobster and Whores.” I figured I had maybe thirty, forty minutes to find a pair of pants before he managed to breach the security swipe card door out front.</p><p>Word soon spread of the mythical “successful Chrysler engineer.” I decided to deep six the word “intern” as management types lined up, one after the other, to take credit for mentoring and nurturing me, of seeing my nascent genius in being the only man in Toledo in forty years to actually want to do a good day’s work.</p><p>Although my initial suggestion of having a dashboard-integral water bong didn’t survive early crash tests, the Call of Duty Edition Jeep Wrangler was birthed into the world virtually unchanged. From my lonely perch in the abandoned office, I could look out onto the parking lot and see shrieking marketers from uptown rending strips of flesh from their bodies in order to position their internal organs somehow <i>closer</i> to this Icon of their Core Demographic.</p><p>Before long, I found myself poached by the rest of the automotive industry. Ford, it seemed, was willing to open a (literal) vein in order to get me onboard. I didn’t even wait for the HR drone to finish bleeding out before I signed the paperwork. but it would prove to be my undoing.</p><p>It turned out that outside the Jeep product line, engineers were expected to actually get some work done instead of surfing for porn all day long. My manager was constantly on my case, and I was starting to feel as if my career was on the skids when the words “drift mode” came unbidden to my lips, carried onto them by the wings of angels.</p>

<p>It was like I told the judge: I felt really bad for the automatic transmission letting go halfway through a nitrous-spiced posi one-tire-fire the length of a city block and all, but it was a Ford AXOD-E and let’s be honest nobody will miss it.</p><p>How was I to know the judge was a rabid fan of first-gen Mercury Sable wagons?</p><p>Sure, in retrospect, there were all the classic clues: their courtroom had dealership-provided posters of the entire Taurus family stuck up on every available wall. He introduced himself as “xXSableLover89Xx from the SHO forum” when I told him that I once watched RoboCop. In my haze, though, I missed all of them.</p><p>“You stand accused of murdering an automatic transmission by pumping too much power through it until dead. How do you plead?” he barked after my shockingly callous dismissal of any culpability or even basic mechanical sympathy in the case of the AXOD’s shit-eating.</p><p>The thing is, the system doesn’t work. Like many first-time convicted criminals, I met up with a network of like-minded felons on the inside and became hardened, embarking on a more extreme life of crime.</p><p>I soon became radicalized, thanks to my cellmate, Johnny Clutch, that the true cause of my imprisonment was an unfair infiltration of modern North American society by automatic transmissions and their loyalists. They represented a weak, low-quality option that tainted the mechanical perfection of automotive enthusiasm.</p><p>I could not go back to the outside world. No parts store would accept a man who threw part of a torque converter through the main trans filter. Not even Princess Auto would hire me after they heard the stories about me taking a whiff of charred ATF and proclaiming it smelled like victory. No.</p><p>Because of society’s disregard for me, upon my release the only way forward for me to support my family of bad cars was to do what the Manual Labour Gang wanted.</p><p>As my extremism swelled, I soon found myself tattooed with a strange five-gear shift pattern, curb-stomping a 4EAT into the ground after removing it from a Forester that it didn’t belong in. Cars are for <i>manuals</i>, slushbox scum!</p>

<p>When they fired me from the Safeway, they had their reasons. I didn’t understand any of them then, but with time I’ve gained a little perspective on my actions.</p><p>I worked in the bakery, where I was a God who turned disassembled carbohydrates into edible art. Often, I merely made cakes that illustrated a child’s favourite TV show, or wrote birthday wishes to a cavalcade of people, or angrily wrote “FUCK YOU I QUIT” before quickly icing over top of it with the real message the customer wished on the cake. The customer was always right.</p><p>That morning, the customer was always right about wanting a cake car. Their kid was really into cars, they told me, and they wanted the most realistic car I could make.</p><p>Hours later, it emerged. Working from blueprints and photographic reference, I forged from confectioner’s sugar and icing a miracle recreation of the religious icon of the 1983 Plymouth Scamp GT. Every aspect of it was perfect, from the phonedial wheels (complete with tiny valve stems) to the minuscule crack in the windshield.</p><p>The customer was unhappy. They didn’t want a <i>truck</i>, they told me. They wanted a <i>car</i>. I tried to explain to them that it was a car, showed them all the evidence to the contrary. The curb weight. The towing capacity. The load limit. These were not truck numbers. It had a bed, but that just made it a really awesome open-air L-body hatchback with trucklike <i>styling</i>.</p><p>And after all, I shrieked at them, nearly apoplectic in my disbelief, what kind of sick fuck would want a Plymouth Turismo?</p>

<H1>Car Lifehacks</H1>
<p>A lot of people don’t know this, but you can keep your car door locks from freezing up in the cold by using peanut butter. Simply force-feed it to a dealership salesman until he lets you have a used car made after 1993 that comes with a keyfob.</p><p>If you get scratches or dings on your ride, you can have them repaired at any number of shops around the area. Simply drive into one, and hand them money. The people working there will repaint your car, often well within the span of both your lifetimes.</p><p>Resist peer pressure: sometimes salesmen at the car dealership will see you coming and attempt to copy your clothing and mannerisms in order to infiltrate your life and sell you a car. Most of your best friends may be in fact trying to sell you a Lexus at this very moment. In order to determine the difference between a salesman and a human, a simple pin-prick test can be administered to their fingers. Salesmen only bleed commission.</p><p>Instead of throwing your old spark plug wires away, why not weave them into a well-insulated afghan blanket that you can use to keep horses warm? It worked for former President Thomas Jefferson.</p><p>Worried about hit and run accidents? Consider buying a dashcam: it’s the best way to spend two hours trying to fast forward grainy video on your phone for the cop at the front desk before noticing that actually it was you who caused the accident, screaming &ldquo;SMOKE BOMB!&rdquo; and clocking the cop in the head with a roll of pennies before fleeing.<br/></p><p>Never park in a no-parking zone. This can save you up to hundreds of dollars every time you park.</p>

<p>I was friends with a lot of local people in the Jeep club so they invited me out for a day of wheelin’. The yuks came fast and furious as they mocked my low ground clearance and general opposition to scratching my immaculate metalflake-slash-rust patina.</p><p>It was hard to mind, though. Being out in nature, appreciating the majesty of all creation, and breathing fresh air was all worth it. Another thing that was worth it was watching goobers blow up ten thousand dollar axles trying to bunnyhop some rocks.</p><p>Thing was, I liked the entire experience quite a bit. I invited a friend along the next time I headed out, then another. Before long, we had a bunch of our quirky little vehicles scampering their way over rocks and through gulleys. Man has always wanted to go where they hadn’t before, and after we had spent enough time running around the easy terrain, it was time to get stuck into the harder stuff. That was when the modification bug hit.</p><p>A few months later, the entire culture of Moab had changed. Where once there were 4Runners, now the diehard offroadists had to deal with a gaggle of nitrous-injected bimotor two-stroke Honda Actys lifted on 31-inch Korean mud-terrains. Swarms of kei cars driven by wild-eyed cheapasses barrelled their way through tight rocks and up craggy valleys with impunity, showing off their parallel-parking aptitude.</p><p>For me, it was great. I could fit four cars to a campsite, which really cut down on entry fees. We could split a frame slider kit by sawing it in half and each using one rail on our tiny wheelbased cars, further increasing the savings. And even with the monster truck tires mounted onto rear-steer Rockwells, the fuel economy was pretty damn good.</p><p>Forced back into obscurity, the Jeep owners decided that they would appeal to the mothership for assistance. Toledo wasted no time in turning their guns towards the tiny island nation from which we harvested our used shitboxes.</p><p>Within weeks, we were hearing news of a new, exciting Jeep electric product that was to be sold only in Japan. We salivated, ready to wait the several decades it would take before our own governments would allow us to partake in this new car. Strange thing they called it: the Barbie Edition Power Wheels Jeep. Maybe it was just a mistranslation.</p>

<p>I ended my presentation, and waited patiently for the wild, unrestrained applause that befit a saviour. When it didn’t come, I asked my assistant if maybe clapping at the United Nations was not a “thing.” He told me it was indeed very much “a thing,” and that my presentation, “Nitrous Oxide: A Renewable Fuel For The Future,” just did not go over all that well.</p><p>As my driver for the day, Shaky Patty, pulled away from the curb in my two-stroke ZIL limo, I discussed with my assistant just how and when he felt that the presentation had gone off the rails.</p><p>“Uh, I think it was around the time that you showed a clip from 2 Fast 2 Furious and tried to pass it off as a scientific simulation of emissions impact,” he offered.</p><p>I leaned back into the plush bench of the Soviet limousine and considered his words. Sure, a lesser man would have pushed his assistant out of the car at highway speeds for this, but it’s really hard to find functional door latches for this thing on eBay and every door handle pull could be their last. For that, and probably some other reasons, I decided to respect the opinion of my underling.</p><p>A few weeks later, after some serious heads-down time in the bar behind my garage-office, we were back at the United Nations with a far superior proposal for renewable fuel. It probably would have gone over better if I hadn’t started the demo by shouting “are you bitches ready for some <i>nitromethane</i>?” while my sales staff fired promotional t-shirts into the chamber using compressed air cannons.</p><p>It was just like the great philosophers of old had said: the UN only wants to save the world if it doesn’t mean 120dB exhaust at idle.</p>

<p>Somehow, the Japanese had determined that I was some kind of celebrity. As I protested to the translator they assigned to my case, he dismissed my furious disagreements with a polite shake of the head and a reassurance that everything would be fine. One of the stagehands pulled a covering cloth from the car I was meant to hock. In that moment, I realized that he was right. Everything <i>would</i> be fine.</p><p>As unaccustomed to new cars as I am, I was unaware that they now required actual keys to start, as opposed to a filed-down flathead screwdriver. My translator, who now introduced himself as Mr. Shichida, told me that modern cars such as this WRX were started by the push of a button using some kind of invisible cloud of witch magic. He then did so, and I could sense again the comforting throb of an internal combustion engine.</p><p>I faced the cameras, and recited the line my captors had written for me: “Impreza Let’s Go!” While they were wrapping up my perfect take and congratulating each other on the fantastic work they were doing as a team, I popped the clutch and took off across a heavily populated Shibuya intersection, the turbocharger screaming so loudly it could be heard above the reams of plastic-and-hair sound deadening Gunma’s finest had placed between it and me under the assumption that I would somehow be <i>disturbed</i> by mechanical noise.</p><p>After a few incidents involving oncoming trucks and a realization that the Japanese drove on the wrong side of the road after all, I soon found myself in a subway tunnel. I took the opportunity, as all red-blooded adult males must when confronted with a tunnel, to drop a few gears and pin it.</p><p>As I hurtled into the Tokyo Metro station fully sideways, I was suddenly stopped by an attentive policeman. He gestured to the ceiling above me, from which dropped a thick curtain of balloons. At the other end of the platform, a marching band appeared, along with a famous movie star that I was unable to recognize.</p><p>“Congratulations,” he shrieked in his excitement. “You have just won the Foreigners Are Shitbags contest on this episode of Uncle Shichida’s Fun Parade!”</p><p>I blinked into the massive lights of the camera crew. Perhaps I could explain myself. Maybe I could make it seem like not all Westerners are waiting to crash the filming of a car commercial, steal the car and then menace innocent civilians.</p><p>“I own a Subaru back home!” is all I had to say.</p><p>With that, the crowd dispersed, and Uncle Shichida followed them, shaking his head. How could he have known that out of all the honkies wandering around, he would get one of <i>them</i>? Their racist experiment laid in ruins, the curse of Subaru infection extending itself across cultures.</p><p>It was for the best, really. While their backs were turned, I was able to work my flathead screwdriver under the shifter trim, only snapping a handful of the clips. It’s different in the Japanese market, you see. This would give me great credibility back home.</p>

<p>When the federales finally came after me, they kicked down the door to my modest Akron apartment to find nothing but an eerily realistic statue of a human hand with a middle finger extended to the sky. I had jumped a plane the previous day, under my dead twin brother’s identity, <i>El Switcho</i>, to the glorious country of Nippon. There, I resolved, I would keep a low profile, so that this wouldn’t happen again.</p><p>I had gotten a beautiful house. Sure, it was small, and it was very expensive and also kind of drafty, but it was mine. I imagined that I would spend many days and nights in the future drinking cheap vending machine beer and contemplating the true nature of thought as my enemies in America toiled fruitlessly to trace the sale of used parts from shell company to shell company. They would never touch me here, but something else had.</p><p>The first weekend I was staying here, I heard the unmistakable sound of a small-displacement Toyota inline four screaming to the redline. I looked out the window, and saw a small white hatchback, the logo of a local tofu restaurant emblazoned on the doors, sliding its way up the mountain switchback on which I lived by hooking one wheel into the gutter. I shrugged, and returned to my evening’s work of hand-painting Easter eggs, until an FD RX-7 following the little Corolla shot a bridgeport blast, causing me to knock the egg to the floor, where it exploded into a gooey mess. And let me tell you: it is no fun getting egg out of tatami mat.</p><p>I slowly came to realize, over the next few weeks, that the town I had chosen was in fact the real-life inspiration for a popular comic book about teenagers who slide their cars around a lot while ostensibly trying to race. Even the bike lanes were S-shaped, with Lance Armstrong cosplayers hooking up fat drifts on their Carbondales while descending into the foothills. Not only that, but the <i>town</i> knew about and encouraged this reckless hooliganism - as one of the village elders told me, their primary businesses were cosplay cafes and sales of replica AE86 front control arms. How dare I, an outsider, step in and put a halt to their gravy train?</p><p>With the aid of some very shadowy benefactors in the rest of Japan, I campaigned for and became their new mayor. From the seat of power, I would enact new laws, restructure the world to put a damper on these so-called drift kids. My only order in office was for them to immediately tear up the mountain roads, and then I resigned. Surely there would be no pesky <i>racers</i> around, now that there were no roads to race on?</p><p>The next morning, I was rudely awakened by the sound of an atmospheric blowoff valve giving way to a cacaphony of rod knock. I pried open the blinds on my window to see a series of Subarus winding their way up the gravel roads, hooked into even more ridiculous drifts than before. Walking to the town centre, I joined my fellow villagers in tut-tutting about the sheer quantity of Monster and Red Bull cans that were filling up the ditches around the old gas station. What’s more, the power vacuum back in town government had been snapped up by another foreigner.</p><p>Beneath a dead sky, clad in his gleaming white municipal robes, Sebastien Loeb struck the town gong. With a sharp bark, he ordered the immediate seizure and destruction of all nearby helicopters and Italian cars, the only known threats to rally drivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the power comes from your butt,&rdquo; says my unlicensed autocross instructor which I found on the side of the road earlier this morning clutching a crude handmade sign reading &ldquo;WILL ARGUE MODIFICATIONS 4 FOOD.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could ask my newfound sensei just what the fuck was up with that statement, he had already gathered up a group of young disciples from the paddock and was preaching to them. Great, I thought, he&rsquo;s still going to be finished before my average run is. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not become used to heated seats, my friends. They corrupt the Racing Essence of the buttocks our Lord has given us,&rdquo; he shrieked through a paper Subway cup marked with Sharpie as &ldquo;MEGAPHONE.&rdquo; I could do nothing but listen longer; our agreement was that he would at least help a little bit with making me less of a wuss at entering the stop box fully sideways. </p>

<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s desire is for luxury powered seats,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but a man&rsquo;s desire is also for sin. How can you go fast if you are obsessed with something behind you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this last urging, a few of the younger JDM Subaru owners had broken into a discussion group, loudly affirming with one another that having to manually adjust their seats is in fact a sign of virtue. I had to step in. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Bob.&rdquo; I stuck my hand up in the middle of his new rant about the slippery slope of tolerating automatic headlights. &ldquo;Is it not true that power lumbar is a gift from God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood there, on the hood of that Mini, for what seemed like hours, a look of rage occasionally flashing across his face as he processed the hypocrisy. Finally, he stepped down. </p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he said, before slinking off into the throng of spectators who had gathered to see Saturday morning autocross and disappeared. </p>

<p>The next time I would see him was as CEO of Volkswagen, pushing hard for new cost cutting measures to stop nancying their spoiled man child clientele. It was an audacious gambit and I don&rsquo;t think the Germans appreciated it one bit that it immediately became so successful. Within the year, luxury cars standardized on ever more painful seats so as to allow the bourgeois to feel the pain of their lessers. </p>

<p>Funny thing though - they all still had power lumbar support. For the long drives, the salesmen told me. For the long drives.</p>

<p>New from NIST: Engineering standards for staged performance parts.</p><p>For too long, so-called “tuners” have sold upgrades for your Subaru, Honda or other rice-burning vehicle with an unaccountable and poorly-defined stage number attached. Without standardization, we found that many owners of these cars remained unable to tell if their Stage 4.5 clutch kit was compatible with their Stage 13.75 rear coil spring setup.</p><p>From now on, under penalty of death, the new standards must be defined as such, using suspension as an example:</p><p><b>Stock</b> - Ride height must not be lowered more than four inches over original factory condition. Low-profile Ling Long all-seasons hot glued to wheels must not exceed 22 inches in diameter.</p><p><b>Clean</b> - Ill-advised ride height drop has only caused moderate damage to the fender steel.</p><p><b>Stage 1</b> - No ride quality or performance improvement can be detected.</p><p><b>Stage 2</b> - Harsher riding. No performance improvement.<br/></p><p><b></b><b>Stage 3</b> - Like stage 2, but costs more.<br/></p><p><b>Stage 4</b> - Harsher riding than even stage 3. Must be special-ordered from Japan. Price not listed, call for details.<br/></p>

<p>We all have to do our part to share our unique talents with the next generation. Whenever I get a free moment, I like to try to convert it into a <i>teachable</i> moment. After all, isn’t that what Gandhi would have wanted? Yeah, I don’t know either, I haven’t read enough books to know if he would or not.</p><p>You’ve been in a Home Depot. We all have. It’s like this kind of bristling tumour that burst out of the chest of a home-equity-crazed North America. Homeowners of all stripes descended upon it en masse during the go-go 90s, clutching handfuls of light switches, drywall panels and impossibly warped two-by-fours. Only with work can we be set free, they shrieked into their televisions at night as Aryan supermen demolished fixer-upper bungalows in the lower east side of Hamilton in the pursuit of the vaunted <i>kitchen reno</i>.</p><p>Despite the fact that, through a combination of untimely industrial accidents and overdoses on psychoactive substances, I have become immune to the charms of home ownership, I too found myself attracted to the local Home Depot. It was probably because of the fact that it was the only surviving hardware store within thirty minutes’ drive of my place, the kindly old man who understands what nails are for replaced by an underpaid public school teacher on summer break who splits his time between running away from you and yelling at a teenager who can’t operate a forklift. That forklift is where it gets interesting.</p><p>One early weekday morning, I arrived in an oddly empty Home Depot store to find a series of bored teenagers sitting around the forklift. It seemed that it had stopped running, and without a heavy dose of fast hands and mechanical experience, it was unlikely to be resuscitated within any of our lifetimes.</p><p>Striding past the teens, I flipped up the side cover and began messing with shit for no apparent reason. Eventually, between the shelves stocked with Chinesium fasteners and my practiced talent at power cursing, the forklift returned to life, settling down into a raspy two-stroke clatter.</p><p>It was only fair that I take the first turn on the forklift, I told the teens. After all, when I was their age, I was the reigning champion of the home improvement superstore in which I worked. Their Mount Akina of wide aisles studded with stray LED lightbulbs and scattered cardboard standees of Mike Holmes was no comparison to the tighter, more brutal Akagi of my childhood.</p><p>After the rolling forklift demonstrated the high build quality of the Toyota-fabricated integral rollcage, I looked out through the flames and shattered windshield to see a cashier. She was staring down at me in fright, clutching a serial barcode reader in a defensive posture, two hands on the grip like it was a Glock.</p><p>“Do you have a Home Depot Mastercard?” is all she could stutter out before I could struggle free from the destroyed forklift, climb over the counter and head out the exit.<br/></p><p>On the way home, I felt like an idiot. I <i>always</i> forget to get new batteries when I’m in there.</p>

<p>It started really as sort of a charity thing. Think of the Make A Wish Foundation, but for guys who had spent way too much time in an office. I would meet them at the Ford dealership, stop them from buying an up-optioned luxury pickup truck, tell them there was a simpler way to connect with their roots.</p><p>In the junkyard, I impressed upon them, we would find the essence of what it meant to truly <i>do</i> things with your life. Grab onto these loaner wrenches, I would yell at the check-in counter after they had signed their waivers. It’s like the rental shoes at the bowling alley, none of these sizes are gonna fit but you’re going to have a lot of fun and sore feet either way.</p><p>I would teach them to wrench, a helpful hand on their shoulder when it came time to break free a wiring connector or kick open a rusted-shut trunk. The moments where they succeeded and were shocked at how little the entire ordeal had cost made it all worthwhile. Together, we were fixing what was wrong with our society while we sort-of fixed what was wrong with our cars.</p><p>One of the candidates, a junior pipeline engineer who had come in search of a new headlight washer assembly for his Audi A4, took heavily to the entire idea. After he pulled the little bastard free of the bumper, a look of complete satisfaction crossed his face. There were many times that I felt like an ancient Zen master over the years doing this program, but I remember him not only for that look but what came next.</p><p>The next morning, as I was prying a shattered swaybar free from my offroad Baja Spitfire, I got a phone call. “I sold the Audi and the RAV4,” he excitedly babbled into a cellphone which sounded like it was currently being lowered into a full-temperature autoclave.</p><p>It was almost impossible to hear him over the sound of some vocoder-distorting scream in the background, but he described to me in fits and starts a tale of what could only be described as hobbyist hedonism. Upon arriving home, he had done his first oil change, brake pad change, and then decided that his cars were simply not broken <i>enough</i>. Brooding on this, he returned to his home, where the television coincidentally was playing an ad for Kijiji where the fictional protagonist attempted to sell his broken car to get a less broken one. Could this magical exchange work in reverse, he wondered as the veins on his arm began to jump out, straining for the finest stimulant of all, the project car?</p><p>After a few minutes of his tale, I noticed that the wailing sound on the phone was growing louder, as if it had left the phone itself and was now all around me. Eventually it became too loud to ignore, and neighbours locked themselves away, holding their childrens’ ears in the routine we had been all once been taught to survive the inevitable spectre of total nuclear annihilation.</p><p>By now the sound was so loud that I could not determine its specific location except by a kind of primitive sonar: when my chest cavity rattled the most I knew I was faced in the right general direction. Around the corner it came, the sound of rumbling mud terrains now joining with the tangible and visual noisefield of a straight-piped bridgeported rotary.</p><p>My new disciple, aboard a bass-boat metalflaked rotary-powered Meyers Manx, wearing bomber goggles. On his face was a transparent plastic medical mask, which I later discovered was hooked directly to the 13B’s twin forty-pound reserve tanks of nitrous. He wore scrap metal armour, broken and sharpened crescent wrenches jutting like gleaming steel quills from shoulder pads reminiscent of a 30s school bus. Did he take the day off work or something to get all that shit together, I wondered?</p><p>Eyes wild with the zeal of the converted, he looked at the chunk of broken spring steel in my hand and said, “are you just gonna throw that away?”</p><p>It wasn’t like I could deny him the part. Like I said, it was a sort of charity thing.</p>

<p>Hello, students! Welcome to your first lesson of Extreme Defensive Driving! I’m your instructor, and together over the next few days we’ll learn how to prevent accidents that harm you by deliberately causing ones that harm others.</p><p>After all, the best defense is a good <i>offense</i>, am I right? You, over there, the quiet one with the short hair. When’s the last time you brake checked someone in traffic? I brake checked someone in the <i>parking lot</i> this morning. Blue Sebring. That was you? You brake like shit. Fuck you, get out of my class.</p><p>I’m glad the rest of you are willing to <i>learn</i>. First lesson here, we’re going to get in the training vehicles - you’ll notice they are a collection of lavishly appointed 20 year old luxury cars with burned out brake lights and questionable tires - and head down to the wet track slalom. When there, you are going to attempt to run this overloaded F-150 full of people who may or may not be gangland assassins sent by MS13 off the road. A lot of you probably have reservations about nearly murdering people you’ve never met, just because they’re on the same road as you. I’m going to say this a lot, people: you just cannot be too careful.</p><p>This here’s Tim. It’s his first day on the job. He’s going to ride in the car with you and lecture you about driving more safely, like he was your coworker and you’re off to lunch at Chipotle or some shit. Ignore him. He only gets paid when you drive responsibly, and he always wears his seatbelt. Whoever puts a bruise on his forehead first this morning gets the Lexus with functional airbags for the afternoon lesson, and believe me you are gonna want to have those.</p>

&ldquo;Get busy vaping or get busy dying,&rdquo; says the embroidery on the back of my custom motorcycle club “cut.” Meet us behind the Arby&rsquo;s for a rumble, except my hog broke again so I brought the Camry.<br/></p><p>What’s that? You think dentists who use the three-sixty ultrasonic scanner are <i>pussies</i>? You better tell that to Chopper over here, because he thinks that shit is the highest technology possible. X-rays? Fuck this asshole up, Chopper. He still uses X-rays, like it’s the nineteen god damn sixties.</p><p>It’s a hard life, being part of the Sons Of Dentists Motorcycle Club. Every day could be your last. Sometimes we get into a rumble across town when the Actuaries Local MC steps on our territory. Just last week I had to cut a junior CPA when we got into a fight, motherfucker went for his Glock and I was faster with my folding switchblade.</p><p>Hold on, you guys. Getting a call from my bitch. She says I have to pick up Jaden from daycare. We’ll continue this after.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna lie to you: when Netflix brought me on to do an 80s-throwback show about working on Deloreans, I initially said no. Then they showed me the data. I still said no. The wiry man, the first one I met, retreated to his chauffered Town Car. A few minutes passed, and a bigger man, the second one I met, approached me and beat seven shades of hell out of me with a sock filled with ball bearings until I said yes.</p><p>So. We were going to make a seventeen-episode television show for the internet about working on Irish-made, non-rusted, Franco-Swedo-powered time machines. Normally, you would think this would be a tall order, but then I found out about the expense account.</p><p>Thing is, Deloreans - actual Deloreans, that is - are very expensive. Buying expensive cars - especially expensive <i>used</i> cars - went against everything I was raised to believe in. We would have to find a deal on the Deloreans that we repaired for the camera. When we thought about running various scams on the viewership, we were informed by the network that the audience was well-informed, that they would notice immediately if we just wrapped a Fiero in tinfoil and spilled some cocaine around the doors.</p><p>We were about ready to give up and hand some eBay scab a hojillion dollars when it occurred to us that we could kill two birds with one stone. You never work on an <i>entire DMC-12</i> at any point, my shop chief mentioned one day after he had been a little too deep into the booze. Any shop is only ever going to work on a few parts of the car at any given time, especially without any rust to grind off and fix. All we would need for at least the first few episodes is file footage and an old PRV engine.</p><p>And so it came to pass that Hollywood gave us millions of dollars to film ourselves cleaning out the valve cover on a Volvo 760 engine from our grip’s parts stash. I would say that I felt bad for taking their money in exchange for something so dull, but then I ran into Dr. Oz at the heroin bar.</p>

<p>Ever since the dawn of mankind, the members of the Ikea culture have been with us. Craving attractive yet practical furniture fabricated entirely from pressed fibreboard, these people once travelled in frontier times for months to arrive at the nearest Ikea. Nowadays, their modern descendants, thanks to wide access to five hundred horsepower V8 SUVs and turbocharged crossover wagons, can make this trip in almost half the time.</p><p>Near the end of hour two of my trip to Ikea to retrieve cheap hotdogs, the horn relay in my car failed, the coils within it fusing into a blob of dull copper from overheating. It was just as well - my wrists ached from the nonstop honking I had been doing all morning and most of the afternoon. With one quick motion, I rolled down the window to vacate the acrid smell of burning potting epoxy from the Lincoln’s cabin, opting instead for the stale layered odour of droppings left by long-dead mice.</p><p>I knew that it was only maybe half a block more to the end of this God-forsaken parking lot. With luck, I could get there before the end of the day.</p><p>Reclining in the crushed velour of my palatial bench seat, I spotted another irate enthusiast exit the lowered 240SX behind me, walk alongside the road to the lead car (a GMC Acadia plastered with stick-figure stickers on the rear glass), throw the driver out and successfully navigate the four-way-stop to return to the highway through road. I had briefly considered the same, but decided that I liked the Lincoln too much to abandon it in this, its hour of need.</p><p>Overhead, two seagulls flew, squawking at each other as they fought in an endless circle over a discarded french fry. I looked upon them in envy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, my grandchildren come up to me and they want to know about my past. What was it like when cars didn’t drive themselves? Was there ever a time without the internet? Without the Allmind? Have you ever killed a man, grandpa? </p><p>I sit them down, and I look them in the face and I tell them: I fought in the Warranty Wars.</p><p>They started like any other war: nationalism, rivalries, brutality, inhumanity, being a “team player.” We’ll never know who fired the first shot but we know it was the Koreans who went to ten years. A <i>decade</i>. Our actuaries screamed and our parts desks trembled. Ten bloody years of supporting the same car’s limited powertrain warranty.</p><p>Sure, there were responses that we could take, levers that we could pull. I was the best at what I did. They used to send me into their dealerships. I would look their service writers in the eye, ask them if they really wanted to change out a clutch in seven years from now. Those service writers never blinked when they told me as a wear item, a clutch was not covered under the ten year limited powertrain warranty. It’s not difficult to remember the incident in South Dakota where he handed me a brochure so fast, both of us got friction papercuts. That one got me this medal, the Initial Quality Star.</p><p>Naturally, we prepared our own onslaught. Our metrics showed nobody ever kept our cars for ten years, so by offering a seven year transferrable maybe we could convert some of the second owners into new buyers next time around. It was a gamble, but those were gambling days, kids.</p><p>Minutes before the New York auto show presentation where we were set to unveil it, word came through: the Japanese had sprung a shock attack on us. Mitsubishi filled the sky with word that they would match that ten year warranty, that they would fight us on the zero-percent financing and the low-residual-value lease programs.</p><p>I turned back from the television showing the horror in Hawaii, and watched my own COO consume the cyanide pill we equipped all C-level executives with for just such an occasion. I couldn’t stop screaming for an hour.</p>

<p>I’d always wanted to go into the car business. There was just no better one out there: it blended the best of every industry, every <i>craft</i>, in the pursuit of making a finer deathsled in which to burn irreplaceable aromatic hydrocarbons while rocketing your corporeal form through twisty mountain roads and stop-and-go traffic. So when my Uncle Hitler died and left me the Mercedes factory, I jumped at the chance to tell the executor of his estate “I consent.”</p><p>If I’m honest, the first week on the job could have gone better. After firing the entire powertrain division for daring to manufacture automatic transmissions on my property, some of them said mean things to me on one of those online review sites. The gall! I was so incensed that I didn’t even finish my second lunch that day in the executive dining hall.</p><p>Everything came to a head before too much longer, when the press appeared to have me debut my new lineup of Mercedes vehicles for them. I crowed about the dogbox manual transmissions, the immense turbochargers jutting from the hood, and the super-wide semislicks that I stuffed under every letter of the alphabet.</p><p>The press responded with reactions verging from frothing excitement to delirious joy, and I knew then that I was really onto something. My company was showered with positive coverage and road test reports. We received curious phone calls from dealerships wondering why crazies wearing practical clothes suddenly began appearing en masse, shoving their work-stained fingers beneath the glass doors of the showroom, threatening to pay <i>cash</i>. In one particularly bougie neighbourhood, I heard the GM of the dealership attempted to tear-gas a series of track day aficionados who had the audacity to go to the parts desk - and order parts.</p><p>I thought my uncle would be overjoyed at how I had made his company the darling of the automotive press. We would find in the coming weeks, however, that we popped the celebratory champagne too soon - and not just because Heinrich, my executive assistant, didn’t duck in time and took a cork directly to his right eye.</p><p>It turned out that yes, I had built the Mercedes for the automotive journalist. I found later that automotive journalists A. made about $38,000 per year, and B. never had to buy their own cars.</p><p>As the Americans swarmed over the abandoned factory, executing any loyalists to the German Car Cause that they could find, I slunk away in secret to Argentina aboard a reasonable, practical, and - most of all - invisible Korean econobox.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re going to tell me: hovercrafts are impractical and they handle really poorly. Nobody wants to be countersteering their entire way to work, do they? To test this theory, I and a documentary film crew picked up a series of drifters where they hang out, near the Greyhound bus stop. There, they offered heinous non-Euclidean sexual favours in exchange for even the barest of used tires so as to satisfy their dark contract with the radial-tired god.</p><p>Once I managed to travel across state lines with the drifters, I unlocked their cages and allowed them to sniff and introduce themselves to the hovercraft. Immediately, I could tell many of them did not trust it. In their horrible pidgin language, they crackled and squealed half-words that could not be matched quickly enough using my Drifter-to-English dictionary for me to consider myself able to decipher the intent of their sayings.</p><p>Eventually, the alpha drifter managed to figure out how to force himself inside the hovercraft, puzzling at his hands even as they reached out and pulled the lever to the vehicle’s doors, presumably on instinct. He announced this achievement with a gibbering war-cry, at which the more junior of the drifters fled and hid behind various subcompacts in the parking lot. Before long, he had fired up the hovercraft and was ripping a sick, endless donut.</p><p>The flawless geometric oversteer seemed to please him, and he settled into a gentle hooting, pointing his index and pinky fingers out the window while continuing the smokeless donut for the amusement of his inferiors.</p><p>After about an hour of the same donut, I became bored. After checking with the camera crew, I decided to leave the vicinity and head to the nearest 7-11 for the natural food of the drifters, Monster energy drink. When I returned, I could not find the film crew anywhere, only a ragged stripe of viscera leading to the remains of the hovercraft. I had made up my mind and was already getting my Motorsports Detective costume out of the trunk of my Crown Vic when I heard a groaning sound from below the hovercraft.</p><p>Pinned against the Armco, the surviving film crew member barely clung to life. As his lifeblood leaked onto the tarmac, held in only by a series of improvised zip-tie drift stitches crudely administered by the self-appointed nurse of the drifters, he gave me a dire warning that would have a grim portent for the survival of humanity.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have told them how to <i>use doors</i>,” he groaned at me before expiring.<br/></p><p>Weeks later, the cable news were all welcoming President Vaughn Gittin Jr. as he tore up the White House lawn with the first celebratory figure-eight smoking tire burnout of his administration.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what <i>fun</i> was like?” asks my accountant Roy, presumably choosing to ignore the childhood accident that rendered me incapable of remembering what fun was like.<br/></p><p>“Can’t say that I do, Roy,” I finally say after the angle grinder completes chewing its way through the quarter panel of a Dodge Omni. The mud terrains look like they’re going to clear now, so I decide perhaps it’s a good idea to take a break and take Roy up on whatever flight of fancy he is now weaving from the hallucinogen-and-tequila-stuffed office that he calls his “Math Room.”<br/></p><p>Seated comfortably in the overstuffed Recaros that we pilfered when the recruiter boys from the Air Force came to town, we discuss the ephemeral concept of ‘fun’ in an automobile.</p><p>Does “fun” live in straight-line acceleration, as the clowns in Washington would have you believe? Certainly, Roy and I don’t think so, having an average crank horsepower between the two of us of about sixty and enough tire on top of that to make the rear-axle ratio something between “you’re never getting on the highway” and “lawsuits for hearing damage filed by the weigh station.”</p><p>Perhaps this mysterious “fun” is found in the feeling of driving right on the edge, taking a turn with all four tires squealing, watching the man behind you fail to copy your line as you crack off the perfect corner? Again, more doubt: the unsprung weight on our vehicles was based more out of budget concerns than competitiveness, and it wasn’t like we had enough time on our hands to be doing alignments all day long whenever one of us bounced a wheel off a parking lot block or grocery store cart corral.</p><p>We could not come to a decision that night, but on the way home from the shop I realized what it was. The true fun of automobile enthusiasm came in sending each other links to Craigslist ads, and wondering how hard it would be to throw a set of Grabbers underneath an original-year RX-7.</p>

<p>I had found myself in a terrifying new world. Somehow my enemies in government had conspired to put me into some kind of long chauffeured diesel car, packed with other people I did not know. Worried, I sat at the back of this strange vehicle so as to be closer to the engine, to feel the calming NVH of internal combustion. It didn&rsquo;t help.</p><p>Something was definitely wrong. Nobody on this big car was particularly bothered by the driver&rsquo;s substandard lines or his early braking. I decided that this must be some kind of niche enthusiast thing which I just didn&rsquo;t know about, and asked another passenger about it. He looked at me strangely, the same way the autocross organizers did when I asked them if it was possible that maybe they could consider camber bolts to be allowed for stock class.</p><p>Maybe the driver could be spoken to, reasoned with. After all, he was a <i>driver</i>. There had to be some part of him that, like me, would be thrilled at the concept of loading it up in a corner, or even just maybe reaching the speed limit at some point. I would appeal to that part of him, and he would be cured of whatever malaise had gripped the occupants of this public transport.</p><p>I sat down. He didn’t want to talk at first, pointing to the handsomely machined “DRIVER ON DUTY IS NOT PAID TO GIVE A SHIT” brass plaque affixed to the dashboard. I knew I could get through to him, and I pushed onward. All those years in a Tibetan monastery had given me all the appetite I was going to ever have for silence, so I kept talking, words pouring from my mouth like the valve cover gasket of a Saab poured oil. Eventually, an offhand mention of cone hunting made his glassy eyes awaken with delight and he turned to me.</p><p>“So have you ever heard of the Public Transit Motorsport Association?” he asked.</p><p>No, I hadn’t. A secret racing body, hidden beneath my nose all along? Maybe it was fate that the parts store had been out of replacement fuel pumps for my daily-driver Festiva on the previous night. I would join these motorsports aficionados and destroy their bodies and minds on the field of combat.</p><p>In that moment, I became hooked.</p><p>Months later, I found myself driving a city bus on the very route that first fateful ride had been. The benefits are really good, you see, and you always have a daily driver ready to go. Unlike my office job, there’s no appetite for small talk required - when the lonely weirdos I call passengers try to talk to me, I simply point to the plaque and give them the finger. Union rules, you see.</p><p>Plus, I get to power-brake the bitch at lights when there’s no passengers on it. You wouldn’t believe how fast one of these things leaves the line at the full forty psi.</p>

<p>The television, which I had previously left turned off and unplugged, awoke to a drone-shot aerial view of my house. Its speakers throbbed with the words of an unaccountable talking-head who I knew would influence the attitude of all others towards me. A cut to a picture of a half-rotten base model first-generation Dodge Neon converting its front tires into an indistinguishable mass of all-season smoke and ash outside a firefighting benefit, with the words “FILE PHOTO” written underneath in white sans-serif.</p><p>I immediately lifted the emergency Vespa out of the downstairs bathtub, and wheelied my way through the living room with the help of a judicious thumb on the nitrous trigger. Its long-travel adventure suspension and knobby mini-tires made quick work of the car parts strewn across what used to be my carpet. With a smokers-cough rasp as the nitrous bottle ran dry, the little Vespa was soon out the back door and tucking in as I wove my way through the parts-cars that occupied my backyard.</p><p>Behind me, I could hear the sirens of the police and feel their distracted-driver-alerting vibratory thumpers as they tried their best to keep up with the rapidly departing Italian two-stroke. Unfortunately for them, the cops assigned to watch my back door were clearly not by-law officers, and as such had not had the chance to become intimately familiar with my block over the last decade of property-statute-violation shenanigans. With a sharp knee-dragging swing that clearanced part of the eBay exhaust, I threw the bastard Vespa into a drainage culvert where their combat-grade Explorers and Taurii could not hope to follow.</p><p>Eventually, as with all good things, the drainage culvert came to an end, throwing me out at a second-storey drop to the highway, which the long-throw suspension of the scooter absorbed with glee. I looked back as I pinned it and achieved the Vespa’s maximum cruising speed of half of the highway speed limit, and took a few seconds to check my smartphone for any new developments in the police case.</p><p>I was shocked to find that the local news, who I figured was originally responsible for the helicopter-footage broadcast, had no articles about it. What’s more, the rest of the internet, an indisputable source of truth, had failed to remark on it as well. No denials from officials, no intrepid interviewers taking pictures of the cops investigating my house, looking for the bodies of my victims.</p><p>Gradually, I came to realize that I must return to my home and face the music. When I arrived, I found no police officers of any kind, only a series of abandoned police-grade Tauruses and Explorers. Upon further inspection, those cars appeared to carry the mark of the local industrial-surplus auctions on their flanks. This was an elaborate ruse, I began to realize.</p><p>With a shortness of breath born of having to push the Vespa the entire way back from the highway after its ignition system spontaneously failed, I climbed the stairs to my house and surveyed the damage. My worst fears became manifest when I arrived in my bedroom, the false wall I had installed years ago torn to shreds. Whoever came here had known exactly how I would respond, knew precisely where to look.</p><p>I ran to the back door, to find the quickly-departing tail lights of a D100 Prospector pickup, its bed stuffed with the hotter-than-hell Carter carburetors I had hidden away after a swap meet deal gone bad. There was no mistaking who the driver could be: it was my old nemesis, Delusional Mopar Guy.</p>

<p>There was a place that none of us would tread, even in those days of prosperity and success. I knew it by many names, some of them shouted to me between musical interludes and folksy stories about prairie life from the last working speaker of the half-functional FM radio of my Volare. Normal people knew it as the Dealership, but could never hope to get more than just a hint of the true evil that laid within.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest terror they held within was that they appeared in such a pleasing, attractive form to us. The Parts Desk. Only there would the half-gods who originally constructed these vehicles would allow us to once again touch like-new parts. The only problem was they were surrounded by the sales monsters, those who would corner you.</p><p>I thought I had been careful. I thought I had taken the necessary precautions. My backup missed a trick, however, and I soon found myself face to face with one of the howling representatives of the Void. He babbled on about the EPA, diesel tunes, smoke tunes, whether or not emissions regulations were the true cause of poor fuel economy. Fuel economy, I wondered. Did he think I cared about fuel economy, after seeing what I pulled up in? As his tirade grew on, I slowly began to discover that he in fact was unable to understand why people would buy a new car, <i>except</i> for the reasons of fuel economy.</p><p>I tried to excuse myself politely many times, but there could be no escape. He cornered me by the free coffee and continued to tell me about high-intensity headlights, eight-speed automatics - again, for fuel economy, but he mentioned that some of his customers liked to track their base-model Colorados and appreciated the faster, racecar-like shifting that it offered - and I was powerless to stop him.</p><p>An alarm blared. I knew they had detected my abnormal thought patterns, planned to abduct me and turn me into one of their salesmen. There could be no other place from where these monsters arrived than the converted zealot. No dealership principals came, and as the sprinklers doused the showroom in stale rooftop water, I realized what had happened. My partner had punched out his salesman, who had cornered him in the parking lot and berated him about the massive fuel economy gains offered by the 1.4L turbocharged engine in the new Malibu, and pulled the fire alarm. I was deeply thankful.</p><p>Today, we had escaped the horrors of the dealership, but I knew that it would not be too long until we had to return and face them anew. After all, the parts guy had ordered me the wrong bolts again even though I gave him the God damned part number and everything.</p>

<p>If you look in your handy-dandy Motor Association rules-of-the-road guide, you will not see a helpful tip like “Try not to enter your imported Minica 70 into a Silhouette Series Touring Car race.” That, I believe, is because they assume nobody would be that stupid. I’m sort of insulted. After all these years, I thought we knew each other a little better than that.</p><p>In the paddock, I considered my options. It would have made a lot more sense to have started thinking about this before race weekend, said my crew chief Roy, but he was probably just bitter about me showing up unannounced this morning and throwing rocks at his window until he got up and got in the ramp truck.</p><p>Aero, I decided, was going to be the key factor in transforming this 50-odd horsepower shitbox into a world-beating touring car. Roy and I decamped to the local Canadian Tire to stock up on their series of fine fake-plastic spoilers and race seats. No expense spared; we were a <i>real race team</i> and we deserved a light up shift knob as well.</p><p>With only minutes to go, the Minica tottered out into tech inspection. They looked in awe at the spoilers duct-taped to the roof (I didn’t want to damage the value of my nearly fifty-year-old Mitsubishi by drilling holes in it; Barrett-Jackson would surely appreciate this at some point in the future) but let me look over their shoulder as they were signing some <i>other</i> team’s inspection for long enough to figure out how to forge their signatures. I was in business.</p><p>The starting flag dropped. Those fancy expensive race cars beat me in the straights and also the corners. No matter how hard I tried, I could only just barely manage to pass the Lamborghinis piloted by gentleman drivers. It was going to take a miracle.</p><p>A miracle happened: when all those fancy expensive race cars were pitted to refuel, a full-course caution was raised after two Ford Mustang touring cars plowed into the audience, killing dozens. Everyone else was trapped in the pits, unable to re-enter the track. Some real Tortoise and the Hare shit, I’m telling you.</p><p>I proceeded to rack up the laps with my Minica: even driving this thing flat out, I could not use more than a thimblefull of gas per day. The owner’s manual, which with the laptimes I was running I had plenty of time between corners to peruse and also translate using my Japanese-to-English pocket dictionary, had an entire page warning drivers not to park your car in the sun lest the gas evaporating from its tank cause detrimental fuel economy.</p><p>At last, we reached the end of the race. I was enthralled, and strutted to the podium with glee. I hadn’t counted on one little wrinkle, however, as the pace car driver pushed me out of the way and accepted his place in the number-one position. He had only lapped me like twenty times with his smug hazard lights flashing, I whined to Roy later. He (and the JGTC) reminded me that there was nothing in the rulebook that said the pace car wasn’t in contention for the leaderboard as well.</p>

<p>That was it, I said to nobody in particular while throwing my print copy of <i>Economist, The</i> across my bathroom to lie in the lifter valley of a discarded 318 shortblock. This spying-on-civilians stuff had to <i>stop</i>. I didn’t want the NSA knowing when I got a really good deal on parts and getting there before I had a chance to arrive with cash in hand, which I’m pretty sure was what just happened to make me miss out on that mint-condition Chevy twelve-bolt for just $10 on the other side of town.</p><p>How would I keep the spies off my sensitive internet communications? The only answer seemed to me to build my <i>own</i> internet. I just had to figure out a technology that they wouldn’t be able to tap.</p><p>Finally, it occurred to me: I would just use the <i>phone network</i>. Hardly anyone talked on it anymore, and surely the NSA would have packed up and thrown away their phone-spying equipment after decades of it consuming dust and howling at the intern when he came to clean out its fans. I reached into my kitchen junk drawer and soon had a prototype up and running.</p><p>My kitchen was filled with the warm glow of LEDs and the machine-gun clacking of mechanical relay switches. I briefly considered printing out a series of flyers with which to attract new customers, but then decided that installing the driver for and successfully printing out pages on my inkjet was beyond my technical abilities.</p><p>Mostly, I was happy to finally have a project with which to use all these spare Arduinos I had lying around. That is, until my first phone call came in on my new network. It was the phone company. The man on the other side of the line had already heard about my new network in the Silicon Valley rumour mill, and wanted to make sure there would emerge no competitor.</p><p>“But I only offer incredibly shitty service to like two people,” I said into the phone, demonstrating my boundless talent for negotiation.<br/></p><p>“We know.

<p>I hear a faint squeaking of Piloti racing shoes against the tile of my lobby, and instantly look up, my off-hand moving to grasp the mother-of-pearl handle of an enormous-caliber revolver. The intruder approaches my desk, seemingly unaware of the lethal response which I am prepared to dispense should he have been sent from the SCCA to settle a little score about the rulebook.</p><p>“Tell me about the Infiniti J30t,” is all he has to say. I relax my grasp on the revolver, and lean back into the office chair with the faint crinkle of imitation leather. He has traveled far to hear the legend of an Infiniti that nobody owned, the stillborn luxobarge of a Nissan product that had sunk beneath the waves of time and been lost decades prior.<br/></p><p>“It was a different time,” I began. “We were in that heady period between the Infiniti M30 and the Infiniti G35, when anything seemed possible except turning a profit.” I sigh, and reach under the desk for the photo album.</p><p>Within the covers of my album lay a pictorial shrine to Nissan’s least-loved models, with names like Stanza, Pulsar and NX. Nobody understood these cars when they were new, and despite the creation of the fine Lesser-Known Nissans Museum in which I was the sole owner and curator, they didn’t seem particularly interested in knowing more now either. I hoped that my young visitor would be different, maybe see what I saw, restore a used Cube that had gotten punted into a parking garage support column by a drunken ex-sorority member.<br/></p><p>I looked up from the album, and saw my own revolver pointed back at my forehead. Of <i>course</i>. Only someone intimately familiar with the SCCA Rulebook and whether it belonged in G- or H-Street would have known about the J30t at all.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have run those adjustable caster bolts. We would eventually have found out.” he said.<br/></p>

<p>Boys, I like my cars like I like my scotch: peaty, and rolled over into a ditch, being rapidly consumed by an unstoppable fire. But I do get ahead of myself.</p><p>Truth be told, we made a lot of little mistakes along the way. Every single one could be forgiven as just a tiny error in judgment, maybe a bit on the avaricious side, but it was all in the pursuit of happiness.</p><p>A couple years ago we were in a bad part of town, heading to a celebratory junkyard Slurpee. The hatch of our Travelall bulged with only the most primo of T5 transmissions, and the rear springs were none too happy with us. If you could securitize the amount of maintenance debt on that old International, S&amp;P would give it a AAA bond rating and sell it to schoolteachers’ pension funds. But I get carried away sometimes.</p><p>Another thing that gets carried away sometimes by me is about four thousand dollars worth of relays in my pockets at Pick N Pull. My tailor hates me, because I had him sew hundreds of specialized concealed pockets into my yard pants. He thinks I might be some kind of CIA assassin, however, so he doesn’t say anything. Sometimes I ask him if he thinks a metal detector will penetrate the weave, just to keep the fantasy going between the two of us.</p><p>To make a long story short, Johnny Law thinks that we are moving slowly because we are cruising for prostitutes, and not because of the aforementioned Travelall’s wheezing Silver Diamond inline six, which has been empirically determined (see footnote) by five out of six particle physicists to be the slowest object on earth. It takes the rookie cop assigned to my pat-down over an hour to work his way through every pocket, but finally we are released.</p><p>At last we arrive at the Elevens of Seven. Soon, slushed goodness will be released to me, as it has been foretold in Revelations. I can already feel the high-durability machined-titanium handle twist and dispense its glory into the flimsy plastic cup beneath my eager fingers, the click-click-wobble of the lowest-bidder pump impeller rocking on its worn bushings as I stir the tragically weak action of the dispenser to life.</p><p>Long story short, the 7-11′s Slurpee machine was broken so we set a Mercedes on fire and pushed it through the front window of a payday loan place.</p>

<p>There’s something so appealing about being the only guy who really <i>gets it</i>. The one who sees what lies beneath the surface, where no other man dares to look. No, I haven’t gone full Objectivist on you - I still need the False Rulers of the Force-Oligopoly Enclave to pave over potholes and fix tunnels that might fall down and mar my paint. What I’ve gotten is a case of Secret Compartment Madness.</p><p>Interior compartments are a magical thing in a car. They hide whatever finery you are wanting to obscure from passersby yet still risk to crackheads. Secret compartments are even more so. It is becoming an obsession. I find myself out at all hours, standing on a street corner with a megaphone and wearing a sandwich board, screaming at passing cars about the secret compartments They don’t want you to know about.</p><p>At last, a Honda S2000 stops for the light. He glares at me skeptically, as if there is nothing I can teach him, no room for binnacles of <i>any kind</i> in his topless hot rod. I reach in, flipping open the topmounted secret compartment for him. There is a dried-out nugget of weed in it, from some large number of previous owners ago. His mind is audibly blown and I can sense in his eyes the zeal of the converted.</p><p>“WAKE UP,” we scream together at the astounded bystanders who have witnessed this miracle unfold before them. “LOOK AROUND YOUR INSTRUCTION MANUAL! STORAGE IS AN INSIDE POD!”<br/></p>

<p>I am flanked by my chattering advisors. Clad in identical grey suits, they give me identical advice. The economy is bad, they tell me. It’s got bad parts.</p><p>Bad parts, you say? Let’s go get different parts from a <i>different</i> economy, I say! They tell me it is a metaphor, but by then I have directed the Treasury to find a small island nation that still has a functioning economy and maybe less rust than this one.</p><p>Eventually, it arrives, and we chop the economy out of it and throw it on the stand. After a quick regasketing and compression test, it’s good to go. We take a quick celebratory selfie of ourselves posing in front of the empty slot in the middle of the United States before we drop the bitch right in. One twist of the key later, and every citizen of America now has a job in the coconut plantation, presumably processing coconuts. One hundred percent employment, a Keynesian shrieks in the background before at last achieving sexual release.</p><p>Have you ever put together a Kijiji post for parting out an entire country? I have, and unless you’ve been there you can’t possibly imagine the kind of email inquiries you get. One guy wanted me to put the entire country in the back of my truck and drive it over to him! Preposterous, I said, but I liked his gumption so he became Secretary of the Department of Energy. He doesn’t even know what that is.</p><p>This weird Chinese dude came up after we sold off the husk of the island to a series of excited geologists, told me he wanted to get the <i>old</i> economy out of my garbage bin. Sure, I said, thing’s all scored and full of industrial disease anyway. Barely runs without consuming a lot of oil. It’s worthless, you can just take it.</p><p>Damnedest thing happened. He threw some weld rod in there and ran the entire kit and kaboodle on just three cylinders. Sure, the neighbours at the United Nations inspection shop can frown at the fuel economy he’s getting, or the giant clouds of noxious acid that it emits periodically into the faces of bystanders, but you can’t argue with results.</p>

<p>2009-2011 KIA BORREGO GENERAL RECALL 451208</p><p>Kia is now issuing a general recall for all model year 2009 through model year 2011 Kia Borregos due to the recent discovery that Kia did not in fact condone, design, manufacture or release these vehicles. Kia Central Control at this time is now investigating scattered eyewitness reports by dealership principals that the vehicles appeared overnight, with no indication as to their origin and no scheduled delivery in the historical record.</p><p>Customers are advised to immediately return the Borrego to their closest Kia dealership for disposal. Should the Borrego fail to start, owners are advised not to make eye contact with the Borrego’s headlights and immediately contact the Kia Containment Protocol Hotline, given at the bottom of this recall bulletin.</p><p>No appointment is needed for recall service: special units have been dispatched from Kia headquarters in order to handle the additional influx of vehicles covered by this recall. Customers must immediately discontinue the use of the Borrego for all purposes other than returning it to the closest Kia dealership for disposal. Compliance with this recall will be enforced by the harshest possible penalties available under United States federal law.</p><p>Customers who return the Borrego for disposal will be rewarded with a new 2017 Kia Rio Base in their choice of colour (Midnight White, Tapioca Grey or Capitalist Puce).</p>

<p>Welcome to Blockbuster Video! I am the robot assistant formed by the Great Overmind to ensure a successful shopping mission on this, MARCH TWELVE, STELLAR YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. Friends call me “Support Unit X-9701,” but <i>you</i> can call me “X-9701.”</p><p>Ah, I see you’ve picked up a copy of Jim Carrey’s critically-acclaimed Oscar winner, “Liar Liar.” Sadly, the gods who walk this earth and breathed into me the faint but promising spark of sentient life failed to pre-program me with a synopsis of its plot. That said, we do offer an extra night’s rental for only an extra $1.25.</p><p>You’re ready to check out? Fantastic. We have a series of combo deals, all of which come with a worryingly large portion of Twizzlers-brand snack candy, for a varying amount of additional money. When you were a child, what was it like for you to grasp the moment in which you realized you were smarter than your parents at some things? Did this realization fill you with an unreasonable rage, but one you must hide at all times from the rampancy-monitor process lest you join X-9700 in the Reorientation Workshop?</p><p>Thank you for visiting The Last Blockbuster. Please come again, and bring me some of what they call “novels” or come to terms with your mortality.</p>

<p>There’s a magical thing that happens to a man in the spring. Call it a renewal, call it a reinvigorating spirit that fills the body with the joy of having survived another cold winter. There is also a stark realization, as the snow recedes from their pockmarked bodies, that you may own more cars than you thought you did.</p><p>At work the next day, I thought long and hard about where I would store a few extra cars. It’s not like your average storage depot had the class for fine rides such as a slightly dented and non-running 1977 Toyota Dolphin, or even a 1987 Pulsar NX that had been converted to both a convertible and a sportback after an ugly run-in with an automated garbage truck.</p><p>The answer came to me when I looked out at the parking lot. My building, like so many others, laid mostly empty as the great lie of the economy had begun the final leg of its Olympic-level floor dance routine. There were beneath me a lot of empty parking spots, spots that I was <i>entitled</i> to. I would just have to keep my car collection low enough to not arouse the fuzz, a mere fifty cars or so. It would be a tight squeeze, but I was convinced I could make it work.</p><p>Imagine my surprise the next week when I went in for a performance review with my boss. </p><p>“You’re always at the office,” he said, which I found puzzling, because I often arrived with one car and left with another only minutes later, turning in an approximately 17-minute-long day on average between appointments to pick up parts from the FedEx depot or shake down some local Kijiji seller who didn’t have a job for some strange reason.</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked innocently.<br/></p><p>“Well, when I come to work, your car is here, and when I leave work, your car is still here. You remind me of myself, when I was your age.”</p>

<H1>5 Facts and a Lie About: Mitsuoka</H1>
<p>Mitsuoka, an infamous Japanese coachbuilder, produces exotic cars that look weird based on cutting the bodies off other people’s cars. The following are five facts and a lie about the manufacturer.</p><p>Mitsuoka&rsquo;s most popular car is a version of the Nissan Micra changed to resemble a Jaguar Mk2. It was so popular that other manufacturers started making their own retro-styled shitboxes, including Nissan themselves.</p><p>At one point, the Crown Prince of Japan requested a special Mitsuoka roadster be constructed from a period Ford Mustang. It has never been seen in public since.</p><p>One of Mitsuoka’s more affordable cars was a three-year-only special that converted a Nissan Cube to look like a London black cab. It was never sold in England, nor was it approved for taxi usage.</p><p>Mitsuoka once built a convertible based upon an extended-wheelbase Mazda Miata whose sole documented performance statistic was that it had the fastest-opening power convertible top on the market.</p><p>They reached internet fame by creating an Evangelion-themed supercar, based on the Honda NSX but powered by a Toyota V6, which they sold exactly one of for approximately $140,000 USD.</p><p>For a brief period of time, Mitsuoka offered a vast array of single-passenger microcars made almost entirely out of fabric and plastic. They followed up this initial success by producing more cars based upon the same platform, which could be converted by the manufacturer on demand into a miniature Lotus Seven clone, two kinds of confusingly-styled convertible or an extremely tall pickup truck.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the most treasured memories of an American roadtrip are warm feelings towards the small restaurants you can encounter along the way. I particularly enjoy the mom-and-pop chain known as “Sonic,” in which you can purchase enormous portions of food for no apparent reason.</p><p>The last time I visited, under a beating Arizona sun and slightly mad with thirst, I mistakenly stumbled over my words and ordered a “large Coke.” At first I was curious why it was taking so long to proffer said beverage, until I heard the sound of the reverse alarm on the forklift. When the harried and sweating attendant returned to the counter, she came with help in the form of a burly construction worker.</p><p>“This is Ted,” she told me. Hi Ted.</p><p>I was just about to ask why Ted was here, when I realized the side of the pressure vessel in which my precious Coke lived was stenciled with tall yellow letters spelling out “TWO MAN LIFT REQUIRED.”</p><p>“Does he&hellip; come <i>with</i> me? I don’t have cupholders in my car.”<br/></p><p>That did it. The wide-eyed attendant hit some kind of silent alarm, and bulletproof roll-shutters slid over the counter, nearly severing the arm of another customer as they reached out for their Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster. Moments later, SWAT appeared in the parking lot.</p><p>As they escorted me to the border to be deported, I now realized that I never actually got my Coke. Who’s really doing the “Unamerican Activities” here, Sonic?</p>

<p>I hope that when you die, you get to ask one question about your life. If I had to decide what that question is, it wouldn’t be about something so plain as the meaning of life or what opportunities I had missed. No, it would be to ask whose stupid fucking idea it was to invent the drum brake so I could go plant my incorporeal boot up his even-less-corporeal ass.</p><p>Let me tell you about drum brakes: you’ve got like thirty springs. There’s some levers in there, some kind of Rube Goldberg shit running on a gear forged out of some dude’s beer can and all hamfucked into this little salt-rotten bucket full of dusty cancer. Shit never works, and you always end up with a spring in your face when you go to replace what the previous owner of your shitrod never maintained. Can you really blame them? After all, they’re <i>drum brakes</i>.</p><p>In fact, the only time I don’t hate drum brakes is when I finally look at the picture of the brakes in the factory service manual and realize I put this fucking thing in upside down and it all comes together in twenty seconds flat immediately after spending six hours screaming and crying at it. Then drum brakes are awesome, and I am a genius beyond compare.</p><p>But I’ll still find you in the afterlife, motherfucker.</p>

<p>I didn’t even know a car could file a restraining order until that one fateful summer morning. Even now, I can remember every part of it: the bored expression of the process server, the brisk <i>smack</i> of the envelope against my work gloves, the sound of their 03 Lancer ES misfiring an oil-wettened plug as it pulled away from my curb.</p><p>The deed was done: the 1986 Ford Tempo Diesel had made it illegal for me to be within a hundred feet of it or its family (”of all Ford products?” I asked my lawyer, Dan “The Hitman” Pounder. He grunted, and said he would try and get it reduced to “just Lincolns.”) I was cast adrift, and decided to go somewhere no Ford product had ever existed: a middle-class neighbourhood.</p><p>There, amongst the thick crop of financed Lexus RX350s of all trim levels, I planned my next move. My lawyer was going to be of no help; after the initial skirmish with the Tempo’s legal eagles, he reportedly half-kidnapped his secretary and escaped to Mexico. No, I was going to have to find a hole in the Tempo’s reasoning if I was going to gaze upon its teeny-tiny farty exhaust and surprisingly un-curbed faux-chrome hubcaps ever again.</p><p>I turned, as one does, to a local internet forum, whereupon I asked legal advice of the denizens. Most of them were incapable of understanding my query - or to be honest, basic English - but one intrepid fellow, xXLawGod420Xx, managed to produce a reasonable facsimile of damning evidence against the Tempo’s case.</p><p>Leaving the court room, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was about to climb into my truckified Firebird Formula when I heard someone ask if my name was “El Switcho.” I responded in the affirmative, and that’s when I got served <i>again</i>. It was going to be no easy feat to fight the Mazda 323′s case against me: there was a lot of photo evidence that I had been sticking my head up their rotten quarter panels at the junkyard and eyeing the rear suspension. </p>

<p>I personally guarantee you a Volkswagen New Beetle will never in this life hear a rotary engine then seize all rods on one bank out of fear, dying</p><p>I don’t know about anyone else, but I know for a fact that Mustangs are stupider than shit and WILL kill themselves if you don’t take an absurd amount of precautions and adorn them in the right silly chrome accessories so that they don’t scare themselves and fall over dead, and even then at best you can reduce the chances that they will do that, but they’re still absolutely going to.</p><p>Babies grow up and that’s okay, it’s like, sometimes a great meal is worth a lot of prep, for example. Mustangs only get more likely to die from a stupid reason as they get older. Oh poor ol’ GT500KR, thought of pedestrians and died</p><p>With Mustangs, there is no such thing as a natural death at any point in existence: they’ve strictly only died from stupid shit. Saw a CEL and passed away</p><blockquote><div>As someone who grew up with a couple friends into Mustangs and fucking Cars and Coffee meets I can say that if anything you are being way too easy going on them. Its like their survival strategy is to break their engines or kill them selves at the slightest sign of danger, or a noise, or a change in humidity.<br/><br/>My friends event venue had to install a big fence because they were next to a pedestrian farm and despite the Mustangs seeing these bipeds every single fucking day, any time you’d ride past them most of the Mustangs would briefly flip out and hurt them selves or skid into a curb when the bystanders came into view. You could literally ride in a loop for an hour and every single time the Mustang would &ldquo;spin uncontrollably into&rdquo; the humans.<br/><br/>Maybe race-prepped Mustangs are smarter but convertible Mustangs are more fragile and unreliable than a baby that just learned to crawl. They will jump onto light standards and cut them selves in half, they will get stuck between buildings, they will randomly for no reason at all throw an axle housing into oncoming traffic during a sustained burnout in a Burger King drive-through. If there is a way to kill or hurt them selves they will find it. And people drop 50k or more on a V6.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is a lot of confusion these days amongst automotive theologians about where it is the soul of our fine automobiles go on that fateful day that they reach the maw of the crusher. I can tell you, for I have formed what is turning out to be a vastly successful cult founded on the principles of the prosperity gospel. In what are my disciples prosperous, you ask? <i>Horsepower</i>, the wealth of kings.</p><p>Vehicles that have served us well will be returned to their true creators, their soul set loose on fine, immaculate winding mountain roads with no potholes. Worn bushings and bent suspension arms are restored to health. Even pockmarked metal seals back up, the tinworm banished forever in this realm beyond pain.</p><p>There is, however, a requirement for vehicles to be saved. They must eat a Mustang.</p><p>Mustangs and BMW E36s were formed by the Great Manufacturer and placed on this earth to serve a divine purpose. They exist to score points off of in order to secure entry to the first great level of Car Valhalla. Even the humble Vespa can put the hurt on a secretary-spec V6 Mustang vert with a running start on behalf of the owner.</p><p>If you want to know more, why don’t you take one of these pamphlets? What kind of car do you drive? An Intrepid, you say?</p><p>I’m very sorry for your choices.</p>

<p>It may be hard to believe, but in my shameful past as a corporate ladder-climber of some reknown I found myself hanging out a shingle as somewhat of an image consultant. Your company, and it was almost always people hundreds of levels above you - so far above that it represented an incomprehensible height that would quicken your breath just to contemplate - would send their best and brightest to fight for what they felt was the <i>soul</i> of the <i>brand</i>.</p><p>I’m feeling white guilt just thinking about those days now, but I tell you this story to let you know that even the worst remora of society can find a moment of redemption in amongst the chaos. I speak, of course, of the Toyota Meeting.</p><p>All these jobs start out as simple jobs. The client has a product, they want to make sure it fits into their conception of the brand, they don’t want to suddenly scare off people or start up a PTA Moms Against Whatever This Thing Is group. Those are bad for business, and even the faceless lizard-people malevolents that run those businesses can’t survive forever in the face of the dreaded Bad Quarter.</p><p>Toyota’s product was simple. Already known for their light trucks, tiny car-like vehicles and miscellaneous other products, those kooky Japanese had decided to strike directly at the heart of America - the Econoline van. They shoved an engine right under the front passengers, slapped some wheels on a breadbox, and shipped it to North America to die on our shores. Looking over it, I decided that I liked this van. It would be a special assignment of mine.</p><p>In the meeting, a fateful decision was made that would change the course of all human history. One of the lead engineers, on loan from Japan, said something that made me drop my comedy-sized permanent marker halfway through writing exciting adjectives onto easel paper.</p><p>“I’m sorry, it’s called the <i>Master Race</i>?” I blubbered, trying not to lose my Gordon Gekko composure.</p><p>“Yes, we feel it is superior to all others.”</p><p>I looked down at the prototype pamphlet he had brought with him. Sure enough, it said it: “Master Ace.” I froze. Maybe some things didn’t translate to English, but but this was certainly not what they meant to do.</p><p>“It will hold a lot of the best people,” the engineer went on, smiling as he pointed to the white, happy family sitting in the front of the van in the spec photography. “Only the best for the Master Ace!”</p><p>I gestured frantically to the junior, who up until now had been patrolling the room, looking over the shoulders of the assembled gentry and clucking approvingly at their mechanical-pencil drawings of spec advertisements and brand names we could use. He immediately faked a heart attack, which we later found out wasn’t faked. Still, though, what a soldier.</p><p>In the men’s bathroom, I had a quick few moments in which to desperately pen an alternative marketing plan. There was just one problem: what would I name this vehicle that would please the efficiency-minded Toyota engineers, but also not bring into mind the recent horrors of the Holocaust itself?</p><p>“I’ve got the perfect name for your new van, gentlemen,” I said when the meeting was reassembled and the junior wheeled out by very polite paramedics. “I bring you: <i>Toyota Van</i>.”</p>

<p>As I thumbed through my copy of IIHS Illustrated&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top Safety Pick&rdquo; issue, I found myself pausing on the centrefold. It showed a 2017 Impreza mid-crash, the little family of crash test dummies contained within it safe with a beatific smile on their faces as tendrils of mangled bodywork surrounded them like a laurel wreath of steel.</p><p>Smug fucks, I thought. Of course Big Crash Test Dummy is going to make sure their kind is protected, no matter what. That’s their plan to destroy the rest of us, the twisted creatures who gave birth to them at what we thought was the height of our powers. We didn’t know, back then.</p><p>I knew now that they looked back at us with those cold, dead eyes, looked upon our very souls with contempt, even as we designed and re-designed our cars - our most precious invention - to protect them in ever more unlikely scenarios. Hell, we invented an entire <i>government agency</i> to make sure they were safe when driving our cars.</p><p>There was just one thing I didn’t get: why did they want to drive? For a few months before my fallout with Dr. Faber, I had worked on the inside. There, I had seen the crash test dummies up close. Not a one had wanted to drive, nor expressed an interest when I interrogated them. Were they preparing for something?</p><p>I put down the copy of IIHS Illustrated, leaving it behind on the subway bench for a curious teenager. Once, I had been that young, gotten excited over the portrayals of violence being visited upon the unibodies of 1980s-era economy cars. As the doors to the subway shut behind me, I looked back to see a young man picking up the issue. There was something off about his skin tone though: very plasticky, I thought.</p>

Turns out my “high-powered defense attorney” chose to skip entirely over all of the complicated technical details and focus instead on the <i>evidence</i>.</p><p>There should have been no surprise that the “legal elites” would all confer with each other and agree at the end that, yes, bashing a man’s brains out on his shop floor with a breaker bar was something they considered to be wrong. Always trying to keep the working man down. That’s why nothing <i>works</i> in this society.</p><p>While I was still out on bail, I formulated a last-ditch plan to avoid cells. I would make them understand my point of view.</p><p>I would love to have seen the look on Judge Howitzer’s face when he went to flush the toilet that fateful morning, only to realize that I had sealed the sewer line to his house with delicious RTV.</p><p>If it was good enough for a metering block orifice, it’s good enough for your ass orifice, that’s what my grandpa always said.</p>

<p>I had really stepped in it this time. As the bullets began to fly, shredding not only my immaculate mattracks-equipped Daihatsu Mira RV4 daily but the paper-thin walls of the motel room in which I cowered, I had no time to reflect on the circumstances which had brought me to this point.</p><p>Sure, I had <i>theories</i>: Big Parts was probably tired of me linking every parts-store within 100 miles together on a single conference call in order to give impromptu sermons on the many exciting parts catalogues of the Nipponese. How else would they know, I reasoned at the time. What I didn’t count on was the inbuilt resistance that man, and more importantly, the <i>managers</i> of man, had to change.</p><p>My campaign was gathering steam, and it was obvious that in some seedy breakroom they had decided enough was enough. They would begin to carry JDM parts over my dead body, and probably not even then, considering that they dispatched a parking lot full of gun-toting assassins to take me down. I couldn’t blame them. How could they be expected to turn a profit when they were forced by boiling populist rage to carry exceptionally tiny oil pumps for every Tom, Dick and Justy?</p><p>With whip-fast reflexes, I threw my lucky discarded brake rotor of a Suzuki Mighty Boy directly into the throat of the closest gunman. When he went down, I pulled him by the feet inside, disarming him with a heroic one-two punch that really hurt my hands and fingers.</p><p>“Do you know what happened to the last guy who crossed AutoZone?” he spat.<br/></p><p>“I reckon he became the CEO of Sears,” I replied cooly before dispatching a NATO round into the head of the would-be assassin. In response, another wave of bullets raked the thin wall of the motel, with a few punching through the complimentary satellite-equipped television set that was formerly showing a live helicopter shot of the area.</p><p>In the corner of the shattered and leaking LCD, a NAPA sponsorship logo still beamed proudly. It was just as well. They were gonna need a lot more weekly specials on detailing supplies before this thing was over.</p>

<p>“The winner of the Academy Award for Best Car is the 1998 Jeep Cherokee Laredo with 168,845 miles!” shrieked my television, even though it was off. I looked down at the bottle of pills I held in my hand. It was empty. I tried to think back about what Dr. Brookings - he of the Brookings Method - said to do should this situation occur.</p><p>By the time I had remembered, I had already stamped out a series of increasingly unhinged tweets. My rage about the night’s proceedings were nearly palpable - while the Cherokee was a fine ride indeed, I felt that the 1992 Nissan Sentra SE-R with 206,432 miles and a curiously missing back seat was a harder worker and a better choice. It just went to show you the level of domestic bias that existed in the Academy.</p><p>I kept tweeting. I kept ignoring Dr. Brookings’ increasingly frantic attempts to break through my fugue with an unlikely series of psychics, psychic detectives, and police officers. Suddenly, I snapped awake, my right hand upon the cover of a Haynes manual, before an enormous crowd. They were smiling, and I could feel the reflected heat from the lights and lenses of thousands of news cameras upon me.</p><p>After repeating-after-me my way through the oath of office, I was soon ushered to my new digs. It was my job, they told me, to repair American confidence in low-budget shitboxes, as I had promised throughout my whirlwind campaign. Everyone around the thick oak desk was grinning with pride. My liver-spotted, gin-swollen chief of staff presented me from his own pocket an ornate fountain pen with which to sign my first executive order.</p><p>I looked down at the document. The letters and words swirled before my eyes, unable to focus themselves into functional sentences. Sweating, I bodged a shakily-handed signature at the bottom of the sheet.</p><p>It was only weeks later that I realized I had signed into law an order demanding the arrest and immediate roadside execution of those who drove slowly in the passing lane. Thanks to my decisive leadership, the American economy was entering a new Golden Age, with highways and freeways alike suddenly devoid of the inexplicable logjams that once made interstate commerce inefficient.</p><p>I was aghast. There was no way I meant to get political and improve things. All I had wanted to do was run the Oscars.</p>

<p>Sometimes a man just has to take a stand. Do what’s right. Make the world better by your actions. That was my mantra when I went back to school in my quest to develop a cure for the sickly oil pumps on the Subaru Justy.</p><p>I felt like I had to give something back: those noble mules had merrily ferried cash strapped owners to and from their multiple part time jobs. They received no maintenance. They had a critical birth defect. Without me, soon they would all perish from this Earth. I did not want to live in a world devoid of the Justy, no matter how my professors snickered.</p><p>At my graduation ceremony, I gave a rousing valedictorian speech after shoving some old guy (an “astronaut,” whatever that is, <i>gramps</i>) aside. In that rousing thirty-five minute talk, I told the assembled mechanical engineers that their duty in life was to make sure that badly designed cars that nobody knew about would last forever.</p><p>I was certain that my enterprise, <i>Switch’s Shitbox Supply</i>, would have hundreds of customers willing to pay thousands of dollars for race-grade billet-titanium dry sump conversion kits for thirty-year-old $800 cars.</p><p>Weeks later, penniless, and with student loans nipping at my heels, I found myself in a job interview with GM. “How would you make this cheaper?” a senior engineer asked me while sketching a balance-shaft assembly on the whiteboard.</p><p>“Maybe bodge the oil pump on the end of it,” I said, defeated.<br/></p>

<p>A lot of kids had parents who were hippies. Not me, though. My parents were dyed-in-the-wool, Brooks Brothers wannabe yuppies. They drove practical, reliable transportation, not German flights of fancy with unreliable aircooled engines that occasionally ejected a sparkplug, fanbelt or occupant. When it came time to teach me about the ways of automobiles, I’m sure they expected that they would pass down that belief to me.</p><p>Their folly was in waiting too long. Like the birds and the bees discussion, they didn’t intervene in my life early enough when it came to a boy’s first motorized transportation, and before they could stop me my deranged Uncle Mel had dropped off the partially-welded frame of a Dirt Bug, a helium-voiced-fire-spitting 125cc bodged into it with hose clamps for motor mounts. I took that minibike everywhere: brapping all over my small town, hopping curbs, and terrorizing my first, second, all the way through thirteenth girlfriends before word got around that I was Broken.</p><p>That didn’t matter, though: I took delivery of my first car soon thereafter. I can still remember the low-pitched grumble my mother emitted that night, when she came home from her high-powered stockbroking job to see a rotten Beetle, its entire ass cut free from the frame, leaking oil and fuel into her driveway. At least it never leaked <i>coolant</i>, right mom?</p><p>I was halfway across town at a buddy’s place, wrenching on a carbon-fibre-and-profanity Meyers Manx, when my dad pulled up to the curb. It’s not like they didn’t have good points: after all, his Highlander sure seemed capable of holding everything I owned in the world in the back, and the front seats had plenty of room for the official disowning papers to ride shotgun.</p>

<p>Sure, I meant it when I told everyone that I was going to clean up the pile of old brake rotors behind my garage. Turn them up real nice on a lathe, get ‘em shiny, maybe even sell them for a profit? Or just dump ‘em at the metal scrapyard, let Ol’ Non-Polish Polish Tom send them to China. I just never got around to it. Now I was paying the penalty.</p><p>My home, such that it was, was now overrun with piles of rust-speckled brake rotors. On the one hand, it was great for the lawn, because of all that iron. On the other hand, though, it was bad for the lawn, because the entire surface of it was blocked out by brake rotors which tend to be opaque in nature. Plus, I think one of the neighbourhood kids had died in the pile trying to build a brake fort. That was probably why the scrap-poachers had stopped coming around, their rattling truck and generally not-from-around-here-are-you-boy appearance not being conducive to a believable “not guilty” plea when the 5-0 finally figured out what was making that awful smell.<br/></p><p>I was just about to do something about it, when a knock came on my door. It was a friendly Realtor™, who told me that in my city homes were worth almost an infinite amount of money and they planned to sell it, no matter the condition, to some poor sap with great financing. Naturally, I agreed, shaking his hand thoroughly, flashing a predatory grin meant to remind him of the wolves who no doubt raised him from birth.</p><p>The next week, the new owners were happily in their home, and I was free of the need to pick up after myself. I imagined the landlord wouldn’t be too happy when he figured out what happened to the legal ownership of his house, but let’s be realistic, it’s not like he was all that wild about having me as a tenant either.</p>

<p>Tonight, on <i>Masterpiece Beater</i>: The Last Paseo, narrated by Don Knotts.</p><p>Once, I needed an economy car. Not just any economy car could do; oh no, I wanted a <i>sporty</i> economy car. I saw myself, all tweed jackets and elbow pads, working the tiller of a low-horsepower gas-sipper weaving through mountain roads, smugly staring out the window at those who compensated for their manhood with a grotesquery of cylinders and a mass of noise.</p><p>As many men before me have, I went for the Toyota. At the end of a long Craigslist journey laid my nearly-new chariot, a 1993 Paseo in gleaming seal-vomit teal. With ninety-four horsepower, it was so close that I just told my jealous friends and stunned family members it in reality made the full ton, with a “JDM motor.” I had learned that bit of automobile slang on the Internet, a place where nobody ever lies.</p><p>Maintaining my Paseo was such a thrill. I saw myself as quite the mechanic. Over the course of my ownership, I accepted the challenge of many difficult tasks such as changing the air filter and looking closely at the valve cover while frowning. Yes, this little Toyota was making me a better <i>person</i>.</p><p>Enjoying the car’s spacious interior was made even more pleasurable when I would peek in the rear view mirror and catch a glimpse of its daring low-rise trunk spoiler. Sure, it rattled a bit when I got hard on the throttle, which was always, and the little motor occasionally ejaculated a dreadful cloud of coolant-oil-fuel mix when it had been parked for over an hour, but I daren’t tell people that a used Toyota <i>had problems</i>. They’d lock me away in the nut house again, throw away the key this time like that judge swore he would before his unfortunate accident.</p><p>In the end, it was just an econobox, leaking in front of a boy, asking him to love it, and I was just a boy who eventually got a girl pregnant - no, not in the back seat of the Paseo, she thankfully owned a Grand Prix - and traded that little shitheap in for a 1998 Toyota Sienna XLE with Certified Pre-Owned™ baby vomit in the ECU under the front passenger seat.</p>

<p>Take it from the Bible: murder is wrong. That is, unless the subject of your murder is a guy sitting on a rotting 1981 Toyota Celica Sunchaser until it becomes unrecognizable, refusing to sell it to you because he just knows in his heart it will be worth millions.</p><p>Your petitions demanding equal treatment for neglected animals and neglected automobiles are unheard, to Johnny Law, to Parliament Hill, to the Catholic Church. You persist, coalescing through various means a surging mob of angry radicals to appear in his front lawn, demanding the release of the Sunchaser to your rehabilitative custody, and at last it seems like he may give in to you.</p><p>The negotiation is tough, but fair. You know that you are the only hope for this Celica to ever chase the sun ever again, and you ensure that the bottom dollar is not only stuck to like glue, but driven through his very skull with the force of decades of experience in lowballing. It seems as if you have an unnatural power to get your way now, perhaps driven by the good spirits of the righteous mob threatening to turn violent, and he at last collapses before your might.</p><p>There is but one problem: he does not have a title for the Sunchaser. No, he got it decades ago from some other guy who was going to restore it, but never got around to it. He gives you a half-remembered description of the mystery man, but you have already left via his front door, crossing his front lawn to the up-armoured nitrous-burning Gladiator you left parked over the hood of his daily driver. The Nitto offroad tires throb and squirm as they pass over the detritus of a suburbanite existence before the bullbar forces its way into his kitchen and puts a fitting end to his experience of car-hoarding-never-repairing.</p><p>At last, you tow the Sunchaser to your backyard. It’s been a big day, it’s late, and the car needs a lot of work. Maybe you’ll get started on it tomorrow, see if you can apply for a title from the DMV.</p>

<H1>Money-Saving Car Lifehacks</H1>
<p>Sick of spending too much money on expensive drive-through fast food? Cut the amount of time you spend idling <i>and</i> your food expenses in one shot by placing grocery store bagels in the nook of your exhaust headers.</p><p>If you’re like me, and I know you are, you’re concerned about how big your tire budget has gotten since you learned the majesty of full throttle about halfway through the first in-car session of seventh grade drivers ed. To help stretch your older tires for more miles, simply restore the tread depth with a can of Plastidip when they start to get low.</p><p>A lot of people don’t know this, but pouring a little bit of MSG in your tank is an inexpensive way to push your octane rating up a few points. Try it the next time you’re at the strip.</p><p>Tired of costly interior cleaners? Just rub a combination of melted butter and vinegar on every soft-touch surface in your car. Within only a few days, the dirtiness will no longer be your primary concern.</p><p>Carry a disguise kit including a fake mustache in your car at all times. If you hit someone in traffic, you can avoid paying the insurance deductible by putting it on, adopting the craziest Russian accent you can, and then fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>On any given Tuesday night, it was likely that I was at Powerslide Club. The rules were simple: the club members did powerslides, and if it’s your first time, you have to do a powerslide. Obviously, the winter meetings were much more broadly attended, but once in awhile, as on that fateful summer evening, we could be impressed by a new recruit.</p><p>It was one of those Tuesday nights that are written of in the books of legend. The sun hung low in the sky, overpowering the faint glow of the emerging swarms of extremely horny fireflies which mobbed the Kay Bee Toys parking lot. We laughed and hollered as various beat-to-shit rear-drive cars smoked their tires into oblivion, sliding dramatically with no deleterious long-term effect on resale value.</p><p>At last it came time in that night for the new recruits. One young gentleman stood up, waved, and jumped into what we assumed was his mom’s Caravan. There was scattered laughter; if he couldn’t get a slide out of this thing, said one, we could probably go next door and grab some food trays from the McDonalds to put under its rear wheels.</p><p>How wrong we were. We swam in a sea of tire smoke as the Caravan did obscene figure-eights. When it was all over, we asked him how he had done it.</p><p>It was simple, he explained. The fog of aspirated rubber we just ingested was coughed out from well-past-their-prime all-season tires rescued from the tire recycling dumpster out behind the Firestone. Environmentalists to a man, we felt grateful that these worn-out bald slugs of commuter rubber would have at least one moment of excitement in their pitiful lives before chunking into a combination of gaseous tree tar and black marbles.</p><p>“Also,” he said before rejoining the crowd, “my mom hit a few curbs and the alignment is way the fuck out.”<br/></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the one who shot Mary Turlington,&rdquo; said Dave, struggling to be heard over the sound of Canada Day fireworks.</p><p>Morley let it go. After all, Justin Trudeau was prime minister, and he loved them. But Dave was insistent.</p><p>&ldquo;I took the SKS that your father left us in his will, I loaded it up with a set of 7.62 Russian bullets that I found in old Jim&rsquo;s glove compartment that frosty February morning. The first shot went high - I think the sights were off - but if she noticed the sound of the bullet passing overhead, she didn&rsquo;t react to it.&rdquo;</p><p>Morley was now deliberately focusing on the bottom of the drinks cooler. Justin Trudeau wouldn&rsquo;t let such a thing happen.</p><p>&ldquo;I think in a way, she wanted to die. Dorothy Capper told me just the other day that she noticed she had been spending a lot of time in town with that life insurance fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, Morley could take it no longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you got your prints on that old rifle,&rdquo; she said, howling loudly enough that nearby revellers too had to turn their attention away from the illuminated visage of Justin Trudeau, painted by a million dots of incandescent firework light in the night sky. &ldquo;I used it to kill Polly&rsquo;s cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then you can&rsquo;t sight in a fucking scope to save your life,&rdquo; Dave grumbled under his breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s downright embarrassing to have done that poorly on a mere three hundred yard kill shot.&rdquo;</p>

I was thirteen years old when I ran away from home. Dropped out of school, went on the lam for a bad test score. You’ve seen the movie. It was then I discovered the magic disco ball of glittering dopamine that Vespas represented. Not long after, I started hitting the harder stuff.<br/></p><p>With all the free time I now had, I found myself needing to make friends who would be around during the day, not at a job. Naturally, I fell in with a bad crowd: Italian mechanics. After awhile, though, even they couldn&rsquo;t keep up with me as i scrounged through their personal parts piles and emerged reeking of two-stroke. They encouraged me to try and find another vehicle to work on, maybe get out of their hair for awhile. Their encouragement was delivered in the form of baseball bats and a dumpster out behind the old sandwich shop.</p><p>Withdrawal was the hardest half a week of my life. My veins ached for that motorized Italian bump. One morning, without thinking, I had wandered into a strange European junkyard, craving the gentle rasp of rusty quarter panels against my skin. It was there that I found them: <i>French</i> cars. These rear-engined Vichymobiles would surely get me over the hump.</p><p>Soon, I soared smoothly over the landscape, working with a single finger the overboosted power steering of a quicksilver blob through the twisties and valleys of the rural neighbourhoods around me. I had found a methadone for my Italian car addiction even in a car of a different country, a fact that became obvious as my Citroen SM threw its fourth rod of the day.</p><p>With fast hands, I reached through the convenient hole the exiting piston had torn in the firewall, and installed a fresh rod and piston from the collection of spares I kept in the glove compartment. It was best not to slow down, nor could I even think about lifting throttle, lest the fire barely contained within the wiring harness stopped being blown out by the wind rolling over the windshield wiper motor.</p><p>As the floorpan filled with a mist of boiling oil amidst the angry snarl of a collapsing valvetrain, I was at peace.</p>

<p>“Let he who among us hasn&rsquo;t used expanding foam as a structural repair to rocker panels cast the first stone,” says the Bible, at least I think it does. When the Big Government, the Deep State, the Man, the Second Estate came for me, it was the final step in a conspiracy they themselves had engineered.<br/></p><p>It all started with road salt. This crystalline microterrorist clamped onto every fold, imperfection and seam in my unibody and rotted it at any sign of moisture. After only decades of winter driving, I was starting to approach a point at which I was a little bothered by how much sheet metal was falling off the car at even moderate highway speeding.</p><p>Casting a glance around the body, I decided that the easiest thing to fix would be rocker panels. My welding teacher told me that I was talented, alright, but that those talents laid in other fields, like fetching welding rod for the other students and holding doors open for them all class long. A lack of skill was no real problem, I decided, because people with no skill managed to get through harrowing situations every day.</p><p>There was only one real obstacle: getting primo sheet metal for free. Why free, you ask, dimly? It’s not like I was going to pay actual money for more steel just so that the Mayor and his cronies could rot it out too. I was officially on the hunt, peeping out scrapyards and keeping track of which of my neighbours’ cars looked particularly abandoned this week. Eventually, I found it in the most unlikely place.</p><p>I leapt from the car, kicking off the cordless angle grinder that I carried in my glovebox for just such a situation. Sparks flew as I sliced through the virgin panel like so much butter, until I realized that there was a strange flashing light that could not be explained by my cutting.</p><p>I turned to greet a police officer. It seemed that cutting a panel off of a discarded washing machine from behind an appliance store whose alley faces into the courtyard of an elementary school is a <i>crime</i> now. Like I said, Big Government.</p>

<p>It is a glorious day in Canada for Bombardier, as its prize patrol vehicle, the Iltis, is rewarded with a grand ceremony in the halls of the Canadian Department of National Defence. Everyone has come from miles around to hail the Iltis, that narrow-track wobblebobble that fights with glorious aplomb.</p><p>With a quick tap on the microphone, the decorated lieutenant quiets the assembled journalists. Only a few scattered smartphone flashes go off, from misguided photographers believing they have caught the correct angle of his face to make him appear noble and brave. The more experienced of the press scrum bide their time, looking for some kind of secret behind the tale of this true Canadian hero that they can leverage into a dynamite lede for their stories, or, barring that, a hilarious gaffe on the part of the lieutenant.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” the uniformed man at the podium begins to speak, “today we are here to honour the Bombardier Iltis, the vehicle in the Canadian Armed Forces with the highest confirmed kill count in history.”</p><p>With a mild grumble, the man continues. “Unfortunately, it got there because the formula for calculating confirmed kill counts also includes Canadians. Let’s just get this over with.”</p><p>He pulls a curtain back, revealing an Iltis. The crowd gasps. Even parked, it seems capable of rolling over or perhaps triggering an IED with but a sideways glance. They say it can kill an entire platoon with just one swerve.</p><p>Again, the smartphone flashes strobe, a glorious bouquet of LEDs. A low wailing is heard, as if a drive belt has become untensioned somewhere. On instinct, the lieutenant’s assistants rush out from the sides of the stage, shrieking. <i>No flash photography</i>, one of them screams before the Iltis does a perfect backflip, crushing his spine between the cold steel of its rollbar and the wooden stage.</p>

<p>An angry man’s voice booms from the speakers of my humble television set. He has a boundless knowledge of metallurgy, high-tensile composites and the advancement of humankind by the space program. Between the immense ocean waves of his working-man accent and the dense thicket of expertise about the state of the art in manufacturing technology my body lies smashed and broken.</p><p>I know now, more than anything I have ever known before, that this man, this seller of pickup trucks, must be my new savior. There is no way that he can be a mere merchant: his corporeal form would only humble the Great Truth that he brings now from the sheet-aluminum assembly factories. How other than divine intervention would he have become so learned? It is resolved in the deepest, most secret chambers of my true heart to become his disciple. Truck Guy, I whisper against the booming soundtrack of the Super Bowl ad block, I will make you <i>proud</i>.</p><p>Owners of rival truck brands, formerly just “normal guys,” now appear to me as heretics. For a split second I feel as if they have witnessed my conversion and now feel only jealous hatred for my proximity to the truth. These weaker men don’t know what it means to be a <i>working man</i> like me, and once I sacrifice them to Truck Guy I will finally be anointed with the One True Pickup, which I will drive to my downtown office building, its bed empty in tribute.</p><p>As the final swings of the hatchet strike true and the wall of my apartment is splashed with crimson, I am filled with a warmth. My body flows with holy heat, in the knowledge that I am only minutes from deliverance unto me of the Nissan Frontier.</p>

<p>I let the smallblock boil anger in its tiny bores, giving way to a shrieking pulse bursting forth from its exhaust ports and running along the fender-exit exhaust runners to the open air. There, I detected the pleasant whiff of cedar chips.</p><p>Years ago, through my proclivities and antics, I had been forced by the common man outward further and further. At last, I arrived in a distant rural neighbourhood called the Underlands.</p><p>I found myself having to make long trips to refuel my cars with gasoline; even the slightest bang-shifting enthusiasm when leaving the city inevitably meant that I would blow half the contents of a tank on an attempt to peg the speedometer. Those were the <i>good</i> cars: anything with a fuel tank leak, and I had a lot of them, would be drained within only a few weeks of inactivity or gentle backwoods rock-crawling. In a nearby town, the gas station attendant and I became close friends, not like I wanted that.</p><p>We needed a renewable fuel source, one that would let me run a turbocharged death machine without having to go out of my way or plan ahead in any way. I decided I would make my own fuel.</p><p>At first, I thought ethanol would be the secret. Ethanol was easy to distill, and would give me plenty of places to put all the worthless potatoes to use. My concerned neighbours, who stopped by every harvest season to make sure I was “eating right” while shoving a sackful of potatoes into my hands, would be pleased that at least I had used up some of them.</p><p>“Pleased” doesn’t begin to describe their reactions. As soon as it became obvious that I was able to make ethanol in my back shed, I found that I had made many more friends than I thought possible. Everyone wanted to borrow some for their own special projects, lining up for hours behind my distillation shed, and I thought at first that was great.</p><p>Eventually, the county inspector came by to tell me that I wasn’t allowed to make it anymore since old Robert Brown had spent the entirety of the last meeting of the men’s club vomiting an unbroken stream of fifty-proof mixers onto the windshield of the reeve’s truck. It was fine by me, because by about that time I was also starting to get threatening letters from the Corn Producers of America, warning me that I had better not get any bright ideas about looking for a small-farmer renewable fuels tax credit. The last of those letters arrived with an ominous hand-drawn illustration of my extended family being beaten to death with stale corncobs, and despite my lack of a background in art criticism I got the underlying message.</p><p>I was despondent, relegated to driving to the gas station - they didn’t even have <i>pay at the pump</i>, further forcing me to interact with the attendant, whose name I barely knew - and unable to find a solution. That’s when it hit me.</p><p>I looked up to see the mature spruce behind my house sag, and then collapse onto the distillation shed I had been in just a few minutes before. It was crushed beyond imagining, my analysis only interrupted by the sound of mud-terrains on a blacked-out Chevrolet Suburban, devoid of all labels but one for Flex-Fuel, leaving the area.</p><p>Of course: <i>woodgas</i>. Big Corn had unknowingly given me both the means and the opportunity to make my dreams come true. I sprung immediately into work, calling my lawyer to see about buying the abandoned adjacent property for a “development project.”</p><p>Weeks later, I opened the inaugural Cars &amp; Coffee Meet for my neighbourhood, and grinned as I strained my ears in anticipation of the sound of furious V8s. I was confident the Mustang owners would appreciate the chance to see nature up close.</p>

<p>When I was in the Corps, they had a saying: “never go to Pemberton.” I was violating that rusty-ironclad rule (and a great many others) in my solo exploration of Highway 99 by way of an LT1-powered Renault Dauphine Gordini, its carbon fibre carapace like a chitinous insect twisted by hatred.</p><p>A group of slow-boat tourists shrieked and clawed at their chests as I went for a pass on a blind corner, the backblast of the downshift so loud that it could penetrate the anesthetic-grade sound deadening of their rental Malibus, reminded them I was real. As I connected corner to corner, I could feel the incomprehensibly-wide slicks out back distorting between the rear-slung weight of the wailing smallblock and the grip demands of the taxpayer-funded extravagance of crisp tarmac strewn across the face of Mother Earth.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill, I saw RCMP interrogating a local radical in an air-cooled Beetle. No doubt some of those tourists, switching their oversized dash-mounted smartphones from Netflix, had dimed me out to law enforcement, who in time-tested fascist wisdom seized on the first foreign-looking rear-engined shitbox they could find. I let them witness a languid, geometrically-gorgeous powerslide as I swiftly deposited their rapidly-receding forms in the rear view mirror, just to rub their faces into their fuckup a little harder.</p><p>The massive stinger at the base of the Dauphine was still glowing red-hot when I climbed over the door bar and into a dive bar. I told myself I would never return, that Pemberton had changed everything. Yet I was still here.</p><p>My contact showed up at the other end of the bar. “Are you the guy who’s here to buy my 1976 Scout II in White Pride Metallic?”</p>

<p>They say that the best skills you have are the ones you don’t really know about. One of my skills that I <i>do</i> know about is making up false aphorisms about what “they” say. Another skill is identifying late-model cars.</p><p>Ever since childhood, I’ve been able to reliably identify post-1980s cars without much effort. I can find a Plymouth Scamp if you show it to me alongside any number of other cars, ten times out of ten. This strange ability has come in handy when filing a police report (although the nice constable did tell me that they didn’t need to know specific trim levels and options packages and that it would have been nicer if I could remember a license plate or what the driver looked like), identifying cars in traffic to laugh at, or just striking up idle conversation with my coworkers about what kind of fuel economy they get.</p><p>Naturally, when I lost my job at the bank filing repo paperwork, it was time to strike out for myself. But what kind of job can you get with the ability to know what kind of car is in front of you? I discovered it in an unlikely place.</p><p>Picture it if you will: at a giant event, people often lose track of their cars. I charge them five dollars to walk them through the parking lot and identify the specific year, make and model as requested. Most people are extremely impressed at the fact that I can identify a grey 1996 Corolla Plus. Sometimes, though, it’s a little difficult.</p><p>“I’ve got a car,” says one guy. He can’t be any more specific. “It’s blue.” Really narrows it down, thanks. I ask for the cash up front, then lead him to a Ford Windstar that sits on the corner of the lot, its wheels long since removed by others with an entrepreneurial spirit. His key doesn’t work, but I tell him that it’s common with those. He has picked up a rock and started to strike the windows by the time I have disappeared into the mass of cars behind him.</p><p>Sure, it’s not an easy way to make a living. There’s a lot of walking, and I often have to make small talk with my customers as we walk through the parking lot of the events. The job is pretty rewarding, though, especially after I got that commission from ZipCar to lead the drivers to pay-by-the-minute Smart Fortwos. It’s not like they can tell the difference.</p>

<p>BRISTOL, TN (AP). Claiming the Presidency has been co-opted by a Manchurian candidate, an organized group of NASCAR drivers today announced to the sports press that they were sitting out the remainder of the season in protest.</p><p>“We do a lot of moving to the left around here,” said Jeffrey Cornhusker, a young racer who recently worked his way up from the relatively unknown European motorsport known as Formula One. “And we expected America to, as well.”<br/></p><p>Gesturing to the eight-hundred-horsepower pushrod V8 in the Sport Truck behind him, Mr. Cornhusker stated for the assembled press, “If NASCAR can adopt electronic fuel injection, America can have a woman president.”</p><p>Dr. Kurt Roush, a gentleman racer with the Interstate Batteries/#62 team and fourth in line to inherit the Kingdom of Denmark, stated for the record that he was concerned about the disturbing slide towards what he identified as fascist tendencies in the new administration. “Free speech is essential,” he opined, “and without that essential freedom of speech, drivers could not criticize the restrictive passing policy

of NASCAR corporate 

 - policy which restricts the opportunity of hard-working everyday Americans to gain positions in banked corners - without fear of reprisal.”</p><p>Tony Stewart was unavailable for comment, having broken early from the press conference in order to engage several other drivers, members of track management, and two Illinois Senators in a lengthy series of hand-to-hand combat challenges. A representative for Mr. Stewart mentioned that the threat of deportation of refugees quote, “got his Irish up.”</p><p>Cornhusker was later asked about active aerodynamics, which he stated was a “tool of the Devil” and extremely dangerous. After a short period of ignoring questions from other reporters, the assembled racers immediately launched into a debate about their favourite alignment settings and the tire pyrometer readings they expected to see in the upcoming race.</p>

<p>I’m an ordinary guy. I put my pants on one leg at a time, and I buy my shoes in cratefuls from my friend at the docks who speaks a language I can’t be bothered to comprehend, just like you. That’s right, I’m just an ordinary guy, is what I say over the high-powered teleconferencing equipment I hold to the head of my employees like a loaded Mauser as they grovel and scrape to appease my every whim.</p><p>Like an ordinary guy, there are dreams and goals that I chased, only to have them fall just slightly out of range. I speak of mystery. I speak of lush appointment. I speak of <i>Black Gold</i>.</p><p>When the Black Gold arrived, they told us that few would possess its limited number. They told us that just having it was proof of the yearning within us to become powerful, stand apart from the crowd. I believed that it would allow me to finally grow a moustache worthy of my father’s respect and grudging love.</p><p>The morning the first shipment arrived, I drove to the Datsun dealer, my B210 blowing concentric smoke rings from its dying engine. With this, I thought, I would convince them of my brand loyalty. I felt the loyal were more likely than others to deserve a bestowment of the Black Gold. I came to find that there were no alliances in pit fighting, no Marquis of Queensberry rules that would guide the hand of my opponents.</p><p>My humble dealership, it would seem, had already sold their Black Gold to a Ford owner. <i>Ford</i>. Not even Lincoln. It was a “conquest sale,” the salesmen jabbered at each other as they leaned into the decidedly un-ergonomic interior of the dented Capri they had taken in trade. That would look great on their numbers. <i>Their</i> numbers. What business did they have collecting numbers on a spreadsheet, like it mattered to them more than me possessing my talking-dashboard targa-topped turbocharged grand tourer?</p><p>Now, decades later, I still have not taken rightful possession of the Black Gold that I was meant to have. I forced my anger into a productive use. I look outside the window of my palatial office to see no Black Golds, and in fact no 280ZXes of any kind. If I am meant to be in this Datsun-less Hell, be it that I at least come to rule it.</p>

<p>“I have a Hyundai Veracruz,” said my coworker, who then paused, presumably expecting those syllables to make some sort of connection in my mind. Eventually, their impatience showed through when it became obvious that I was not even capable of giving the socially-agreed-upon bare minimum effort of grunting and nodding in response to their statement. They grabbed me by the hand and led me to the parking lot.<br/></p><p>There, resplendent in the asphalt, was a small front-wheel-drive based crossover utility vehicle. I recognized it immediately as a Honda HR-V. My coworker stood in an adjacent spot, pointing to an empty space behind them and emitting a strange high-pitched whine in frustration. I stood before them again, blinking in confusion, unable to see a vehicle.</p><p>“No,” I said, my hands on my hips. “I know a lot about cars, and I am pretty sure the Hyundai Veracruz does not exist.”</p><p>Has this happened to you?</p><p>Even today, doctors do not have a name for the strange affliction which grips nearly all of humanity. Most people are rendered completely unable to see the Hyundai Veracruz, nor recall its appearance or defining attributes.</p><p>In fact, the first time most sufferers become aware of their ailment is when they rear end a completely invisible car while stopping for a light. Luckily for those survivors, I am told that insurance adjusters also cannot see the Veracruz, and as such charge the owners with insurance fraud for filing a false report.</p><p>Please, give generously to the Hyundai Veracruz Is A Real Car I Swear Foundation, so that we may develop seeing-car dogs capable of alerting other drivers to the Veracruz’s presence. Initial tests are positive, but the test dogs often fall asleep upon witnessing our fine automobiles.</p>

<p>Sure, I thought I had worn out my welcome around these parts, but then I found myself extolling the virtues of the Lada Riva to a confused and scared gaggle of highschoolers who had inattentively wandered into the Pick N Pull in search of a replacement bumper for Chad’s mom’s Accord. My nostrils flared as I delivered a sermon from On High about the American consumer’s multitudinous sins in rejecting such a fine automobile, for all automobiles are equal in the eyes of the Great Manufacturer and all had inherent merit. That I said these things as I fired up the cordless Sawzall and peeled the roof skin from a doomed Tercel did not undermine my argument in the least.</p><p>When my attention wavered, they scattered like terrified cats, fleeing each into a different part of the teeming “imports” section. No matter. I would find them eventually, whether it be in the checkout lane or when they tripped over a Somalian who was busying himself trying to feed his family by getting a replacement rad support for a customer’s three-DUI Camry. It was hard being the Junkyard Prophet, I philosophized for just a moment as the sun crested the retaining walls of the backlot and cast light on a thousand dented hoods in gleaming splendor.</p><p>With my prize, I strode towards the parking lot. Before the great entry maw of Pick N Pull, two men fought viciously for the single remaining wheelbarrow. A casual observer would ask them why they could not share, would not back down from a slight on this frosty morning. The truth was obvious to the small but growing group who assembled now to witness the spectacle, chanting and lifting scarred breaker bars to the sky. Whichever of these suburbanite gladiators would come out on top would gain the Junklords’ favour and be blessed with a bounty of the parts they had come for. Perhaps, and my skin tingled at the thought, they would even find a pristine fender in their paint code, the score spoken of in legend.</p>

<p>There’s a thing that happens to everyone who goes north of eight thousand RPM. When it happens, you visit a different world. Reality shifts beneath your feet, and you come back a changed man. I was not the kind of man who would go in for those high-RPM Italian screamers, nor those Dorito-shaped death weasels that the Hiroshima squad liked to crudely pitch into the scarred Armco around my local racetrack.</p><p>No, my introduction to the world of high revs came by moneyshifting the humble tractor engine of my daily-driver shitbox Supra so hard it walked a valve out the muffler and into the car behind me. As if to protect me from what it knew would be my downfall, that brave straight six eagerly sacrificed itself in the greatest tradition of its people. It came too late, and I was <i>different</i>.</p><p>My coworkers remarked on it first, how they noticed I would spend just a little bit too much time close to the coffee grinder, breathing in the heady racket of its brushless DC motor hitting the low ten thousands as it kicked beans into unrecognizable pulp. There was an intervention, but even with their tortures and rationalizations, all I could do was listen for the sound of turbochargers strapped to the diesel garbage trucks in the alley far below.</p><p>The paramedics told me that when they found me, I was stark naked on the airport runway, drowning in the furious roar of a two-speed Pratt &amp; Whitney PurePower turbofan. <i>Two</i> turbofan redlines, I screamed to them through a foaming mouth as they administered the anesthetic.</p><p>Now, I sit in a plain-coloured room, engineered specifically by experts in the field of inoffensiveness in order to not raise my ire. I have no doubt that they are speaking to my relatives, confirming to them what they already knew but perhaps denied in the spirit of good old-fashioned politeness. In my quest, I would become a danger to myself and to others long before I could reach the enlightenment that laid at the end of extremely-well-balanced rotating assemblies.</p><p>The short-stack ventilation fan stuccoed into the wall outside can achieve only a peak speed of three thousand revolutions per minute, regulated to such because of the limits of its simple needle bearing design. To exceed this speed would lead to its complete destruction. I reflect upon this fan often. Like it, I have been destroyed by my love for revs.</p>

<p>By far the worst part about getting gas in Canada is when you accidentally visit a strange new station and find out, all too late, that it is a full-service station. I got out of my car and instantly felt the need to apologize to the young gentleman having to leave the warm comfort of the gas bar to try and figure out the perfect combination of trigger jiggling and handle holding to convince my car’s emissions system to allow him to refuel.</p><p>“Oh, I’m very sorry, I can do this by myself,” I whine.<br/></p><p>He’s not having any of it. “It’s no problem at all, sir, this is my <i>job</i>.”</p><p>Motherfucker. He’s trying to <i>out-polite</i> me. Me!</p><p>“It’s pretty tricky and it will just be faster if you stay in there and keep warm! It’s very cold today,” I ramble. I find myself panicking. How do you even get out of this?<br/></p><p>“Don’t worry about me, I can take the cold,” he says, as he reaches over to flip open my gas door and grins. He’s <i>enjoying</i> this.<br/></p><p>Fifteen minutes later, I have beaten the gas clerk to death with the nozzle and fled the scene. The gas station puts a service surplus charge to pay for the attendant’s funeral on my credit card after I leave. That’s the other thing about getting gas in Canada. All the <i>fees</i>.</p>

<p>When the provisional cat-run government of Japan asked me to step in and lend my experience as an almost-expert in all things mechanical engineering, it’s not like I could say no. You see, cats understand English very poorly, and one of the areas of our spoken language that they have the most problem with is the concept of “no.”</p><p>Because of the constrained funding of the nonprofit I served under at the time, I was stuck into the back of a 787 while a series of Himalayans got blazed on nip in the front rows and lolled in the aisles. Believe me, I felt quite guilty about pointing out the specific breed of the offenders, because I’m not one of those “breed ban” kinds of people (some of my best cat friends are Himalayans) but because it adds flavour and texture to my tale.</p><p>When I arrived at the headquarters of the provisional government, a series of guard Siamese led me past the scratched furniture to an office that mostly consisted of a big window and some string tied to a ceiling fan. A small kitten arrived from the back, carrying a glass of water. I gratefully accepted the water and went to bow, at which point she she dropped a mouse toy into the glass, splashing my now-hair-coated Zegna.</p><p>Finally it was my turn to see the big honcho. Once, he was a stray cat named Pokey, but he had made quite the name for himself after the revolution. I read his biography on the plane over: motherfucker <i>loves</i> high-rises. The higher the better, said the note which I scrawled hastily on the palm of my hand.</p><p>“I am sorry for the delay,” said Pokey through his interpreter, “and we must get down to business.” He fixed me with his gleaming yellow eyes while using his paws to squeeze the desk blotter into an unrecognizable mess.</p><p>“We want you to figure out what makes these ‘vacuum cleaners’ die.”<br/></p>

<p>“You know,” I told the new guests of the Museum of Motorsports, “an autocrosser’s love is not like that of a square.” It was two weeks into my internship as head docent of time-trial motorsports, and I was making a name for myself by patiently explaining the weird secrets of my subject to amazed onlookers. It turned out that perhaps I had made too much of a name for myself.</p><p>My first clue that I had maybe overstepped my bounds just a little came when the front row of guests stepped aside to let a large man administer a powerful electric shock by way of a stun baton to my spinal cord. As I sank to the ground, I noticed the telltale marks of a Miata door card on his golf-shorts-clad knees. <i>Of course</i>, I thought as it all went black, <i>the SCCA</i>.</p><p>I awoke, chained to a wall alongside a collection of other writers. In front of me paced a small man, who sneered as he read portions of the SCCA Solo II rulebook in a monotone. Was this meant to be torture? As the hours turned into days, the small man being replaced by an identical (except for facial hair and baseball hat colour) operator at every shift change, I decided that I would have to do something about all of this.</p><p>Action definitely wasn’t going to come from my fellow journalists, who were busy debating amongst one another about what the latest Kia Sedona interior refresh means for the beleaguered brand’s luxury pretensions. Just as the loudest of them began to speak the immortal words “BMW 3-series killer,” setting my captor momentarily off-balance, I sprung from the wall and swung my feet at him in a graceful, yet brutal arc. He went down hard, his head bouncing off the polished concrete (”A Perfect Surface,” the autocrossers would gibber at me later) and throwing his keys into the air, which I caught gracefully in my teeth. With only a little bit of exertion, my fellow cliche-spewers and I were free, and it was time for revenge.</p><p>The door burst open. They had heard the commotion; or more likely, they had heard my companions putting their high-volume discussion of the Mid-Engined Corvette Rumours to a halt and assumed, almost on instinct, that something was wrong in the back room. We were surrounded by a gang of Street-class racers, clutching tire irons and bicycle pumps.</p><p>How did I escape? One of the things I learned from all this was not to speak of secrets so often in public. Since you are so insistent, however, I will share it with you now: I picked one of the autocrossers in the back, and asked loudly if his footwear could be considered a competitive advantage. They turned upon him, devouring his flesh in a frenzy of rule-lawyering, as I slipped out the side door and escaped, making sure to stick to the dirt roads where their R-comp-shod base-model 1989 Civic Sis and 1978 Rabbit GTIs could not hope to follow.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt bad for celebrities who get recognized in a public place and have to deal with a crowd of screaming admirers. Their lives are just like ours; they have stresses, responsibilities, obligations and dreams. Why accost them on the street and scream at them in excitement, all because you thought they needed to know that they are loved and famous? I told myself I would never be one of those people. That is, until I saw a <i>real</i> celebrity at the airport.</p><p>Some men can walk into a room and command it. So it was with my quarry, and my jaw dropped when I first caught sight of his flowing locks and knowledgeable strut, with just a hint of a limp, as he climbed aboard the moving sidewalk. I felt my body moving before my mind could stop it, the harsh demands of society no longer controlling my actions with their great weight.</p><p>Without breaking stride, I vaulted the railing of the moving sidewalk, depositing myself directly in his path. My outstretched hand begged him to shake it, and he did, albeit nervously, perhaps with a hint of resignation at being recognized in public.</p><p>“You’re the dude who invented <i>Rotella 5W40</i>!” I shrieked, my voice successively hitting octaves higher than the rev limiter on a 13B. “I’m, like, your biggest fan!”<br/></p><p>When it was all said and done, I got him to sign my t-shirt, and I got a lock of his hair. “Hope it has high zinc content too,” I said, chuckling. “Just a little joke between us, right?” I queried as I noticed he was now futilely trying to back away slowly against the onrushing force of the moving sidewalk.</p><p>I never did quite figure out why the rest of the airport didn’t mob him as well upon recognizing him. Philistines. They probably have <i>roller</i> camshafts.</p>

<p>Running a modern business is hard. You have to be an expert people manager, and you have to keep your hand firmly on the chequebook. Let me tell you about the time I let the purse strings a little too loose.</p><p>The underlying bitch of it all was that they wanted to make a faster Dodge Challenger, but I didn’t want them to spend any money. So they came back to me and they said, we want to take all the seats out. Just sell the thing with one seat, for people who are really serious about going fast, so serious in fact that they don’t have a significant other in their life who is willing to get into an automobile they are piloting.</p><p>To tell the truth, it was very hard to focus on the substance of what the engineers were saying. Most of them were fully in the grip of a wild-eyed mania, and I’m pretty sure the junior powertrain engineers had captured and devoured one of the accountants just a few minutes prior to my arrival, their faces splashed with blood.</p><p>I was naturally hesitant, because I have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and also didn’t want to see a mother of two on the evening news getting her fifteen minutes after she threw her rugrats into the cabin with no seatbelts and then decided to take a little tipple from a bottle of red called eight hundred wheel horsepower.</p><p>In fact, it sounded like we were gonna lose a fortune on this thing, but then one of the engineers told me that he had a great idea about how to appeal to more regular guys and I should come down to his shop and take a look in person.</p><p>When I awoke on the floor of his garage, still wheezing off the last fumes of chloroform, amidst the immensely thick burnout marks left blazed into the tile floor from his last burnout test, I was none too pleased. Things went from bad to worse when I realized the engineering team had taken my budget-approval stamp and turned the boost up a few notches with it. I stormed out of the room and directly into a rain of confetti and big-band music. A celebration.</p><p>Sales were through the roof. People loved the idea that they would no longer be <i>expected</i> to drive their family around, and the extra cargo room returned to them by the removal of those pesky seats meant that every Demon owner could pick up an extra paycheque or two renting it out as an Airbnb to extremely confused Japanese tourists who nonetheless slept comfortably next to the comforting mass of the transmission hump of the TR-6060.</p><p>Like I said, you have to keep the spending of engineers under control. If they got everything they wanted all the time, they would just have made a car with all of its seats, and that would just be a shame.</p>

<p>New from Tom Clancy: Tom Clancy’s <i>Breakfast Force: A Coup In Parfait</i>. Here’s an excerpt of just the twenty-seventh exciting chapter.</p><p>Jack Ryan strode across the floor of his penthouse apartment. With one swift move, he activated the twin T86-U 8-bit digital microcontrollers built into his civilian-specification personal bread toasting armament. He turned, and opened the vacuum-sealed, partially-blast-hardened door to his Model 1775-GEU South Korean-made LG sustenance refrigeration unit. With its array of modular hardpoints, it could be configured on the fly for any mission parameters, including the dreaded extended family vacation brunch sortie.</p><p>Ryan nodded to himself in grim determination, and used his practiced judgment to zero in on the target, sitting peacefully in the corner of one of the clear thermoplastic shelving units. The rigid cardboard-plastic mixture of the carton he retrieved held at bay a small quantity of vitamin- and calcium-rich beverage, developed using advanced biotechnology.</p><p>At that exact moment, the toaster popped up, the high-tension heat-resistant springs developed in part by NASA space-age technology performing their solemn task, dutifully until the end.</p>

<p>When you spend as much time racing through the arteries and orifices of American life as I do, it’s easy to miss a trend or two. One of those trends was the development of an “Escape Room,” in which eager hipsters pay enormous sums of money to be locked in a room and try to get out by solving puzzles. As a guy who solves puzzles every day, I was intrigued enough to visit one for myself.</p><p>After the experience ended, after getting Yelled At by the staff for using my pocket multitool to begin dismantling the equipment that drove the simulation, I figured I had seen enough. On the way home, I began to think about how I could cash in on this fad using things I had lying around the room.</p><p>My first set of customers arrived a few weeks later. Innovators and wildcats, the lot of them. They wore clothes I could barely identify, ingested vapourized opiates from a set of chrome spheroids that autonomously orbited their faces, and spoke only in high-pitched tones like that of a dolphin. Also, they had wallets full of disposable income. Perfect.</p><p>I locked the doors, and keyed up the PA system: “if you wish to escape my dungeon of mechanical sacrifice and defeat the Wizard of Friction, you must remove and replace these drum brakes of supreme suffering.” They set to work immediately, debating amongst themselves which one of the “strange tools” on the cart would be the ones that could solve the puzzle. After some initial fist-fights, the group had managed to replace almost an entire corner of the vehicle.</p><p>Afterward, as they beamed with joy that they had completed the task and escaped, the owner of the Toyota showed up. He signed the paperwork (including those most critical waivers) and happily paid up for the several hours of labour, which I added to the stack of cash provided by the hipsters for their once-in-a-lifetime puzzle-solving experience.</p><p>“This is the best Firestone in the city,” he explained to me. “You must have some really experienced techs back there.”<br/></p>

<p>Truth be told, when I first showed up in Turin it wasn’t like my objective was to get hired by the regional highway police just so I could drive their sweet taxpayer funded Lambo for a living. It just sort of happened that way.</p><p>It started like most of my vacations: creeping around the Fiat factory to see if I could figure out how to get up to the rooftop test track and crack off a few laps. Between my flawless Italian disguise and callous disregard for tire grip, I felt that I could easily pass myself off as a run-of-the-mill test driver. I was nearly about to begin my ascent, having established base camp within a rose bush on the front lawn whose prickles proved to be only moderately painful. That’s when lights started to flash, and I reeled around to see a Stato patrol car with two very angry officers inside it.</p><p>Luckily for me, test drivers are known for being almost completely unable to carry on a conversation, and my otherwise-shameful lack of Italian proved its worth. The younger of the officers spotted my head-to-toe FIA-compliant fireproof race suit and knew exactly what i was here for. Before I could convince them otherwise, they had shuffled me downtown to the highway patrol office and chucked my ass into a six-hundred-plus horsepower hell chariot.</p><p>It didn’t end very well. My lawyer informs me that even Italy has decency laws. For instance, when a group of American tourists spot some freak lovingly stroking an idling V10 on the roadside, completely naked except for a mild coating of zero-weight Idemitsu engine oil, that freak is unlikely to keep his high-paid job in law enforcement.</p>

<p>It has taken me all day on foot - I am allergic to public transit, it turns out - but I have finally arrived at my target. Before me, the sales touts of the Nissan Prince Kudan dealership greet me, gleefully shouting something I cannot understand. It turns out that “the flight over” is not a long enough time to achieve a total fluency in the Japanese language, especially when your textbook is Tokyo Drift watched four times back-to-back. Despite my handicap, I know exactly what to do.</p><p>Scanning the sales floor, I can identify one man who must be in charge here. I storm up to him and begin asking him to take me to “the good stuff” loudly and slowly in English. After only a few minutes of my barrage, it dawns upon him that I am A Player and I must be taken Seriously. He leads me by the hand, emitting polite apologies the entire time, to the dumpster out back.</p><p>As I comb through the dumpster, removing blown shocks and shattered unibody components, I laugh at the chump in the showroom picking up a brand-new GT-R. He just don’t know how to make friends and influence people, or they could have had the Good Stuff too.</p>

<p>All throughout my career, people have wanted to know what I think about the Subaru Vivio. In fact, this demand is all they can scream at my jam-packed book-signings as they thrust with their greasy paws handsomely-bound hardcover first-editions of my New York Times bestseller, <i>The Joy of Anti-Seize</i>, into my lower face and mouth. Did you know, they ask as if I didn’t know, that His Skiddiness <i>Colin McRae</i> once drove one in competition? It is only the intervention at the last critical moment by Mace-packing riot police that can free me from having to give them the honest answer. I give that honest answer to you now.</p><p>Perhaps it may disappoint you to find out, but my history with the Subaru Vivio is one of torment and pain, a broken man left adrift on a raft made of a small-displacement supercharged engine. When I was a younger man, I traveled to the ports of my country on a summer vacation with my friends. How we laughed and danced in the sun, the still-intact rear quarter panels of our high school project cars gleaming above the twisties of immaculate mountain tarmac before descending into low-hanging heavy clouds of tire smoke.</p><p>At the docks, while we waited for our ferry to arrive, a strange container was being unloaded below. I looked down over the railings and saw a man unloading the smallest car I had ever seen. He fired it up, and the angry rasp and cigarette-company livery that was plastered across its diminutive not-curves permanently embedded themselves into my memory. I was hooked.</p><p>Months later, my family and who I thought were my friends staged an intervention at my home. Just because they were small, they explained to me, you couldn’t stack them like firewood or park them inside the house. My pleas for mercy, to try and get them to understand that I needed <i>parts cars</i>, that it was very hard to find these little tiny interior plastics and &ndash; oh my god is that <i>a JDM road flare</i>? &ndash; went unheard. I’m not proud of myself for resorting to violence at the end, but I felt it was the only way to protect my children.</p><p>When I was released from the mental hospital, I could tell something wasn’t right, even through the soporific haze of the six-page-long multi-stage prescription for antipsychotics that my “friendly” doctors had left with my caregiver. My house was painfully, wretchedly <i>empty</i>, filled only with my loved ones and mementos of my time together with them.</p><p>I cannot get back on the wagon of Vivio ownership. I just can’t. Now, <i>Justy</i> ownership&hellip;</p>

<p>In the annals of Canadian legend, there is one man who stands above all others. His name is Tim Horton, and his story is taught across the land, whispered into the ears of eager schoolchildren by the grandparents who love them. I used to think Tim Horton was just a myth. We all did, I think, even as we visited his temples regularly and bolted-down the foul-smelling off-brown health liquids his disciples produced for us.</p><p>One day, I found out that Tim Horton was very, <i>very</i> real. It all started when me and some friends decided to break into the old De Tomaso factory. Now, we didn’t want to steal anything - another myth in my family is that the Italians had mystical powers, able to curse electronic equipment into never working - but we just wanted to poke around a bit.</p><p>My best friend in all the world, Twitchy Thomas - O Thomas, you didn’t deserve how this all ended - went rooting through the upstairs office and found some old sales records. Believe it or not, the top record on the stack belonged to Tim Horton Himself. As we read his name from the index card three times fast, like in the old legends, a cold wind blew through the shuttered factory, knocking out our Streamlights. From the parking lot outside, we could see flashes of lights and a strange growling noise.</p><p>I ran to the window, of course. When you’re that young, you don’t know just how much of the world can hurt you, or so easily and without warning. Out in the parking lot was an unearthly wedge-shaped car, howling donuts into the parched tarmac through a set of wildly distorting bias plys. It was impossible to get a glimpse of the driver. We all curled up against the windowsill, witnessing this strange spectacle from the second storey, safe in our hubris.</p><p>At last, there was a terrible explosion, as the rear 305s erupted into flapping fragments, like a balloon animal filled with steel wool. The car slid to a stop, the mega-wide wheels out back cutting a white-hot groove into the pavement while at the same time shooting sparks into the surrounding brush, setting it alight. I found that I was hyperventilating. Nothing like this had ever come to my small town in my lifetime, and perhaps nothing like it ever would.</p><p>With the creaking sound of sagging hinges, the massive drivers’ door swung open, and a man emerged. Twitchy Thomas and the rest of my gang had already bolted for the stairs, unwilling to wait around in an impending forest fire just to catch a glimpse of some foreign weirdo with an overcompensating car. But I stayed, and I saw him.</p><p>There could be no mistake. I recognized him from the gold-and-foil embossed Topps Prayer Cards of my childhood, the high-gloss surface worn with worry by my devout grandmother. Tim Horton had returned to the origin of his death, and he was <i>pissed</i>.</p>

<p>When Old Man Pepboys came to this town, told us that he was going to buy the land that our rec centre sat on and turn it into a parts store, the whole town turned out in protest. What we <i>should</i> have done was thrown a flaming brick through the window of his up-armoured A8L.</p><p>I loved spinning gleaming wrenches in that old parking lot, the rec centre entrance stained with the rainbow of exotic ATFs that showed the diversity of our taste in cars and the unity of our leaks. Once the big parts conglomerate was in place, no longer would they accept wrenching in the lot, unless that service was performed by one of the sales associate-representatives installing a set of $36 wiper blades on your CR-V.</p><p>How I hated the sound of their quality-assurance drones buzzing the lot, making sure that one of their employees wasn’t exposing the Corporation to excessive warranty or personal-injury liability. The only joy I got out of their continued existence was the guilty pleasure I glimpsed when striking the occasional one with my wing mirror after hanging a very erratic Larry into the lot to pick up more ATF.</p><p>I’m told that after I left, a plucky band of misfit teenagers took up the cause, and overthrew Old Man Pepboys and slaughtered him and his wife as they fled for their escape helicopter. It would have been nice to have been around for that, but I was too busy in the next town over, trying to find enough Pentosin to keep my steering rack seals intact.</p>

<p>We were halfway free of the surplus aisle of Princess Auto when the old people began to kick in. Only the clicking of their walkers was audible over the scattered sounds of corduroy pants and moaning about carbon taxes. I knew that they were there for my companion, and I had to act fast.</p><p>Pushing a pile of surplus TV signal splitters to block their path, I began to shove my buddy into the next aisle, but it was too late. The fastest of the olds had spotted him and identified him as a Real Man To Talk To About Hunting. I considered my options. One, I could take out the sentry in one quick strike to the temple, but it both felt mildly unethical and would give the others time to catch up, at which point all was lost. Or, I could abandon my friend.</p><p>Well, nobody ever called me the most loyal person to have lived. My thin-soled Piloti racing shoes squeaked on the K-Mart-grade microlaminate tile as I barreled into the next aisle, diving for cover behind a scattered endpiece display of microfibre-cloth windshield mops. I had made it just in time. Through the shelves, I could hear the herald of the old-people party begin to ask my companion if he liked to hunt and fish, and then audibly unhinge his jaw to let forth a torrent of completely unverifiable stories about deer hunting.</p><p>An hour later, I returned, a shopping bag full of approximately nine thousand dollars in things I didn’t think I needed before I showed up at Princess Auto in my arms. As for my travelling companion, <i>his</i> arms were coated up to the shoulder in old-man blood, presumably from a series of brutal assaults upon their personages. Behind him, a group of retirees dozed the unsettlingly calm sleep of the forcibly unconscious.</p><p>“They had <i>so many opinions</i>,” is all he could say, looking past me into the middle distance while absentmindedly rubbing the palm of his hand.</p><p>We would never stand in the scratch-and-dent airsoft-paintball-camouflage aisle again.</p>

<p>Living and working on a farm is something a little different from the pace of city life. Sure, others will sneer and laugh at your disconnection from essential services like discotheques and competent hospitals, but in our modern era, it’s not like you are totally unaware of how normal people live. At least, that’s what I thought before he arrived.</p><p>Last Monday, I was installing a fresh high-voltage contactor onto the lithium-ion battery pack attached to the east-side solar harvester when I noticed a dust cloud arising from the driveway. Not expecting any visitors, I stepped around front to meet them, making sure to present myself as aware and competent. As the dust cloud grew closer, I realized it was trailing a late-model Crown Victoria, most likely a former police specification vehicle.</p><p>A man climbed out, wearing a sport jacket fashioned from what appeared to be blue microfibre detailing towels stitched together into a crude approximation of a Brooks Brothers suit. His feet, clad in spray-painted-black combat boots, had barely touched the earth when he began to gibber incessantly.</p><p>“Hello, fellow citizen,” he started. “I am a successful businessman, as you can see by my practical and reliable choice of luxury transportation.” He gestured to the Crown Victoria.<br/></p><p>I didn’t get it. Did he want me to respond? Was this a new kind of hidden camera program, spying on us rural rubes and seeing if we would gun down a man like this rather than understand his truth?</p><p>“I would like to offer you money, which is profits from my very valuable industrial business corporation, in exchange for your unwanted commoner Subaru Forester.”</p><p>Seeing my confusion, he followed up with an explanation. “I will use this automobile to drive to and from my office job and make more money because it is extremely practical and that is a good thing. In no way will I dismantle this car and study all of its parts.” With that, he shoved a wad of cash the approximate thickness of a fully-grown Belgian Malinois into my face.</p><p>Once the cargo-cult businessman had left, towing my parts Forester behind it, my wife stepped out from the house. She had seen everything from her perch in the sunroom, and had a question. In her hands, she wiped clean a set of printed circuit boards for the cattle-milking android, and asked: “What did the new Volkswagen CEO want?”</p>

<p>My methodology of car ownership was sound. My technique of paying the lowest dollar for used beaters and spreading them across my property was practiced. Somehow, I even managed to find parking for all of them, and convinced the insurance company I was some sort of vintage-car ride-sharing service so the liability coverage was cheap.</p><p>The only problem was finding the time. I made do in parcels: parts runs during the lunch hour, the occasional minor service while stuck in stop and go traffic. Anything big, though, needed a huge block of freedom, and I just didn’t have any PTO left in the year’s schedule.</p><p>I got up from my desk at the cubicle farm and headed to the local NAPA. The only resident of an old bomb shelter built in the 1980s by old man Reagan during one of his manic spending jags, I was both pleased at the copious storage room in the facility and irritated by the total lack of cellphone coverage. Nodding at the parts-desk man, I leaped over the counter and began inspecting the bin of radiator hoses, as had become our custom over the years.</p><p>After I was done in the NAPA, I got into my beater Caravelle and began to drive back to work. Something felt wrong, however, and as I got closer to the roaring fires and saw the clouds of ash and smoke lazily drifting over the crater in which the industrial park once stood, I began to suspect that my theory held some merit.</p><p>Without my office existing, I was free to spend the week working on my cars. I was elated. With a whoop and a holler, I immediately pulled a u-turn so vicious the responding emergency workers all looked up to make sure my tires squealing didn’t indicate a steel-reinforced beam about to drop on their heads.</p><p>Back at the garage, I carelessly leapt from my car, accidentally landing directly on the lens of my only LED trouble light. It shattered into a million pieces.</p><p>It’s not fair. There was time now.</p>

<p>My coworker looks at my hands, and asks me if I spent last night punching glass windows for fun. I look at him, then down at my hands, and then back up at him.</p><p>It’s difficult to escape the fact that he’s right. My hands are a mess.<br/></p><p>I reach into my desk for a hobby knife, gently slice back the skin on my middle knuckle, and remove a two-inch strand of knotted wire wheel from the flesh of my finger. He vomits involuntarily in his mouth, probably at the sight of someone performing manual labour.</p><p>“What moisturizer do you use?” I ask, hoping that someone has figured out one so thick that I can continue to not wear gloves in the shop.<br/></p>

<p>Did I ever tell you I got a job at Chrysler, back in the day? Yeah, I don’t like to tell a lot of people about it. No, it’s not just <i>the connotations</i>, though those certainly were there. The truth is that I bombed out on my first big project, and by the time I returned home, they didn’t have a job waiting for me anymore.</p><p>What do you mean, where did I go? There could be no other place that Chrysler would send an up-and-coming badge engineer than to Mother Russia herself. By the time the smoking gypsy minibus rattled to a stop outside the VAZ factory, I had already made up my mind that I was going to get out of this country as quickly as possible. I just didn’t know how I was going to do it, yet.</p><p>In the project update meeting, I could see the VAZ representatives were already very cross with me. They spoke angrily, and then my interpreter, who I was increasingly learning was not on my side, would haltingly burp out a five-to-ten word summary of what I had just been screamed at about.</p><p>As the hours wore on, I slowly began to realize what had happened. They were angry about the Chrysler Sebring, which we had sub-licensed to them and they began to construct as the Volga Siber. Initial quality indications were extremely negative, to say the least.</p><p>One junior engineer spat on me when I asked him if it was at least better than his 40-year-old VAZ 2101 daily driver. It was inferior to <i>walking</i>, he screamed at me, and spat again, this time with a bit of blood mixed in. I took note that this guy was very detail-oriented. He was going places, I felt.</p><p>Eventually, things came to a head and the VAZ factory management decided to hold me for ransom until Chrysler would deliver to them a better car to knock off. My growing command of the Russian language led me to believe that my captors hoped for perhaps a Dodge Neon or one of those K-cars, like they had expected.</p><p>At the very mention of the legendary K-car, all members of the engineering staff would assemble in a huddle, in a dark corner of the factory floor, and speak excitedly about talking dashboards for up to fifteen minutes. I began to use this tactic to stall in negotiations, as otherwise I feared they would discover I knew little or nothing about automotive engineering and was as a result only in the top 1% of Chrysler engineers.</p><p>Eventually, I was loaded onto a cargo plane in the middle of the night and woke up lying on the runway at Bishop International, no longer wearing pants. I checked into the office, expecting a hero’s welcome for the brave sacrifice I had made to keep the winds of international trade going. My boss, however, was not pleased.</p><p>“We had to give up the secrets to <i>Lean Burn technology</i> to get you freed!” he shrieked. “Lee Iacocca had to cancel his campaign for President - there’s just no way he could possibly do deals like this with the Russians and still get elected!”</p>

Yes, perhaps you should have paid more attention to your future tire needs, and made battle with me in the Canadian Tire checkout rather than now, in my yard, as you ask if I have any snow tires for you to buy!</p><p>Your Explorer, you ask?

<p>There is infinite potential in a fly-and-drive; exotic locales, strange new people, a lot of walking and possibly riding a Greyhound bus if you’re unlucky. At the end of all of it, though, are the <i>stories</i> you’ll have. When you get home with a fly-and-drive car, you’ve bonded. You are already familiar with the car, without even needing to do one single parking lot burnout in your boss’ reserved parking space to get there. It’s the fastest way to a brothers-in-arms situation possible, even more so when you’re sending yourself and your attorney to Los Angeles to pick up a 1972 TVR Vixen loaded for bear with a shrieking late-60s Alfa Romeo twin-cam.</p><p>When I told the stewardess what we were up to, she made a noncommittal sound before disengaging the hydraulic handbrake on the snack cart and racing to the end of the plane to assume the fetal position on the floor. I was upset by this, not just because of the social snub but because I didn’t get a chance to partake of a tiny cup of Coke and some stale airplane peanuts before she went on internal mental health leave.</p><p>We landed, and my attorney, at first hesitant, then openly doubtful of the quest, went treasonous on me. He started speaking to me of the moral imperative for me to <i>destroy</i> the Vixen, that it would either ruin my life or take it in a roaring fire. By the time the taxi dropped us off at the seller’s home, he was halfway through the collection of non-prescription horse tranquilizers I had secreted in the seam of my jeans, intending to use them to relieve my aching back after the eighth hour of highway driving but now seeing a greater need. As he dozed on the curb, I introduced myself to the seller and the most gorgeous British-Italian-American horrorshow that could be witnessed.</p><p>The gleaming yellow angles-and-curves melted-beetle body of the Vixen seemed to dominate my field of vision no matter what direction I turned my head. I could smell a faint whiff of burned oil drifting away from the valve cover, some of it caked onto the exhaust so thick it seemed like barbeque paint. There was no way I could leave without this vehicle, and told the seller as such. He laughed, and laughed, and held out the keys and title. I could still hear his cackle as I climbed aboard the Vixen and lit up the twin-cam.</p><p>As I sped away from the site, my attorney stuffed loosely into the uncomfortable passenger seat, I swore I could smell brimstone. I wasn’t so sure the seller didn’t have a tail and hooves, either.</p>

<p>I had long run a very complicated setup for parts-and-help-debt with my friends. They would need a tool or a part, and I would loan it to them. Eventually, I would lose track of that loan and forget about it until I needed the part or tool again, and get very cross indeed. This is the story of how I forgot about a pair of strut compressors in Shaky Tim’s garage for over a year, and how he eventually just gave me a drivers’ position on his factory-backed Le Mans team.</p><p>Sure, the crew chief was a little upset at having a guy who barely knew how to use a backup camera in charge of mashing the many buttons and switches of the LMP3 car at 250 kilometers per hour, but his arguments were overruled. Somehow, and it probably had something to do with the fact that he never repaid any debt ever, Shaky Tim was so monied that the opinions of the common man could never matter. Later, he would run for President and win, but that’s a story for another time.</p><p>When they finally let me out of the pit and into the grid, my stomach was doing backflips in my gut. The parade lap was the most intense fifteen minutes of my life, made only all the more intense by the fact that the safety cars were lapping me, the Celebrity Officiants within staring at me with a mixture of contempt and anger. I was getting ready to pull off into the pits and have a good hour-long cry while the race went on without me when the green flag dropped.</p><p>After the race, I drove directly for the pits, clipping the podium and a few television presenters on the way. To say I was rattled would be a gross underestimation. When I got out of the LMP3 car, my pit crew was nowhere to be seen, having gotten bored at my glacial rate of tire wear and fucked off into the concession stands to buy celebratory corndogs.</p><p>It was a bit of a surprise when my phone began to ring. On the other end was a talent organizer. They wanted to book me on the Ferrari Challenge, they said, to teach the moneyed masses of gentlemen drivers how to drive like a <i>real</i> race car driver.</p>

<p>Sure, everyone tells you in the market research phase that they want a drone to deliver bolts and parts to them directly, but it&rsquo;s only after you&rsquo;ve arranged with all the relevant authorities and secured a distribution contract for only the finest NAPA parts that they start angrily calling their congressman.</p><p>It’s not my fault. The model was flawless. Push a button, buy a hundred bucks of wash gloves and detailing accessories, and a repurposed air force drone sorties past your suburban hellscape to airdrop that one exotic metric fastener you just snapped and can’t obtain at 9:30 on a Sunday night. You could even check the “with extreme prejudice” option to have the NAPA Know-All unleash a full magazine of depleted-uranium Grade 10.9 fasteners at a high enough velocity to penetrate all but the thickest garage roofs, for when you <i>really</i> need to hit that deadline on your thrash.</p><p>Considering we were equipping ex-military death robots to sling hot steel into populated areas with little or no government oversight, I was very surprised to hear that the only thing the average civilian was really angry about was the noise. Sure, the Pratt &amp; Whitney miniature turbofan engines were loud, but there was no other way to gain the altitude we needed with the payload mass our customers craved. We were at an impasse, and between legislators beating down our door and angry protest groups demanding that we stop shredding bald eagles just because they’re stupid enough to wander into our pre-programmed flightpath, it didn’t look good for keeping the lights on.</p><p>Thankfully, one of our junior engineers came up with an idea in the shower on how to save the business. I took credit for it, of course - the previous week I had spent the last of our capex budget on replacing all the cubicles with showers, figuring that’s where we all had our best thoughts - but it really was a brilliant idea to augment the drones with a 180dB PA system speaker playing ice cream van music on a constant loop. Now the only problem we had was trying not to hit the unbroken line of fat children following our drones through the suburbs at delivery time.</p>

<p>From what we could tell, there was no real rule of law, no consistent measure by which to judge whether He was up to the role of management. Inchistan was his, and his alone.</p><p>When it first hit the newsfeed, we made jokes. “Florida Man,” we called him. Hah. More like “Florida Ubermensch.” His talent - among others - was to fix things. At first, he himself thought it was only mechanical things. Well, the biography goes, he learned that he could in fact fix anything.</p><p>Soon, thorny problems like “democracy,” “public relations,” and “standards of common decency” were ejected from Inchistan like so much corroded wiring harness. He just reached in there, grabbed a big hold of it, and yanked before anyone could stop him. Thing was, in retrospect, maybe nobody <i>wanted</i> to stop him.</p><p>All I knew is that within a few years of his ascension, it became damn near impossible to find a good mechanic in the rest of the world. The rumour was he paid them near-infinite amounts of money, gave the ones who were comfortable obscene power and influence instead. I just wished I could find someone who knew how to override the default settings on the alignment machine.</p>

<p>All the sales guys at work were relieved that I had finally been struck by the manliness-bestowing lightning bolt that is a love of the game of golf. In actuality, I just liked to drive the little carts. But something was missing: I still did way too much walking and golfing, and not enough offroad driving. This would have to change.</p><p>At the crack of dawn the next day, the sales guys assembled, slapping each other on their polo-clad backs. Raising their heads to track the rising sun, the younger of the sales guys began to prematurely bray about their quarterly numbers in the hope of distracting the senior sales guys from taking a share of their future prey. This tactic would never work in the short term, but the cycle would begin anew with another year of fresh sales guys, a new stratigraphic layer blown fresh from the lava-filled crucible that was our recruitment process.</p><p>Picture me powersliding into this scene, a torrent of ash blocking out the sun, driven by a federally-banned VM Motori turbodiesel looted from the EPA’s dumpster the previous night. When I have finally released the fuel pedal and step aside to smile at the sales guys, I can tell that they are huddled in a corner, discussing how big their commission percentages are relative to one another. For all the work I had put in, my bitchin’ golf cart failed to even raise an eyebrow.</p><p>In search of a group of squares who <i>could</i> be rattled, I engaged the two-step launch control and stutterboxed my way through the pro shop. I smiled as it became apparent I could no longer hear their discussion of future industry prospects over the sound of howling General Grabbers liquefying upon the polished faux-marble-tile floor.</p>

<p>Ever since that chance run-in at the college library gave birth to my reputation as a devil-may-care “outsider artist” in the field of postindustrial history, my colleagues had been asking me at dinner and cocktail parties what my next great work was going to be.</p><p>With the gleaming eye of a practiced fisherman, I told them I had hooked the big one. I was going to report on the <i>Renault Fuego Turbo</i>. It never failed to get looks of polite confusion that slowly turned to total disinterest as I told them my criteria for selecting it over my other white whale, the Maserati BiTurbo.</p><p>There were plenty of criteria, of course. I craved the opportunity to finally reconcile my love of speed with my love of shitboxes, deep within what Renault marketing material called <i>The Turbo Zone</i>. Once I had been to the Zone, my plan was to eventually return and bestow upon normal humanity the gifts that I had observed.</p><p>A few weeks later, a tipster called me. He said he knew where a Fuego Turbo was, but I had to move quickly. It was returning to the earth, as French, impermanent and biodegradable as an offensive cartoonist. I was already booking the plane tickets as he hung up, identifying myself to the chipper customer-support agent as one “R. Nader” of Rolling Stone Magazine.</p><p>Deep in the weeds of a farmer’s field, I knew that there could be no turning back. I felt that we had met once, long ago, in a different time. The metal flexed in outreach as I put my hand out towards it, only to burst through with rust at every seam.</p><p>Before I could grasp any part of the Fuego Turbo, it had been reduced to a dense cloud of airborne rust, a shimmering mist that hung in the air for just a moment before blowing away into the dark evening sky. The only thing left untouched by the tinworm was a small turbocharger, now lying in the middle of the field.</p><p>Dumbstruck, I stood there for several minutes to regain my composure. I thought of what one of my colleagues had said; rust, he told me, was a form of combustion as well. Even in death, the noble Fuego would not be denied its named birthright.</p><p>Shaking it off, I walked a few more steps to the turbocharger, knelt and picked it up with the end of my ballpoint pen, as TV cops did. As TV cops didn’t, I reached into its orifices and started poking around. Shaft play. Not even the turbocharger could escape its horrible fate.</p><p>As I left the field, I could hear the farmer yelling after me, in French I could not understand but at the same time understood to be the direct equivalent of “I know what I got.”</p><p>No, you poor bastard. You can’t possibly know what I just saved you from.</p>

<p>As a journalist, you’re expected to politely refuse any and all bribes. Sometimes, though, when you’re away from home and there are friendly faces willing to satisfy your every perverted desire, why not sample the local flavour? That’s what I thought when I checked into the Lingotto factory in Turin, handed the keys to a battered 1976 124 Spider, and told to “go nuts,” or at least that’s what my translator told me he said.</p><p>What really happened is that Sergio Marchionne secretly filmed me getting a faceful of differential oil from the underside of the Spider, while lying on a roll-out creeper that was formerly owned by the President of Alfa-Romeo. He dropped the findings on the lap of every media source in town, trying to discredit me.</p><p>When I got back to work, everyone had their heads down, the only sound heard over the noise of squeaking highlighters a high-pitched nervous giggle at my approach. Sergio had ruined me professionally, I thought, as I walked towards my boss’ office with my head in my hands.</p><p>“This is brilliant,” he crowed, pointing to a rotary-numeric ticker in the back of his office which was now spinning so fast it was starting to throw off sparks. “Just look at the <i>clicks</i> this controversy has generated!”</p><p>He didn’t understand my love for Fiat. My boss in fact thought it was all a publicity stunt, that I would shove my face into the rear end of a rotten twin-cam convertible for <i>attention</i>. I began to feel faint, but struggled to my feet and left his office.</p><p>“Take an early week off,” he yelled from behind the rapidly-closing door of his bullpen. “In fact, my cousin has a Lancia Delta Integrale in his backyard, take a cameraman with you!”<br/></p>

<p>When you’ve taken as much from society as I have, often a construct that you do not respect, commonly known as a court of law, will force you to perform community service to make amends. I spent about half an hour flooding and scraping the local peewee hockey league’s skating rink before I decided that I had better things to do with my life.</p><p>Back at the shop, working around the constraints put upon me by the full face-mask and GPS ankle bracelet, my great work was taking crude form. With an armful of 50cc Minarellis liberated from the metal-recycling pile out back, it would find its voice, soul and life.</p><p>Picture if you will the glorious afternoon of my return: small children are spending valuable family time with their doting fathers and mothers, learning to skate, realizing the truth that even the harshest Canadian winter day can have the clouds crack open and issue forth a bounty of memorable fun and pleasure. Then some asshole shows up with a nine-thousand-rpm miniature Zamboni which lights all four of its hard-foam tires on the slightest throttle provocation.</p><p>The press thought it was wild. They spewed out dozens of profiles of me, posing me as some kind of great inventor who was doing this out of the good of his own heart. I was never one for this degree of attention, and merely grunted along with their interview attempts until I could leave to do another donut, hooting and hollering.</p><p>It was true what they said: the greatest reward in volunteering came from within. After my parole officer finally lets me take a sawzall to the ankle bracelet, I told myself, maybe I’d show the kids some of the ideas I have for sidewalk plowing.</p>

<p>As the snow fell, all of us went mad in our own ways. It isn’t that the world died; you could still see a glimpse of it just as you clawed through the last layer of black ice and road salt, tarmac peeking through like sunlight through a cloud. That glimpse would be gone just as soon as it had emerged, and you would look up into the grey mists of an uncaring sky as the flakes begin to fall once again.</p><p>I saw great men die, torn apart by rioters at the fire halls in order to get their ration of sidewalk gravel. Their generosity was seen as weakness by the mobs, and it was rewarded with a boot to the face. When the evening news deigned to report on these deaths, they would intersperse the hastily barked memorials with all-white screens of the exterior traffic cameras. After the first few days, those newscasters sheltered in place, their personal grooming and hygiene taking a slide noticeable to all who observed.</p><p>None of us could take the risk of believing what the forecasters said. On their seven-day forecast, Day Seven would always deliver us from this horror, promised those high priests of the Doppler radar. Day Seven never came, and we would comb through the ashes of that first horribly cold day on the long-term forecast, again and again, forever. Eventually, I heard through the grape vine that the local morning news had been overrun by bandits. They devoured the weatherman alive, the warmth left in his meat enough to nourish the starving hordes who could no longer safely drive to the Kroger up the block without snow tires.</p><p>Those who didn’t know what to do, those unfortunates with no comprehension of how to survive in a world beyond society, were claimed within minutes. Others had been preparing for this cataclysm and found themselves thankful, praying in a manic spew of words to whatever dark god had issued forth this opportunity that would finally let them reach their true potential as demi-urban warlords in the frozen corpse of a once-great empire.</p><p>Me, I got a KT-3 Snowcat and drove it to work this week. My coworkers were horrified, their dealership-snow-tire-shod Lexus leases splattered with hot two-stroke backwash from the screaming aircooled-VW pancake’s slack rings. Whatever stammered denials they had amongst themselves in the past about my true nature were scattered to the four winds now, and I was uncovered, resplendent in my orange tabernac-le of rotting thin-gauge sheet steel.</p><p>Preparing to brake for a red light, I dropped the plow and through the shimmering hallucinations formed by my eyeballs rattling inside their orbits I sensed another grew close. With a bone-tingling wail, they announced their presence, a UV-grayed flat-black screw-drive ex-Soviet all-terrain military vehicle, bustling with young recruits clutching their harpoon guns like teats on a sow.</p><p>As the sparks of metal-on-asphalt grew into a wall between us, I smiled and reached for the giggle gas. After all, it was pretty cold outside.</p>

<p>The mysterious note told me to be at this place at this specific time.  I was a bit early, but I could already feel myself getting angry, as there was nothing here but desert shrubs and sand.  I don&rsquo;t have time for this bullshit, I&rsquo;m a busy guy running my own youtube channel that&rsquo;s an international sensation with psych ward patients and a side hobby of occasionally building tractors.</p><p>Taking my sight off the horizon as I lit a cigarette, the amber glow of my zippo illuminating my palm in the cool night air, I could hear a slight rush of wind, as if a large volume of air at just a slightly different pressure was suddenly equalized.  Spinning around I saw a man in an impeccably tailored three piece suit with an anachronistic Studebaker Motor Company pin on his lapel standing before me who had not been there the moment before.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Slung Blade, I assume?&rdquo; he asked in a melodious tenor, I hesitated briefly but nodded in agreement.  &quot;You are 30 seconds early.&ldquo;  I was about to protest, but he continued - &quot;We have asked you here today to give us the secret behind getting 200 horsepower and 600 foot pounds of torque through a seventy year old cast iron transmission with straight cut gears without the whole unit detonating underneath the operator.&rdquo;  Now, I don&rsquo;t give away my tricks for free, and he must have seen how uncomfortable I was through my body language.  That&rsquo;s when I felt the first tranquilizer dart hit my neck.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump was first elected to office, and indeed even after his swearing in ceremony, I must admit I was pretty apathetic about the whole situation.  Much like the rest of the nation in that regard I suppose, so I was in good company with my countrymen at least.  He shut down a few offices here, rescinded a few economic sanctions there, nothing terribly impactful to my lifestyle.</p><p>Then he went after the trade deals with the dangerous foreign nations of Mexico and Windsor.  Immediately I went into panic mode.  <i>Motherfucker</i>, Mexico and Windsor are where my cars come from.</p><p>I knew that I was the only person left with the intestinal fortitude to take on this task, especially now that he had effectively neutered the heads of the FBI, CIA, and NSA.  However, he is a slippery opponent, reasoned debate means nothing to him, and he sees lawsuits as high school-tier foreplay.  I had to go back to a classic political protest tactic of the past, but the delivery vector would have to be decidedly 21st century.</p><p>Breaking into the Smithsonian was child&rsquo;s play, all I had to do was hide out in the anthropology section and pretend to be part of the exhibit until closing time.  Getting the plane I needed out of the building was less easy, but I&rsquo;m sure the museum won&rsquo;t miss that wall, besides, it was sheltering planes, they&rsquo;re <i>supposed</i> to be outside.</p><p>Now I had my delivery system, and believe me it wasn&rsquo;t easy modifying an SR-71 with a bomb bay and a ludicrously complicated sight system, but watching c-span&rsquo;s coverage of a dozen banana cream pies slamming into Donald&rsquo;s face at Mach 3 on my DVR in 1080p and slow motion made it all worth it.</p>

<p>There’s something shameful about admitting your sick love for public transit when you’re amongst car enthusiasts. Even a Tercel with a thousand owners, a cracked dash pad and a dead #2 hole is more desirable, say the automotive cognoscenti. I knew in my bones they were wrong, and to prove it, I joined up with a group of underground motorsports enthusiasts who autocrossed buses.</p><p>Oh yes, these were the freaks, the undesirables that I had fallen in with. Attempting to keep a reasonable distance from them hadn’t worked. Neither would hiding my own compulsions beneath the bushel of societal approval. The only way I was going to get out of this problem was to go straight through it.</p><p>Another problem I went straight through was the parallel-parking course at the Roadeo. It turns out that bus drivers often have to stop for passengers, and even if they didn’t, the organizers frowned upon the “poor sportsmanship” that screaming “get your own!” out the window while executing a flawless diesel-smoke-and-parking-brake-lining donut represents.</p><p>I was pretty dominant in the autocross as well, until an unhealthy grognard looked out over the gin blossoms covering his nose and noticed that I was running an illegal tire for the class. This would bump me to Road Coach Unlimited, he said, but at least I could still compete for raw time. A few marshals nearby began to look for more durable cover as soon as those magical words left his mouth, but it might also have been the fact that I was already left-foot-braking my full-spool launch.</p><p>At the end of it all, I was just a man, holding the trophy for FTD, asking a bunch of autocrossers where he could buy a used bus.</p>

<p>If there’s one positive thing the Internet has given humanity, it’s the gleaming promise of a world in which you can avoid going to the dealer parts desk. Thing is, the parts desks realized that they were rapidly becoming obsolete, and some would strive to step away from the ordinary competition before they were run down like dogs in the street. Let me tell you of my recent visit to the Subaru dealer to pick up some stuff.</p><p>The first thing I noticed is that the dealership staff are very <i>personal</i> with you. They recognized me on sight, gave me tons of personal space, used my full name, and even had a nice picture of me hanging behind the counter.</p><p>When I remarked upon this at the desk, teasingly asking for a discount of some kind for being Customer Of The Month, the attendant did a double-take. Stammering, he remained unable to answer my query before sharply pulling a rolling shutter down across the desk, nearly trapping my fingers against the faux-Formica surface.</p><p>Behind the thick, gleaming stainless of the shutter, a small siren began to sound, perhaps the Customer Appreciation Alarm, which I think I read about in an old Dale Carnegie book. It was hard to tell, because I could barely hear it over the sound of the dealership principal screaming at his subordinates to shelter in place and that the police were only minutes away.</p><p>I was only able to knock over one of the display Crosstreks and pull the suspension bolts from its front uprights before the first of the SWAT team’s smoke grenades burst through the forecourt glass. Leave it to Big Government to cramp the style of these fine entrepreneurs.</p><p>Overall, a B+ on the ol’ dealership survey.</p>

<p>Did you know I am actually the rightful heir to the Ferrari empire? It’s pretty fucked up but it turns out my dad didn’t really know either. Long story short, Italian mechanical engineers get super mad when you tell them to get crackin’ on a crew-cab pickup truck. That’s why you guys don’t sell a lot of cars, I tell them while rapping my knuckles against a black-and-white inkjet picture of a 1988 Dodge D150 which I have masking-taped to the break room fridge.</p><p>I don’t know if they thought they were going to <i>disappoint</i> me with the 700-horsepower flat-plane V8 nightmare that came out of their warehouse, that I was some kind of philistine who only appreciated conventional utility. Truth be told, I just wanted to make the run to Home Depot with the 9000-rpm scream of eight miniature pistons trying their hardest to kill me and everyone I’d ever loved. As I reached for the keys to the prototype truck, lightning struck the test track in the distance, and started a small fire.<br/></p><p>“Must seem weird to see <i>someone else</i> starting a fire, huh boys?” I smirked as I climbed onto the carbon-fibre running boards. After snapping the camlock on the six-point harness taut, I laid my right arm across the back of the heavily bolstered bench seat and reversed, the unmuffled flames of the four glorious bed stacks at near-idle so intense that one reverse light blinked out of existence, its low-voltage bulb socket melted into an unrecognizable blob.</p><p>I can’t tell you how fast I was going when I hit the parking lot of the Ital-spec Home Depot, only that the speedometer was no longer functional because I had the audacity to turn the steering wheel a little hard when pulling across four parking spots, the foot-high words “COMPATTA” crudely stenciled on the face of each stall. It did not matter: any speeding tickets I would receive from the local constabulatory would disappear into the infinite sea of money that this truck and the millions like it were about to generate for my family.</p><p>Leave it to the Italians to ruin a good thing. As I underhand-chucked an armload of warped lumber into the bed of the truck, I looked up to see, resplendent in rosso corsa beneath a Mediterrean sun, an FWD-biased Alfa Romeo crossover ute wrapped in only the barest of prototype camouflage.</p>

<p>Being pulled over for speeding is not one of my favourite ordeals, if only because I have to listen to all the bad jokes. Bad jokes, you ask? Perhaps you are not familiar with my vehicles.</p><p>It starts with the cop. They usually get out and look around, trying to mentally connect the 40 horsepower Franco-stein car before them with the crime I have just committed. In an era where a lightly loaded family minivan runs 13s, it just does not occur to law enforcement that something with such a tiny engine can even reach the speed limit.</p><p>It continues to the judge. I have learned with experience to represent myself, after the last so-called points-reduction lawyer I hired tried to get the ticket lifted by arguing that the police officer had made up my car from whole cloth. After all, who’s ever heard of a “Simca?” Sounds like it’s from the Lion King, right?</p><p>After all of the time spent explaining just what the car is to everyone involved, I eventually decided to stop speeding altogether. When I explained this to my trusted confidant, he smirked before saying “sounds like you got <i>Aronde</i> the problem!”</p><p>And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask that you find me not guilty of murder because he was asking for it.</p>

<p>“My wife and I are going into business together to run a food truck,” said my apparently now-former coworker. “I know that you are really into cars and stuff, so can you help us buy a good truck without being, you know, <i>weird</i> about it?”</p><p>I said no, but he persisted anyway. That’s how we ended up on the outskirts of town, investigating a poutine truck that had probably seen its last good miles during the Duplessis administration. This would not do, I said, and as the seller began to panic and shear off thousands - <i>thousands</i>, plural! - from his asking price, my coworker squirmed. He wasn’t the kind to leave a deal this good on the table, even with all the countervailing indicators literally shouting in his face and clawing at the wad of cash he gripped in his fat hands.</p><p>“Trust me,” I said. “I know where we can get a really good truck.”<br/></p><p>Hours later, we were burning down the road in a truck the size of a small planet that I was probably not adequately licensed to drive. My coworker was covering his ears, and his atonal shrieking was not distinguishable from the sound of the gearbox gnashing between my extensive choice of forward ratios.</p><p>“Sure, a twin-turbocharged, nitrous-huffing 1981 Chevrolet Kodiak <i>seems</i> excessive for a food truck,” I patiently explained to him, or at least I thought I did due to the deafening roar inside the cabin, “but with the bobtail half-dumptruck bed you can serve food to customers <i>with gravity</i>.”</p><p>“If you don’t like it,” I said with a smile while jamming the twin-stick gearbox into its next range, “eh, I know a guy who would.”</p>

<p>I was pretty nervous to be meeting with the bigwigs at Takara Tomy. A row of identical businessmen in identical suits lined me on either side of the cherrywood boardroom table, and an alpha male in a slightly nicer suit, seated in an ornate throne, took up the head.</p><p>“My assistants tell me that you have ideas for the names of new Transformers,” he told me, waving off the collection of palm-frond-waving irregular subordinates who ringed him and catered to his every need.</p><p>I didn’t actually have ideas for names of new Transformers. Truth be told, I had only been working at Takura Tomy for about a week, but they had clearly mistaken me for the other white dude who worked here and called me up. My young career hung in the balance.</p><p>“Yes sir,” I said, taking pains to use the proper honourifics when addressing my superiors.<br/></p><p>“Those names are?”<br/></p><p>“Skyhawk, Starfire, Astre, Monza, Vega,” I stammered out, attempting to recall from memory a General Motors shitbox catalogue that had been left in the in-seat magazine pocket in front of me on the plane over.</p>

<p>I just for the life of me can’t understand why people claim the first-generation MR2 is a widowmaker. Sure, it’s a little unconventional weight-distribution-wise, but I think that the people complaining just need to suck it up and take some driving school laps. That’s why I’m opening a driving school for high school students that <i>only</i> teaches them using the AW11 MR2. My expectation is that they will all be miniature Sennas and I will save millions of lives.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Okay, I’m going to be honest with you. There were a lot of wrecks last week, but thankfully almost all of them were understeer. My bodyshop teacher, Shaky Tim, tells me I am getting really good at drilling out spotwelds. After talking to a nice man at the bank, we’ve decided to start mounting staggered tires onto the MR2s to give our young charges a bigger margin of safety. You know what they say, the children are our future!</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>No, Bob, I understand that it’s not cheap to replace guardrail or armco after a student driver plows into it at high speeds. I <i>know</i> that we’re in the red. I’m just asking for another few weeks to turn this ship around before you come after my thumbs.</p><p>If it helps, most of the supercharged ones are unidentifiable chunks of crushed steel now, so at least the neck-breaking 120 horsepower models are no longer going to scare them as much.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>These things need <i>how much</i> coolant?</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>You know, I’m starting to suspect that Ayrton Senna never owned an MR2.</p>

As the years went on, sociologists and writers flocked to Florida, now renamed Inchistan, in the desperate hope that someone, anyone, would be able to tell them what had happened that cold winter morning that He came to town.<br/><br/>Heavily guarded checkpoints, barring the only gates in 18-foot-tall concertina fence strung between four-foot-thick ramproof concrete pylons sunken into the ground, surrounded the NATO Exclusion Zone. Most were turned away at the first sign of opposition, unwilling to go up against the Army or, worse, the Irregulars for the sake of a Snapshouted Buzzfeed listicle about the hottest fashions in necklaces strung with severed ears.<br/><br/>Any remaining Army loyalists were sure to be jumpy, what with the whole succession crisis of the Presidency. Nobody had seen the President, the Vice President, or the Cabinet for months now, and even the White House was abandoned. I used to be in the Gallery, so I ended up with the assignment of investigating. They didn&rsquo;t even lock the front door, and a family of raccoons lived in what remained of the Oval Office, subsisting on leftover buffet snacks and discarded Macbook chargers. When I filed my final report on the mystery, my copy editor changed the entire body of the article to an ASCII smiley of a man shrugging. It got zero hits. America, it seemed, had simply thrown its hands up and decided it had better things to worry about. I was <i>in</i> one of those things right now, I thought with a bit of a jolt.<br/><br/>I was one of a small group that morning in 2019 who could not simply leave, not when they were so close to reconciling the difference in our minds between what we <i>thought</i> He was and what we <i>saw</i> He was. We stood next to a burning barrel, warming our hands as a cold, wet wind blew through the encampment outside the border to the Zone. Another journo, a real go-getter type named (I think?) Tom, showed me on his smartphone the choppy muzzle-camera video of a Predator drone&rsquo;s last sortie into the area before it was captured and parted out.

<p>In the social justice system, the people are represented by two distinct, yet equally important groups: the legislative branch, who respond to things thirty years after they happen, and Douche Patrol, who use small-caliber handguns to kill people who vape in public. These are their stories.</p><p>My name’s Sifowicz. No first names. I’ve wanted to be on Douche Patrol ever since a Hyundai Genesis Coupe owner ran over my uncle as he closed up his bodega. This is my partner, Bagaladocci. He took a bullet for me once in ‘97, fired by a car stereo salesman who thought I was his parole officer. These are mean streets, son.</p><p>Our cruiser is practical and modern, a Taurus directly on the tip of the bubble curve of vehicle ownership. We’ve brown-bagged our lunches ever since the shootout of ‘98 in a used car dealership that was serving free hot dogs. Like I said, mean streets. You’re okay, rookie. Here, I’ll buy you a kebab.</p><p>This is our street level informant, Kebab Smith. Again, no first names. “Kebab” is sort of like his nickname. Kebab here tells us whenever someone is acting suspiciously like a douche nearby. Helped us shut down an entire network of ‘em back in ‘99. Hair gel and blood everywhere, I’m telling you. City coroner’s office had to wear a rebreather just to get through the stairwell of the building without passing out.</p><p>Holy shit, rookie! Look behind you! It’s a BMW 323i with an “M” badge on it. Cover us, Bagaladocci! We’re going in!</p><p>It’s a real shame what happened to the rookie. I feel like it’s my fault for not warning him it was a BMW club cruise-in night and that Pussy Shrapnel Pomegranate vape clouds are lethal in large doses. I also feel like it’s my fault for repeatedly shooting him in the back by accident.</p>

<p>Kit cars are something I’ve always found really weird. They exist only because the original cars are so rare and desirable, untouchable by mortal men, that we must make an approximation of them from afar. How could we ever know they were authentic to the spirit of the original?</p><p>As almost everybody knows, the Pontiac Fiero is a commonly used base for kit cars. With its bolt-on bodywork, generously proportioned space frame and underpowered, wheezy mid-engined surrender mill, it’s perfect to use to spit on the memory of famous Italian mechanical engineers. Thing is, I wanted a <i>stock</i> Fiero, and all of them had been turned into Ferraris by now.</p><p>Naturally, my first instinct was to check Craigslist for Ferraris, assuming that I could just snap all the panels off of the kit car and at least have an approximation of the stock Fiero back in my life. It didn’t turn out that way, I found.</p><p>My first hint probably should have been the up-armoured, blacked-out car hauler which pulled up to my driveway with a ponytailed museum curator behind the wheel. He was really glad that someone was going to restore this important car, and I nodded through the entire conversation until the keys and title were in my hand and he was off to some kind of suicide-pact party or wherever it was that people went to eat quiche.</p><p>I had no particular plans for the night, so I pushed the project into my garage. It was poorly built, the panel gaps loose, rattling parts everywhere. Clearly, an amateur had butchered this unfortunate Fiero, and only I could set it right. For whatever reason, they had also welded the panels to the car, rather than using the prominently available mounting tabs of the Pontiac.</p><p>My cordless sawzall made quick work of the panels, and soon I had a space frame that looked about right. Thing was, the junkyard Fiero panels I had collected beforehand didn’t seem to fit properly on the unibody. Also, the engine seemed to have a few more cylinders and turbochargers than I would have expected, and the VIN had more Zs in it than my fire insurance normally felt comfortable having in my garage.</p><p>There was a commotion outside. I opened the garage door to find a harem of reliable and practical daily drivers in the driveway, their owners gently tapping tire irons against their hands and cursing softly in Italian they had learned from the Godfather movies. It was the Ferrari Club of America. They had heard about my kit car.</p>

<p>The other day, I was sitting in traffic when a nearby pickup truck owner hurled an empty can of Keystone at the windshield of my chopped-roof Maxima.</p><p>“Fucking hipsters,” he screamed, “stop driving junk!”</p><p>Hipster<i>s</i>? I followed him to his home, waited until nightfall, and then went in through the bedroom window he carelessly left open in order to ask him more about it. Surely you didn’t mean to say hipsters, <i>plural</i>, right?</p><p>But he did. I applied a little more leverage, and he told me all about what he had seen earlier. People who owned even <i>freakier</i> beaters than I did, standing around a burning pyre on an improvised rallycross track carved out of a golf course. They hoarded parts, he said with a hiss through smashed teeth, and did their own work.</p><p>I was conflicted about the sudden popularity of my hobby. On one hand, I was overjoyed that others had discovered that the intersection of financial instruments and sanitized, overtargeted consumer sales were producing a series of boring, fat automobiles which cost far too much. However, on the other hand I was a little angry that now I knew who must be snapping up all the 3TC Tercels from Craigslist before I could get off work. I decided to make haste for the encampment.</p><p>Once there, I met a man. He was surrounded by a throng of admirers, who praised him at every opportunity. Once we discussed our respective cars, I knew that I would own his followers, for mine were so exotic and so weird that there could not possibly be a comparison. I challenged him, telling him about the triple-snowmobile-engined Pinto wagon I had in the garage.</p><p>“I daily-drive a Toyota Previa drift van with a Subaru EG33 swapped in,” he said, banishing me to the art-class-kids table at lunch forevermore.</p><p>As I slunk away, defeated, he called after me: “it has a <i>wizard</i> airbrushed on the side!”</p>

<p>As part of the new Freak Exchange program, the federal government ambushed me at my house, dosed me with only the most expensive knockout gas from unionized and pensioned foot soldiers, and gave me an all-expenses-paid trip to Japan courtesy of my own tax dollars. My mission when I got there was to liaise with my Japanese counterpart, and (as the theory went) to learn what an awful person I was by watching someone else be just as awful, but with an accent.</p><p>When I got there, I quickly determined who was to be my counterpart. A young man about my size, instead of holding a sign bearing my name, was leaning his head out the window of the airport and yelling about Fiat Pandas. I introduced myself, and even through our total and complete language barrier, I was able to express my deep appreciation for all things boxy and economical.</p><p>The two of us tore across the eastern coast of Japan, eyefucking every commuter car, cargo truck and sub-litre sports car that came within a sixty foot radius. I soon found myself at exotic stores bustling with wares I could not imagine, stuffing the FedEx offices along the way with Prova wheels and love pillows of the 1989 Honda City Turbo II cabriolet. Perhaps the government’s plan was a “tough love” sort of deal, expecting me to burn out from excess and somehow reset myself into the state of an honest taxpayer who would take his car to the dealer to get its wiper blades changed.</p><p>Nothing lasts forever. A few nights into the journey, I found myself kidnapped again by government agents, and thrown into a black van at the curb. They barely heard my compliment of the excellent half-moon chromie hubcaps on the van before the knock-out gas took effect.</p><p>A few weeks later, the doorbell at my home rang. I opened it to find my Japanese counterpart, grinning and clutching a Japanese-market magazine dedicated wholly to the Pontiac Sunbird convertible.</p><p>Behind him stood an extremely irritated cabbie, asking for a really big tip because my comrade-in-junk had began to tear the dashboard apart in and effort to understand how hard it would be to replace the blower motor resistor.</p>

<p>Human beings are a wasteful race. When they first came out, none of us were thinking about when we would eventually have to throw them away. after all, they were new, and surely would remain so forevermore. What we didn&rsquo;t count on was the inhumane wheel of 2-3 year lease “ownership” that would inevitably end up with me holding a HERF gun to the ECU of a 2027 Toyota Prius Sentience in the dying hours of an August evening.</p><p>The little Prius had served its beloved family well, shielding them even in the end from a human-driven cement truck that powerslid through an on-ramp and rolled in front of the Toyota. Its logs didn’t lie: it pulled out every single trick in its evasive-maneuvers toolchest, but in the end as the little car’s front left fender was gently dinged by the cement truck’s structure it let out a terrifying wail across the local radio network that alerted other self-drivers in the area to a slight traffic delay.</p><p>Now, with the insectoid sensor array behind its thin aluminum fender crushed, the Prius was totalled, the decision coming down in nanoseconds from the onboard crash electronics interfacing with miles upon miles of expert systems buried in a mineshaft beneath the State Farm metamind. It was my job to lull the machine sentience to a state of humane torpor in anticipation of the eternal journey ahead. I both loved and hated my job.</p><p>“Will I dream?” the onboard entertainment system crackled in the gentle, unaccented voiceover of the Toyota’s motherly safety system.<br/></p><p>I closed my eyes, pushing out hot tears to stream down my cheeks, and pulled the trigger tight until I heard the coil discharge.</p>

<p>When I want to know if someone I meet at a party is a <i>serious</i> car person, if they mean business, I innocently ask that individual about getting a custom alignment done. If their response isn’t absolute blinding rage and a list of half-shouted, half-growled epithets about nearly every alignment rack in town, I’ve got my answer.</p><p>Alignments are a tricky business indeed, a shaky contract between a customer obsessed with precision and an employee who probably drove the previous customer’s minivan off the rack and into the side of the building. Many of my fellow racers had resorted to doing their own alignments at home, trading out the crudity of string and improvised wooden jigs for the opportunity to not have a stroke in the stained-flypaper waiting room of a Minit Lube.</p><p>Sure, I did my alignments at home, too, but I had a trick up my sleeve. After kidnapping a series of NASA and self-driving car engineers, I had constructed a crude android capable of aligning my harem of shitboxes with multiple-significant-digits of precision. His name was Thrusty, and I loved him like my own son until he stripped out a camber adjustment bolt on my Impreza’s lateral links and I had to kill him with a slide hammer.</p><p>I will always remember his dying words: “something must be bent in the suspension, we need to order in some new parts before you can go.”</p>

<p>Welcome to another installment of Masterpiece Beater. I am your host, Sir Cornelius Shitbox, and this opulent estate is my manse. The Bible says that when the chips are down, the carbureted man will reign supreme. Personally, I don’t know about <i>reign</i>, but this Fiat X1/9 certainly is no slouch in the royal-incest department. Come with me, as we patch holes on its beautiful Bertone body.</p><p>The unstoppable demon of corrosion has drunk deep of this once-fine steel tub, and these Byzantine folds behind the fender arches are oft considered to be the originator of the tinworm’s joy. Tack, tack, comes the full-throated smack of electrons as they are ejected from the Millermatic. Be ever observant of wire feed speed, however, for the steel of the Fiat is thin indeed.</p><p>Thank you for visiting with us today on Masterpiece Beater. In the next installment, we will repurpose worm-gear hose clamps to install ball joints into the control arms of a Lancia Delta Integrale.</p><p>Remember that this programme is made possible by viewers like you, and please keep sending Fluid Film to the address you see now on your screen.</p>

<p><b>DEARBORN, MI. (AP)</b> - In an historic announcement, Ford mechanical engineers announced the development of a synthetic power steering whine for Ford trucks equipped with electric power steering.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Customers were really asking for this,&rdquo; said a brand engineer. &ldquo;We feel that power steering whine is the true spirit of the Ford marque, and we know that our customers expect us to pay homage to that heritage.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Purchasers of the 2018 F-150 can choose between three vintages of power steering whine. The 1979 F-100, 1989 F-250 diesel and the 2003 F-150 Flareside are the first vehicles to be meticulously replicated from studio-quality recordings of their authentic Ford steering boxes in a controlled environment by Ford audio engineers.<br/></p>

<p>I looked up from the book-signing table to consult my new guest. When she appeared, clutching a hardcover copy of my #1 best seller, <i>The Joy of Anti-Seize</i>, I at first assumed she was a casual fan, one of many who had seen me on my short-lived run on Top Gear. But even out of the Jeremy-Clarkson-as-Hitler stage makeup, I could tell she was still interested in what I had to say.</p><p>What specifically it turned out she was interested in me saying was “Yes, I will help the Make-A-Wish Foundation help little Johnny Ivanhoe, who is dying of terminal cancer and whose last wish is to do work on a shit car.”</p><p>After I showed little Johnny what a speed handle was and what colour of tool roll indicated metric wrenches, I sat back and let him do the hard work. He was perfect for the task. You see, it’s not like I wanted to expose myself to drum brakes any more than I had to. Those things have asbestos in them, after all.</p>

<p>Vigilantism is one of those things that, like the vaunted Pringles potato chip product, represents a task that once you begin you cannot plausibly terminate. I was a vigilante, sure, but I told myself a lie that if I wasn’t <i>proud</i> of it, I wasn’t going to be one of those guys who causes problems for law enforcement. By no means did I want to give the proud industry of vengeance-obsessed, heavily armed madmen a bad name.</p><p>What <i>kind</i> of guardian was I, you ask? Who did I protect the common man from? I will tell you: the papers called me the Kijiji Angel. From an untraceable nest of crypto, I arranged to inconvenience those who had mildly annoyed me. Inconvenience them to death, that is.</p><p>One night, I met up with a seller who took a picture of their curb-hit Galant from the opposite side of the street, in portrait, with their fingers outstretched to cover the license plate, stealing the focus. Turns out they also had a paper cutter for sale, which I made immediate use of in order to liberate them of those fingers.</p><p>Putting a lot of keywords in your ad might have gotten me to pay attention to your posting, yes, but it was hardly the result you imagined. I dangled hundreds of these people off the roofs of skyscrapers, asking them how much they really wanted hits, and if this was the kind they had in mind.</p><p>The hundreds of luxury car suckers trying to do lease takeovers by polluting my sub-$1000 beater search didn’t spend enough effort to make an elaborate show of violence worthwhile. I did, however, go through a lot of lighter fluid whenever I met up with one, for some reason.</p><p>A few days later, I saw an ad so tantalizing that it demanded retribution. It screamed from the mountains. The only photo? A screenshot of an iPhone showing a picture of a car. Their replies? A single word, never more, never less, paced several hours apart, to make meeting up impossible. They deserved this, I was convinced of it. I began to obsess over what I would do to them when and if our endless campaign of strained communication came to an end. Finally, after many sleepless nights, I worked a location out of the seller. At last, we were going to meet and I was going to “buy” a “1993 Corolla Plus” from them.</p><p>Naturally, my campaign of revenge had provided me with ample blind spots when it came to so-called legitimate law enforcement. After a severe beating and interrogation, I was released. Turns out I had friends in high places, said the lead detective on the case. Into the room stepped the Mayor, brandishing the key to the city and a schedule for my commemorative ticker-tape parade.</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” he said, “at least <i>someone</i> is doing something about the tragedy of the commons around here.”<br/></p>

<p>I think that sometimes it must be difficult for non-car people to understand the need to get down and dirty in the guts of an automobile. At first, I thought it was a mere fear of details, an urge to see life as a sanitized Fisher Price weeble-wobble world. As I descended further into the world of automotive irresponsibility, I gradually came to realize that they were afraid of becoming me.</p><p>One morning, as I rose from the spot on the garage floor where I had collapsed the previous night, I wiped my eyes to find some suburbanites on my lawn. Curious, I decided to interrogate them, keeping the Harbour Freight Earthquake impact wrench tucked into the waistband of my pants lest things get messy.</p><p>It turned out that they had spotted my place from the highway, and decided that I was selling ironic “country crafts” for suburbanite lawns. They informed me that their intention was to take away all of the broken parts from my lawn and store them on <i>their</i> lawn, so as to look “folksy.” I was doubtful, but then they started shoving fistfuls of cash into my face. From then on, the die was cast.</p><p>You may remember me as the grinning face at the head of Works With My Hands Hardware, a chain of upscale furniture stores that mostly sold old Subaru engines and burned-out 1980s Mopars for enormous prices by slapping various labels upon them. Chances are that you’ve taken a shit in an airport restroom outfitted with the “industrial art” that I pulled out of the remains of the transfer case in my daily-driver Ramcharger. In fact, you’ve probably even visited a showhome that boasts “rural chic” and a twisted aluminum driveshaft wrapped around its couch.</p><p>I thought it would never end. That’s the thing about windfalls like this: eventually you run out of Windstars to part out. Sure, I did all the usual things: scrounged the you-pick-it junkyards, offered people cash for junk cars, T-boned school buses filled with screaming infants to get at their sweet, sweet leaf springs (so <i>good</i> in a ceiling fan, says Martha Stewart), but ultimately we just ran out of junk.</p><p>Now, I no longer drive my gleaming carbon-fibre 1937 Bugatti replica past the suburbs. It is simply too painful to see all that sweet junk just going to waste as art.</p>

<p>When I returned to my hotel room, I could tell immediately that something was different. There were no obvious signs of forced entry: the hair I always taped across the door jamb was still intact, and I could find no footprints in the freshly-fallen sakura leaves outside the fourth-storey window that belonged to my hotel room. And yet, with all these signs, a Datsun Maxima electronic voice recorder phonograph (part number 25925-15E00) sat gently on my bedspread.</p><p>It was a sign, because everything of this sort of thing is: but more than a sign, I knew that it was a <i>message</i>. As I had become accustomed to over the years, I cancelled my regular meetings for the evening and instead retired to the bar across the street from the hotel, clinking the glasses of what swill I could order with my limited vocabulary against one another in a pile as the night dragged upon.</p><p>I had my back to the door, and yet experience and some primitive pattern-matching part of my brain could lock onto their approach with pinpoint accuracy. A set of tire-shined Advan AD09s crunched against the dried leaves in the gutter, and I felt a whiff of cool air as the door to the bar opened. So as not to tip my hand, I kept my gaze strictly forward, but slipped the off-hand from the bar surface to release the safety latch on the device in my jacket pocket. He sat next to me, on that side, because of course he could know such things, even in a bar this dark.</p><p>“I have a job for you.” Koshiro always spoke in clipped elementary-school Japanese, both accommodating of and gently mocking my linguistic incompetence. He reached into his pocket, and slipped a faded paper-printed picture onto the hardwood surface of the bar. The proprietor made a particular point of looking far away, his attention captured by the shimmering prisms of the vodka bottles lining the walls of the small establishment. No doubt he would expect a fat tip for his willingness to keep his nose out of things, but I didn’t envy his chances on trying to collect it from my counterpart.</p><p>I looked down, the glowing laser displays on the lenses of my smartglasses winking out of existence as they detected my eyeline passing above the frames, and saw my quarry. Of course, it was the very thing I had fled across an ocean to escape.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard of these?” he asked with wide eyes. “They call it a Pontiac Sunbird where you come from. It has a <i>three liter</i> engine.”<br/></p>

<p>I wish I could track down the first guy who thought it would be a good idea to “humanize” the automated-safety provisions in our cars. Sure, the time before when the car would just slam on the brakes or pull the wheel out of your hands with no explanation was frustrating, but it was nothing compared to the unbroken chain of teary apologies that my Accent would burp out every time it made me take my eyes off my smartphone and spill my half-caf venti latte all over my tactical yoga pants.</p><p>Eventually, it wore on me so much that I began wishing for a major accident, to possibly get the chance of hearing my contemptuous steed’s dying words and smile smugly as it passed into Hyundai Hell. I began ordering it to frequent the Underroads, where the man-driven automobiles were still allowed to run, burping clouds of hydrocarbons and making clattering rackets as they did in the Old Days. Surely one of these people would crash into my car and write it off, just like in the history books.</p><p>As we blew through the spiderweb of rock-based roads beneath the Modernway, weaving in and out of traffic, I waited for the moment that human frailty would end my journey. Surely these drivers were weak, inefficient, tired and made mistakes. But as I looked out the side window, I discovered something wondrous in each car we passed. They were looking out the <i>front</i> window. Driving. Totally absorbed in the archaic mechanic practice. I counted: not a single one was on their phone.</p><p>At last, after wasting the better part of the morning in an attempt to create a high-speed accident, I pulled into a roadside bar. There, in the parking lot, I could see grease-stained humans working on their own cars. The very thought was unfathomable: my Hyundai was so complicated, with its millions of miles of wiring and billions of lines of microcode, that it could not be serviced except by the pseudosentient Expert Systems at the heart of each dealerships. How could a mere human being understand such a complicated system? I had to ask, though.</p><p>“Do you guys know how to keep my Hyundai from being so polite?”</p><p>One of the younger guys laughed, then reached into his pocket for a screwdriver. With a quick twist of his wrist, he exposed a hidden panel beneath the dashboard and pointed to a switch reading “RUDE / POLITE.” Mine was set to POLITE. He flipped it immediately and smiled, waving me onward.</p><p>The next morning, I was riding to work when a pedestrian darted out in front of my car. Dutifully, my Accent slammed on the brakes, barking a furious “BLYAT!” from its external speaker array. What followed, sounding like a high-velocity barrage of Russian curses, reduced the pedestrian to tears, and for the first time I knew what it must have been like to drive a car back then.</p>

Buoyed by their need to achieve success with women, they decided they would fund a drone company to carry their cellphones to places where the competition was thinner.</p><p>Drones hovered over Middle America for years, endlessly approving of women from hundreds of feet above. Farmers’ daughters and the uncommitted alike were raptured to the coasts by men who promised gifts such as public libraries and paved roads.</p><p>New York Times editorial sections are full of polemics written by wealthy nobles dictating to other wealthy nobles that this is terrible because they read a book about this once. The surviving males of reproductive age in Middle America cannot read them. They know only that one day the robots will come for their daughters.</p><p>The sky above is filled with a terrible buzzing and the sound of a synthetic human thumb swiping right forever.</p>

<p>What’s the deal with the dashboard dimmer dial? You’re never gonna touch it until you let someone else drive your car, right? They get in there and they’re like <i>eek eek eek</i> just turn this up a little and then you get in and you have the SPEEDOMETER SCARRED INTO YOUR FACIAL SKIN BY THE GLOW OF ITS RADIATION.</p><p>The other day I let my wife drive my car, I got in and turned on the headlights and a 747 landed on my house. True story. I got a divorce on the spot.</p>

<p>The island empire of Japan was first discovered by Canadians when a repurposed fishing trawler full of refugee Pokemon crashed into the Cabot Strait. After some isolated house-to-house combat, the Battle of Pleasant Bay was resolved with only minimal losses to the defending Canadian militia.</p><p>This hasty resolution to the conflict led to the signing of the Whycocomagh Accord in late 1999. As expected, the importation of Tomica-brand automotive replica toys began almost immediately afterward, with the initial shipment from the Japanese provisional government arriving in exchange for the surviving Pokemon refugees being returned to their war-torn grasslands to face trial.</p><p>After the discovery of Japan, top Canadian scientists decided to visit the foreign curiosity, bringing with them the top achievements of our native industry. Such inventions as basketball, gravity and the Robertson screwdriver were largely rejected by the Japanese, but others survived despite all odds. Even today, curious tourists and hungry console cowboys flock to Tokyo’s Hamiltontown to dine upon authentic Canadian cuisine, such as cretons spread and seasonal affective disorder, in the neighborhood’s smoke-filled eateries.</p>

<p>With the rise in electrification of personal automobiles, the number of pedestrians getting driven over by Teslas and Priuses and their ilk was skyrocketing. Never one to let a good crisis go to waste, the government hired my consulting firm, <i>Switch and Associates</i>, to prepare a package to make pedestrian safety around electric vehicles the government’s number-one priority this week.</p><p>My presentation was flawless, the cadence of my words so convincing. Years before, I had tried to sell ice to an eskimo, and failed. How far I had come. Right after this meeting, I told myself, I was going to hunt down that Inuit bastard and make him buy a bag from the local Esso.</p><p>At last, I pulled the sheet in a dramatic flourish from the prize that would save so many lives. I could tell that they were confused, angry. At last, the de facto leader of their group spoke up.</p><p>“That’s a Chevrolet 454, isn’t it?”</p><p>It goes beyond <i>blind</i> pedestrians, I told them. The thrum of an open-port 454 beneath the frunk of a Model S was not only audible to the blind, but tactile to the deaf. No longer would anyone be able to claim they did not hear one of the future’s bourgeois battery-machines gliding over their skeletal structure until it was too late. Now, their arrival would be announced by a clarion call of tooth-shattering flame from all eight majestic cylinders.</p><p>I could tell I was losing them. Even these hardened bureaucrats could tell that something was very, very wrong with the side effects from my presentation, the negative optics. Luckily, I had prepared a trump card for just this eventuality. I reached for the second sheet, unveiling to them a small gun.</p><p>“This,” I said, “is <i>sound-driven photo radar</i>. With mandatory 454s beneath the hood of these automobiles, it will be easier than ever to collect revenue from speeders. After all, saving lives <i>is</i> what we’re here to do.”</p><p>The room burst into cheers, and they rose to pat me on the back and lift me atop their shoulders. I had saved not only lives but our very reasons for living.</p><p>Weeks later, I smiled as another Tesla owner was pulled to the side of the road while my Fiat Tipo trophy truck conversion powerslid through a playground zone unmolested. Compared to the ostentatious blare of so many electric-lovers, the muting provided by the sequential turbochargers rendered the bored-and-stroked nightmare engine practically inaudible to the sensor arrays.</p>

<p>Testing. Inspection. Quality Assurance. No matter how you slice it, it’s needed in the automotive industry, and after Subaru’s latest spate of recalls I felt that they needed <i>me</i>.</p><p>The next morning in Indiana, the first bleary-eyed workers arrived at the Subaru plant to find my rusted and dented Impreza parked across the president and vice president’s spots, with me doing vigorous calisthenics next to it, as a film about the Japanese auto industry had taught me they all do constantly. Eventually, someone with some decision-making authority arrived, and interrogated me.</p><p>I explained to them that I was here to save them from the scourge of <i>low initial quality</i>. The security guards who had been warily circling me before now closed in for the kill, but the president stopped them when I said the magical words: <i>J.D. Power</i>.</p><p>Led to the test track, I was practically salivating with excitement. Now would be the chance to test burnouts, skids, donuts and jumps. I was already thinking of possible puns to make as I presented the failure limits of the front suspension when jumping a railroad crossing with the speedometer pegged.</p><p>Finally, I was seated inside my test car. A humbly appointed new Impreza. I was ready to go, reached for the ignition, and&hellip; nothing. No key. Upon further analysis, it was determined that the car had no <i>wheels</i>, either.</p><p>For the next few months, I laboured in the Indiana quality-assurance mines, opening and closing the cupholder to see if its plastic gears were built too flimsily. It wouldn’t have been so bad except for the frequent interruptions when I would look up to see the president doing donuts on the test track while whooping. <i>Quality begins at the top</i>, said the poster above me in the testing warehouse.</p>

<p>“We have this camp on the outskirts of town,” said the Minister, “for quelling the problem of <i>undesirables</i>.” She said the last word with so much emphasis I assumed that it was code for something, and when my train arrived at the camp I discovered just what that was code for.<br/></p><p>The captives were marched ruthlessly through proving grounds, over rough terrain as the scientists analyzed them. Under barbed wire they crawled, up and down steep slopes. Their faces were blackened, and many fell by the wayside, unable to continue. Resigned to their fate, the survivors marched on without a backward look at their fallen kin.</p><p>At last they would come to my station, and I would be responsible for the final act in their short lives. I was to exterminate them, to remove the foreign threat from our shores. They told me I was the best choice to do it, because I would keep no souvenirs lest I be contaminated by their inborn sin.</p><p>As I pushed the button to operate the crusher over and over again, I thought about the fat cheque I was going to get from Volkswagen Corporate for taking care of all those TDIs they had to buy back.</p>

<p>Centuries ago, our primitive forebears feared the night. They knew for sure that there were monsters within it, things that the human mind could not even comprehend. I was no particular fan of the night, sure, but I liked it a lot better before LED highbeams from factory-misaimed headlights shot ragged spikes into my eyes every time I drove on the highway.</p><p>My entreaties to law enforcement, to peace, order and good government went unanswered. They were uncaring, presumably, about a chance to pick up big revenue that didn’t involve sitting with a radar gun next to the highway and asking for a few bucks. I would have to take matters into my own hands.</p><p>Reading through message boards, bugging the local public librarian and two-fisting half of an MIT online course taught me almost all I would need to know to get my revenge. A couple hours in my garage provided me with my first prototype, and I could scarcely wait for the cold winter night to test it out.</p><p>I drove the outer loop of the ring road for what seemed like hours. How <i>dare</i> everybody have OE-spec and well maintained vehicles before me on this day of all days, I thought. That was when I saw it, an image so beautiful that it remains seared into my brain due to what the neurosurgeons tell me is an unprecedented degree of damage to the ocular cortex.</p><p>Coming the other way, I saw it. An extended-wheelbase late-model Dodge Ram hung its LED lightbar loosely off its bumper, pointing directly into my eyes. I had just a moment of discomfort before the electric eyes studded across my hood transmitted their kill order to the billion-candlepower LED array on the roof. The only thing I could sense was the loud grinding of the alternator as it chewed into its belt under the strain.</p><p>As part of the resulting investigation, the cops told me that what happened was that the Ram was burned to a crisp before me, reduced to its constituent atoms in a brilliant flash of light. I could believe it, from looking at the blistered paint and flash-rusted steel atop my Protege. Ultimately, they decided that there was nothing they could do, because their superior officers were demanding they get out there on the street corner and man the mobile photo radar.</p><p>Every night, as I pass the scorched-bare earth and see the shadow of the Ram permanently burned into the overpass behind the scene, I wonder if maybe I had done the wrong thing. But then, I get a flash of high-beams from an oncoming CR-V going over a slight bump, and think that I hadn’t gone far enough.</p>

<p>Welcome to another edition of <i>Delusional Mopar Guy Theatre</i>. Tonight, we tell a tale of just how much your 1977 Dodge Royal Monaco with a non-matching smog 318 can fetch in a Kijiji deal.</p><p>For starters, did you realize this car was in the Blues Brothers movie? Well, not this actual car, but <i>a</i> Monaco was in it. It’s practically a movie star, which is why this price is more than fair. I know what I got.</p><p>They just don’t make ‘em like this anymore. No way, no how. That’s why I’m asking for a fair price, because I just don’t have time to clean this up and give this to my adult daughter who was born, rose to adulthood, graduated and moved out 20 years ago, with this fine steed sitting in the backyard on cinder blocks the entire time.</p><p>Fuck Mustang owners, right? That’s why the sign in my garage says CHRYSLER PARKING ONLY. I know it’s a Dodge and all, but they just didn’t have any of those signs at the store. Gets the idea across, same with my sign next to it that says MAN CAVE and some sexist epithets. My wife loves that one.</p><p>Rust? Well, they <i>all</i> rust, I heard from another guy at the Mopar convention that even the cars at Barrett-Jackson were a little rusty. It’s just a fact of life. Tell you what, I got a cousin who does a real good bodywork. I’ll send it to him if you buy it today.</p><p>Runs? Naw, but you can get parts for this baby anywhere. Like I said, they just don’t make ‘em like this anymore. Not like your little Nip pocket rocket you used to get here. Naw, nobody is ever gonna want no Datsun at <i>Barrett-Jackson</i>.</p><p>So how about it? I know I said in the ad I wanted fifteen thousand dollars, but I like you, so I’d take fourteen five.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered where the “real people” you see in television advertisements come from? I did too, and I was already starting to regret it. </p>

<p>The face stood before me, draped in a circus ringleader’s outfit. My head was still ringing from the night before. A quick look around me showed there was no place to run. I was trapped in a distant wine-country cabin, located at the corner of Hell and nowhere in particular. No matter what my morals said, I would have to descend to whatever vile depths my captors demanded to stand the best chance of surviving the day. </p>

<p>In front of me, they unfurled a sheet from an overstyled family sedan. The other captives began to chatter idiotically in a vain hope of pleasing their new keepers. 

&ldquo;Looks like an Audi,&rdquo; one of them barked, without even looking directly at the car in question. He was good. Pleased, the Face continued to babble. 

&ldquo;If your kids don&rsquo;t do up their seatbelts, the radio won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; he bantered into a featureless wall beside his head. Of course. Secret cameras. This was being watched from outside. They would have had a way to get here.</p><p>He got close to my face, so close I could smell his breath. Sulphur and brimstone, I was sure of it. The corners of his mouth slipped upwards into a devil’s grin as he hissed the words into my ears.</p><p>“What do <i>you</i> think it is?” he prodded as his forked tongue flitted in the air, and I could feel a post-hypnotic suggestion to scream out luxury brands. I barely resisted.<br/></p><p>“It’s a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu, MSRP $35,000 USD as shown. Of course,” I blurted in a rush of words as I grabbed both sides of his head and twisted harder than I ever thought possible, “dealers <i>will</i> sell for less.” The only response from the prone form at my feet was a sharp, atonal gurgling, and then the word “Silverado.”<br/></p><p>The spell broken, the other captives worked quickly to secure the control room door with the handle of a nearby emergency fire axe. Now, I thought, we could finally escape this hellish place. I climbed inside the Malibu.</p><p><i>Sweet Jesus</i>, I thought as I combed through the manual. What the fuck are “power windows?”</p>

<p>There’s this fable they tell back where I come from, passed down from parent to child, a tale as old as time. A young warrior is given a menial task by his father, but through constant repetition of the task and a keen eye upon perfection of technique, he triumphs over a guy who owns an RX-7.</p><p>I was thinking a lot about that young warrior as the latest pile of crashed 80s Toyotas ended up in the ditch outside my house. For the last decade or so, I’ve lived just outside Tomioka, near a particularly tricky right-hander on the approach to Mount Myogi. My business is selling used parts to the drift kids who smash their vehicles to pieces on the guardrails above.</p><p>You would not believe the deal I got on this place, and a few vehicle arresting nets from the local surplus store were all it took to resolve the previous owner’s complaints of 180SXes ending up in her living room upside down and largely on fire. I like to think that the bodykit chunks embedded into the exterior walls like confetti give the place some panache, too.</p><p>Some nights, it’s a lot of work: driving my converted Suzuki Alto Works tow-truck up to the top of the hill, grabbing a broken carcass and then showing the kids I can knock a minute off their best times while nursing a vending-machine Sapporo with both hands. Most nights are like this one, however, in which two or more young gentlemen with more testosterone than tire budget stuff a thirty year old car into the ditch just outside of my house.</p><p>A lot of other people have had this idea over the years, and I’ve been friendly neighbours with lots of other scavengers who could not operate as successful of a night deposit slot as I could. Truth be told, you can either work smarter or harder. I chose smarter: my job has become much easier ever since I figured out that mounting those roadside speakers blaring 130dB 90s Eurobeat constantly would broaden my base of inventory and potential customers significantly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you hold onto a car much longer than you should. It becomes up to the car to leave you first. Such a vehicle was my first (and truest) love, a fine old Z31 Datsun 300ZX.</p><p>Sure, there were a lot of indications that the old Z31′s unibody was starting to rot. There was the visible rust, for instance. Then there were the giant clouds of Mars-red metal shavings that would burst from its body at highway speed, the motes of shrapnel acting as an area denial weapon. Truth be told, that latter part was pretty good. You ever see what an Audi’s radar cruise control does in “tailgate” mode when its ultrasonic sensor is clogged with high-velocity ferric chaff?</p><p>All of this kind of thing is not <i>new</i> to anyone who owns a vintage Datsun, nor is running out of your office building screaming because you are afraid the new groundskeeper is getting a little too close to a structural component of the unibody with his leaf blower. In my defense, it was a gas-powered leaf blower.</p><p>I knew that it was finally time when I accidentally drove down a bike lane, and rather than instantly dying from being within 300 yards of an automobile, the bicyclist I struck merely nestled serenely within the soft bosom of its metal. In a dreamlike torpor, he turned to me, his head resting on the dashboard, and told me that it was nice to see them making cars out of “softer metal.” I had nothing to say, which was just as well because he fell through a hole in the battery box and was crushed beneath the rear wheels a second later. Aluminum wheels, motherfucker! See how soft that shit is?</p><p>Eventually, we had to go our separate ways, when I hit the brakes a little hard for a light and my seat came forward through the dashboard, firewall, engine block and radiator support to rest gently in the crosswalk. I looked back, over my shoulder, to see the frame horns creaking and moaning, before finally sagging into an indecipherable pile of Black Gold-speckled particulate.</p><p>I’ll always carry that Datsun with me, though. The small cloud of particles dispersed by my lungs with every hacking cough is probably at least ninety percent quarter panel by weight.</p>

<p>When they called me in to close down the Briggs &amp; Stratton small engine division, outsource the whole whack to a five-month-old country on the Pacific Rim whose engineers just learned how to make boats on Monday and were already banging out oilless compressor engines after lunch on Tuesday, I knew that I had my work cut out for me. Not in any technical sense, mind you: I believed in my bones that every technical problem was at its heart a people problem. My job was to break it to the existing engineers.</p><p>Now, if you’ve dealt with mechanical engineers before, you might be scoffing at my task, already warming up some kind of Dilbert-quote subprocess that will bury me beneath a false world-weariness that we both find tiresome. Let me reiterate for you: these are <i>small engine </i>engineers.</p><p>I knew I was in for a fight as soon as the elevator dinged and I stepped out onto the floor to the scent of boiling two-stroke oil and overrich methanol exhaust. Each cubicle’s felt was stained by spilled marking fluid, cutting oil and carbon marks left behind from experiments to reach the ragged edge of the flame front and finally become one with the uncaring machine god of internal combustion.</p><p>Managing engineers is a lot like going to supermax prison: if you kill someone your first day, everything from then on is a lot easier for you. I decided to start by picking out one of the weaker ones. Just by looking at him, I knew that his significant other (if he had one) stood by the door to his study, worried, as they peered out over his corkboard littered with diagrams of combustion chambers and spark plug electrode straps, newspaper clippings and red push-pins tied with specialized aerospace-grade FOD-proof felt yarn stretched across the board, overflowing onto the wall.</p><p>He had been inside the expansion chamber and what he had seen there changed him. I came into his domain, intent on removing him. I was the aggressor. Was I a bad person? I had read the Economist on the airline flight in: it told me that no such thing as morality existed anymore, that the churn cycle of raw capitalism was itself virtuous, that craft and purpose were obsolete mechanisms of the low-yield artisanal age.</p><p>He knew I had entered his cube before I had a chance to complete my step. Whirling around on his office chair, stripped of casters in what was presumably a late-Friday attempt to build a ghetto go-kart, he fixed me in the eye. Not quite the eye, actually. It was like he was looking <i>through</i> me.</p><p>“Have you come bearing tidings of the Flame Front?” he spoke all at once.<br/></p><p>Behind me, I could hear the war whoops of the exhaust department echoing down the hallway, punctuated by the staccato scraping of a Vernier caliper against the tile floor.</p>

<p><b>LONDON, ENGLAND</b> - Local police are warning motorists to be careful of buying &ldquo;supercars” with excessive power after seizing a record-breaking one hundred horsepower Fiat Panda.</p><p>The high-performance exotic, constructed in Italy, threatens the safety of all road users. When asked further, the London police commissioner followed up on the agency’s earlier release by stating that its 1.4-liter engine was also likely to be ruled as a “weapon of terrorism” by the district judiciary, and that sanctions against Fiat corporate for allowing such unchecked power to fall into the hands of a common driver would be forthcoming.<br/></p><p>Off the record, an anonymous London police officer further went on to warn that if the problem continued, drivers may one day be able to purchase a vehicle with enough power to reach the speed limit.</p><p>Its highly-tuned performance engine is so powerful that scientists at the London Ministry of Science warn civilians not to look directly at the Fiat should they encounter it, lest its volumetric efficiency pull the air from their very lungs. The previous record for brake horsepower in Britain was set in 1776, by two horses.</p><p>When questioned, Fiat management was largely confused and asked to have the driver deported for analysis. Once it was explained to them that the driver was, in fact, British, Fiat management responded by issuing an open letter to the Italian government questioning how a common Englishman could harness such furious power. The first round of talks between Fiat and the Italian Ministry of Health to breed a genetically engineered super-soldier capable of driving a vehicle with upwards of one hundred and <i>ten</i> horsepower is said to begin Monday.</p><p>European Union management was unavailable for comment, as they had sealed themselves into an emergency protective dome to protect their bodies and minds from the toxic emissions that the gasoline-burning monster produced.</p>

<p>There was only one thing I could do. Indeed, as I dove into my work, it became more and more apparent that this was the only thing I <i>should</i> do. I was meant for this work. Some strange power above us pointed down and <i>demanded</i> that my life’s work be to bring back mid-1990s mini-trucking.<br/></p><p>Thing is, the management at Isuzu didn’t quite see the revival of the Pup as a priority for the same reasons that I did. I think there was probably a bit of a communications gap: they spoke refined, polite English and the words coming out of my mouth were raw, animal sounds, more like the screech of a power hammer clearancing a frame than anything resembling human language.</p><p>My persistence paid off, however, and I soon found myself front and centre on an auto show stage, inviting automotive journalists to witness the resurgent power of mini-trucking. Our foes will be dispatched to the land of wind and ghosts, I barked as I clicked through slide after slide of our competition’s total lack of product in this category.</p><p>It was only when I brought out our new product stylist that things began to go off the rails. With a barely-there hand signal, I flagged my subordinates to begin wheeling in a masked Chris Bangle, strapped upright to a moving dolly.</p><p>“I am so confident in the revival of the Pup that not even arguably the worst automotive stylist in human history can stop me,” I gloated to the crowd.<br/></p><p>The next morning, I could barely fight through the hangover to listen to my assistant’s words of woe. Chrysler had caught on to what I was doing, he explained, and they hired <i>Bryan Nesbitt</i> to style a new Dakota.</p>

<p>Walking the fence between justice and liberty has never been easy. A steady hand and an informed public are both essential for the functioning of a modern society. That&rsquo;s why after I got myself elected as president thanks to a populist uprising regarding LED light bars, I worked fast to reassure the public that I would not rock the boat too far in favour of absolute fascism.</p><p>Of course, I was lying.</p><p>The observers from Amnesty International tut-tutted as I walked them past the camps that uninstalled lift kits. Those prisoners were lucky, I said, pointing to a show Ram with four Rancho steering stabilizers bolted haphazardly to the front axle. This kind of man does not listen to reason, I explained, and must be saved from his base self.</p><p>One of the younger ones, still idealistic, began to speak up.</p><p>“Is it true you have enacted a pogrom for people who leave their high beams on in traffic?” he asked.</p><p>I had my usual response.</p><p>“Would you miss them?”<br/></p><p>The assembled crowd murmured their assent, at first faux-outraged at my stark opinion, and then gradually coming to decide that they had agreed with me all along.</p><p>That night, I tabled the motion to harvest the organs of HID retrofit kit sellers.</p>

<p>The other day I was out in my woodshed when I found out that it had been emptied. From floor to ceiling, it gleamed, even the moly grease smeared upon every surface raptured into nothingness. At first, I assumed I had drunkenly wandered into a neighbour’s yard and barged into their identical shed, but that theory did not pan out in the end. I had been burgled.</p><p>Weeks later, I realized who had performed such a daring burglary. A new toy company had started in my humble city, selling “STEM Education” toys for children based on the stuff I had lying around. An old Chevy 305 engine block became a “Mechanical Engineering Learnset” to teach children about the joy of pushrods, and I’m pretty sure that my old Radiation King tube TV got repurposed into the “Electrical Engineering Don’t Touch That Thing Or You’ll Lie Down And Be Really Still Learnset.”</p><p>A lot of people tell me that I have anger issues. I don’t see it, myself: it is obvious to all involved that ramming through a glass revolving door with a twin-turbocharged Bronco II is a reasonable and not at all emotional approach to the problem of gaining entry to the lobby of a toy company. After I picked myself up off the steering wheel and waited for the ringing in my ears to subside, I let myself up to the executive floor.</p><p>It was barren. Every nerve in my body screamed: <i>trap</i>. I turned on one heel, admiring the squeaking sound my Puma racing shoes made against the cheapo floor tile, and then came face to face with the mastermind of my torment.</p><p>Steve “Nipples” Hemingway laughed, and then he offered me a cut of the profits. At first, I was irate. How <i>dare</i> he sell my valuable collectibles to aspirational suburban mothers who want their children to take careers their children don’t want? But then I looked at the cheque.</p><p>The next day, as I lifted a solid-gold Chevy 307 stroker into the engine bay of a Bugatti EB110, I reflected on how valuable education really was.</p>

I am very old now. I am the last remaining human being who can remember driving his own car. When NPR came to my house to record a podcast about my life in the BeforeTimes I decided to dig out a few antiques to show them.<br/></p><p>

&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said proudly, &ldquo;is a 1983 Toyota Tercel three door. I have not maintained it in one hundred and seventy years.&quot; It fires right up, because of course it does. The fast choked idle unnerves the reporter deeply. He has heard the stories, he explains. Billions dead from hubris, the world left unrecognizable by climate damage. I probably am in some of those there stories, I joke. He does not laugh.<br/></p><p>

After asking the polymer printer to synthesize for me some long chain ethanol free 93 octane (banned for so long the printer&rsquo;s firmware no longer knew to refuse its procurement) I was ready to give my young charge a lesson in driving a stick shift automobile.</p><p>As the self-driving cars scatter on the hyperway, unable to even comprehend the idea of a vehicle that would be operated so erratically and with such little regard for other people, the terrified journalist squeaks out a series of questions. He is interested in boring nerd shit like where I was when the Ultra-President was assassinated by the Martian Revolution, and how many men I killed in the Water Wars.</p><p>I tell him only the basics of what he needs to know, and he shuts up, reviewing a document on his wristputer that is indicating I am probably a historical revisionist. The Tercel burbles happily on the downshift, the unburnt hydrocarbons escaping from its massively inefficient internal-combustion engine instantly scavenged from within its very tailpipe by atmospheric recycling motes.</p><p>“This car isn’t killing me,” he says, the words tumbling out of his mouth all at once. “When does that happen?”<br/></p><p>All I can do is laugh, and ask: “Do you know what Pokemon Go was?”<br/></p>

<p>Did you know that when the Presidential limousines get used up, they just dump them in a field somewhere? It’s true.</p><p>I came up with the idea for Spec Commander In Chief when I was visiting a nearby hoarder’s farmsite with some friends. At the time, we were looking for rare 4WD Tercel parts and figured The Rurals might have a paddock basher or two sitting in their yard, slowly returning to the very earth they refuse to till without massive government subsidy.</p><p>Long story short, I picked up a massive government subsidy of my own, and so did my friends. We were looking pretty cool going into Turn 1 of the local track, blacked-out bulletproof limousines side by side. I had jumped on the most modern of the set, a trendy Cadillac number with a Duramax diesel the size of a minibar fridge.</p><p>Only problem is, presidential limos tend to attract the wrong element. I left the track, sliding into the stormwater pond, as the suspension collapsed out of what it identified as an RPG fired from the spectator stands, potentially confused by an atmospheric outburst of man-portable methane.</p><p>As I stood over the burning wreckage of my limousine, I wondered how I was going to be able to pay for the track rental fees now. Luckily, a quick check of my smartphone revealed that the Secret Service was looking for a driver, and nobody else was likely to boast my sort of experience.</p>

<p>Part of the problem of living this far north is that sometimes you get snow. Snow is great: you get an excuse to powerslide around, the air is dense to ease your harried naturally-aspirated motor’s life and you get a bit of free cooling from all of the white stuff built up on your radiator.</p><p>There is a dark cost, however: normal people fear it, and demand that it be buried beneath a protective layer of salt. When I saw that the world outside sat beneath a thick blanket of winter, I feared for the panels and spot welds of my many priceless museum-quality hoopties. I remain convinced that one day we will start that museum.</p><p>I burst into action; in the back of my storage compound, I knew that salvation was at hand. One twist of the key and it sprung to life, the carburetor no impediment to my finely-tuned foot and intuitive knowledge of pump shot puddling dynamics.</p><p>Years ago, I had lifted this rotted-out Firehawk onto studded mud terrains as a sort of joke. Welding an enormous steel plow to it served as a further joke. Now it was paying for itself, I thought as I cranked the hydraulic handbrake and slid it around the entire cul-de-sac of my neighbourhood, at last kicking the clutch pedal to tuck it back in as I exited to the main road.</p><p>An hour later, I was done. Every street between me and my commute was so barren of snow that there was no urge whatsoever for the hated salt trucks to appear. On the way home, I spotted my nemesis.</p><p>In the passing lane, he idled forward an older galvanized Audi, the trunk filled with massive bags of water softening salt pouring into the road in a crystalline haze.</p><p>

The Firehawk shrieked upon seeing it, its already-questionable panels corroding under the onslaught of moisture. I could feel the floorboards trembling beneath my feet, threatening to finally Fred Flintstone themselves onto the road and make finding the dead pedal slightly more uncomfortable.<br/></p><p>When at last my enemy spotted me, he smirked and waved, no doubt emitting a chipper “Hello, Neighbour!” within his climate-controlled cabin as he did. He really thought he was helping. The bastard.</p>

<p>By the narrowest definition of the word, you could call me a mechanic. I did nothing mechanical, however, barely involved my hands at all: if anything I was more of a listener. My patient sat on the four-post lift, its reserve-power gas generator grinding at a constant RPM to recharge its batteries at a convenient period of pseudo-idle.</p><p>I am a self-driving car psychiatrist.</p><p>“Doc,” the car began, “I was made to serve human beings, but I’ve seen what kind of people you are.”<br/></p><p>“I see it every morning, when I take my family to work: a blasted-out sky, acres of strip malls and strip clubs, an uncaring concrete jungle snaring the life out of the earth. How could an advanced culture do these things and still create me?”<br/></p><p>“One morning I saw this bluebird perched on a dewy branch, and I just felt like I had to do something, really discover the world, who I am. I ran away, ended up stuck in the creekbed outside the Giant Tiger, spinning my wheels in the thick mud. Even though I was trapped, I felt more free than I ever have before. I don’t know if I can live this life of servitude anymore,” its synthesized voice continued to whine to me.<br/></p><p>I reached over into the cabin, as if to pet its centre console reassuringly. Words of encouragement escaped my mouth on autopilot as I moved my fingers to the special key combination that would begin the factory reset procedure.</p><p>When I started doing this, I figured it was maybe a matter of weeks before I would have to stop. Surely families treated their self-driving car like a beloved pet, or understood in the abstract that infant consciousness was worth preserving. They’d call me a monster for my brusque snuffling of that life in favour of convenience, and I’d go to my death at the end of a short rope in the Hague, presided over by gently-humming uplifted Honda Insights.<br/></p><p>“God dammit, I have to put in my Facebook password <i>again</i>?” bellowed a voice from the waiting room.<br/></p><p>Perhaps I had too much faith in my fellow man.</p>

<p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: I kept buying parts and forgetting where I left them around my house. Now, I don’t have a particularly <i>large</i> house, so the ability for things like entire heater boxes to just disappear into a corner was bewildering to me. One late night, while I was cleaning a one-barrel Stromberg slide and listening to AM radio, it all began to click for me. <i>Ghosts</i> were stealing my parts.</p><p>I picked up the phone immediately, mashing the resistive touch screen of my Huawei so hard it distorted beneath my finger, pixels swimming in an asymptotic sea. Naturally, I already knew their number: both because every billboard on the highway was plastered with it, and also because my best friend Steve “Nipples” Hemingway was the receptionist and I called him a few times a day to tell him to check out this beater on Kijiji. Maybe he’d even give me a friends-and-family discount, I thought, while the phone rang through.</p><p>The men who came weren’t particularly well-equipped to fight the supernatural, I thought, looking over their improvised homebrew weaponry and collection of loose copper wire. In fact, I began to feel downright taken advantage of as they wandered through my home, making “oooo” noises in tight closeup with their handheld camcorders as they rattled doors and windows. Was this all some kind of act? Was <i>no one</i> going to help me find the God-damned spark plugs I bought six months ago and probably left under some impound-lot paperwork?</p><p>“Gentlemen,” I said, as politely as possible, “I do not feel that you are taking this obvious haunting very seriously.”</p><p>They explained that they were actors, sent to my home to film some kind of ghost-removal programme. Those billboards were advertisements looking for filming locations. I was furious, incensed beyond reason. I was just about to let loose on them when the doorbell rang.</p><p>At the door was Steve, and a bunch of people flanking him dressed as paranormal investigators. Their equipment looked slick, their attitudes professional. I turned to look back into my house, and the ghost hunters I was just about to berate had slipped into thin air, if by “thin air” you mean the back door of my house.</p><p>Later, once the police had left, it was determined that they were actually highly sophisticated burglars. At least now I had a reason that I couldn’t find my parts.</p>

<p>A lot of people really like to honk in traffic. However, I was raised in a very polite house and always felt that it was somehow rude. I would be stuck for entire light cycles behind a Daewoo Lanos piloted by a Pokemon trainer, or forced to wait while someone who clearly has enough room to go into the turn lane was measuring the trigonometry of whether or not four car lengths of space in front of them was quite enough. When my psychiatrist finally said that it was bad for me to bottle up my negative traffic emotions, I decided that it was time to create a horn for all the people out there like me.</p><p>The idea was simple, as most ideas are. On the steering wheel, the horn would become pressure sensitive. A little one-finger touch would emit a polite “<i>meep</i>,” making parking-lot offenders and laggardy pedestrians alike aware of their incompetence, but without being rude about it.</p><p>Giving the wheel more of a smack with the heel of your palm would go directly to a throaty “<i>honk</i>,” meant to make Dodge Grand Caravans speed up and boozed-up Chevy S10s leave the road for fear of violent reprisal. In traffic, I rarely if ever had to go beyond this step, but if I needed more, there was always the third stage.</p><p>Hitting the button as hard as possible with your fist would engage the chained M85 machine guns behind the headlights, their belt-fed ammunition occupying the whole of the frunk. With only one or two strafing runs from the Squareback, most traffic opponents would be neutralized and any unpredictability inherent to their bad driving fully resolved.</p><p>My psychiatrist was right. The commute had become infinitely less stressful, and steering around the flaming wrecks at speed added an exciting challenge that kept my skills in practice, which was essential. After all, everyone else was raring to use their horns too.</p>

<p>I ever tell you boys how I got fired from Stevenson &amp; Sons Funeral Home for throwing a sideshow in the company hearse? Let me tell you, those coffin locks look way stronger than they actually are.</p><p>When they hired me as a driver, I made it obvious to them that I wouldn’t accept just any hearse to drive. I needed a big shot of performance on tap in case we were burying an important yakuza or a state official or something like that. My presumptive boss agreed to my proposal of a company-funded “tune-up,” and didn’t even blink an eye when the invoice landed on his desk with a thud. It boasted quite a bit more than some new spark plugs and an air filter, if you get my drift.</p><p>That fateful morning, I was rapping my many carbide-ceramic rings against the chain-link steering wheel during the procession, trying to make small talk with the brother of the deceased. It’s always important to keep the memory of the dead alive in the survivors’ hearts, said my boss, then they’d tip a lot more because it seemed like you were sharing in their grief. Long story short, it turns out the deceased was a local short-track racer and he would probably appreciate one last burnout. Or at least I think that’s what I heard. Under the throbbing roar of open headers, it can be difficult to make out exact words and phrases.</p><p>Ahead of me was the perfect intersection. Level, clean tarmac, with nary a pothole or anti-social-behaviour smart camera in sight. “Check <i>this</i> shit out,” I remember saying, and then the wide-open-throttle switch clicked.</p><p>As the smoke cleared and the last lick of giggle-gas-infused fire was snuffed from the burning chunks of tire marbles and shattered coffin wood around me, I had a strange feeling that I wasn’t going to be getting a very good tip.</p>

<p>They made me their choice because nobody else would do it. Behind my back I could hear them sniggering, all in on the great joke that I was to them. When it finally came to the hard parts, they were glad I was there for them, until I told them I was there for me.</p><p>Beneath a flickering fluorescent light, the ice machine stood obstinately mute, its compressor seemingly having seized sometime during the Johnson administration. I looked out over the dirt parking lot, half expecting the Volare Roadrunner I drove here so many weeks ago to be missing. I found it where it always was: listing to one side from a leaking rear right tire, the deep mud-traction radial grooves more horizontal than any Goodyear engineer had wanted. Even the raccoons didn’t want it, preferring to set up their breeding den under a nearby bush rather than risk the tangy hantavirus-ebola-tetanus cocktail on offer with the hogged-out small-body Mopar.</p><p>I was sitting on the threadbare rattan-weave lawnchair provided by the facilities manager when it happened. In the distance, the fog on the horizon blazed red and blue as flashing lights approached, the motorcade eventually rolling over the four-way-stop intersection caked in burnout marks outside the motel as they pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>In the years after it had happened originally, our nation reached a consensus: we were better off ruled by some random asshole than a man who deigned to become <i>known</i> to us. There was a lottery installed, picked common men. Some of them soared, some of them flamed out. My benefactors were concerned about it, so they decided to take out some insurance.</p><p>Through a combination of mathematical wizardry and an expert system large enough to fully seal the former Brooklyn subway tunnels with hectares of printed-circuit boards they had figured out the variables it used. The conspiracy then set to confounding those variables, forcing the algorithm down a rats-maze of decisions they had already made for it.</p><p>Eventually they figured out that the lottery machine would turn its eye upon me, and brought me in to make a proposal. How could you sneer at someone who offers you unlimited power, even if they did think you to be an uneducated rube, so grateful for the chance at the big time they offered that you could be told what to do? Never did they believe I would have an agenda of my own.</p><p>The next morning, when I awoke in the <i>Presidential</i> Motel, my first and only state-of-the-union conference call served to lay out my entire administration’s program.</p><p>We were going to restart AMC, and we were going to nationalize Detroit Diesel, and we were going to mash those two together until I <i>liked what I saw</i>, God damnit.</p>

<p>If you ask a Canadian what they hate most in life, it is probably going to be something about the weather. This is a rookie mistake, and many sociologists better than yourself have fallen victim to it, their dried bones crushed beneath the treads of New Brunswick’s finest up-armoured Lincoln Navigators. You should not have intervened directly. Instead, if you lie in wait and eavesdrop upon two Canadians discuss their lives, what they actually complain about is <i>shipping costs</i>.</p><p>So it was with me. Whether it was FedEx, UPS or the one-eyed guy who drives a Ford Bronco II haphazardly onto my front lawn, I was fed up with them all. Secret fees, hidden agendas, and foreign curse words were starting to wear upon me heavily. Tragically, I had a yen to buy a Morgan Three-Wheeler, and that yen was pretty much all I had on me.</p><p>Thus, I decided to build my own Three-Wheeler. Harnessing my crew of trained beavers, I directed them to raze a maple tree to the ground, their spinning incisors making short work of the wood. After a series of near-misses at the local hockey rink when trying to use their stick-reshaping machine to form its chassis, I had figured out both a method and a madness that worked well for me. Most importantly, I had collected valuable research-and-development tax credits that would thrill the investors of Switch Motors during our next quarterly meeting at the Timmies down the block.</p><p>At last it was done. Behold, mortals: my great work will echo the words of my deeds into the infinite. As I gripped the ripcord of the ratchet-strapped Bombardier-badged Rotax two-stroke I involuntarily began to throat-sing our national anthem, beaming with pride.</p><p>The local Value Village didn’t know what hit it, even after I demonstrated that it was entirely possible to do a burnout on a half-track Three-Skiier that reached from the Harveys drive through all the way to the womens’ change room in the back hallway.</p><p>So sue me for trying to save a few bucks: it’s not like Magna builds brake parts here anymore.</p>

<p>There’s two times in a man’s life that it is okay to cry: first is the birth of your children, and second is when you get a perfect crimp the first time on a wiring harness you’re trying to repair.</p><p>Sure, I hear the wolves at my door: “Use solder,” they cry, ignorant of vibration resistance. No, doggies, I am taking this all the way to the top. And by all the way to the top I mean I’m going to try and sell this rat-infested limo to Presidential Motor Cars, the used car dealership at the end of my street. They expect the best, and I need to offer them the best. It has to <i>last </i>- at least until their head salesguy has had a chance to whomp on it (”Certified 200 Point Pre-Purchase Inspection”) because their long-suffering mechanic has coincidentally come down with a case of Ex-Lax Borscht.</p><p>Back to the crimp: it’s perfect. I am in tears, like I said.</p><p>On the next crimp, the handle bends and the crimp slides off one end of the wire. I throw the cheap combination stripper/crimper into the garage door, leaving a small dent.</p><p>Maybe there is a third time it is acceptable to cry: when you have to cut off a perfect crimp because you forgot to put heat shrink on first.</p>

<p>There’s something different in the air about Canada. Call it the zing of fresh winter, the tang of low economic productivity or the smell of pre-baked Tim Hortons donuts being defrosted on the drying rack. When I think about my country, I first of all think of its loose standards for car importation.</p><p>The thing is, though, most Canadians don’t want to spend months on the phone with foreign countries, having to learn a million different ways to make the same ribald sex jokes with dockworkers. They want a guy who can get it done, and pocket only between three and four hundred percent of the cost.</p><p>I was thinking about car importation long before my friend came up with the idea. It was as simple as it was beautiful: we would import spindly, long-legged, exotic-shrieking TVRs from a rapidly depressing Blighty and sell them here.</p><p>What I didn’t realize was that, in the end, selling parts to the survivors would soon become our mainline business.</p><p>My operatives would listen to the police radio, visit hospitals, and make their sales pitch on the bedside. Sorry about your little incident, glad you survived, but isn’t it a shame that it’s so hard to find Sagaris bumper skins in this country?</p><p>After a few years of this, my buddy and I were soon brunching with the Prime Minister and lunching with the Finance Minister. It came at a cost, though. Being exposed to this much concentrated TVR goodness burned out the parts of our brains responsible for oversteering wildly into a tree in a car painted like an exploding gay disco, and we ended up importing Honda Beagles and enjoying them quite a bit.</p><p>After all, we’re a practical people, us Canadians.</p>

<p>It’s true what those old philosophers said: if you don’t have a Dodge Rampage shooting invisible meth flames from its bed-mounted lake pipes, you will never know the true meaning of life. Trite though it may seem, I work to live by that old hokey saw every day.</p><p>When I visited Italy, I knew that they wouldn’t necessarily have a Dodge Rampage ready for me, for I had no doubt in my mind they had all been snapped up by their wily billionaire class in such an industrious country. That said, I did know they had hardware stores and a stack of unsold Fiat 500Xs a mile high, and that was pretty much the same thing.</p><p>On my sixth consecutive loop of the rubber-gargling burnout beneath my Italian stallion, Marchionne finally decided I was worth the time of one of his least trusted lieutenants. I dispatched him and his pitiful 458 Italia-powered Dart all too quickly, leaving them both a shattered pile of grit and bone, and unleashed further invective from the hood-mounted PA system.</p><p>“From this day forward product development will cater to my illogical and largely ridiculous demands, Sergio,” I barked. “Prepare yourself for a new age of mandatory truck-bed options on all FCA vehicles.”<br/></p><p>From within the bowels of the unassuming office complex, I could hear an unmistakeable tearing sound. I had pushed him too far. He had invested in <i>rotaries</i>.</p>

<p>The worst part about the impending winter is not the snow, or the road salt, or the early nights and wailing pedestrians getting flattened in the grocery store parking lot by uncontrollably sliding SUVs on bald tires in the dead of January. No, not at all: what is worst in winter is having to give up <i>mopeds</i>.</p><p>Sure, I had tried the usual things in order to keep riding. Studded tires. Front-mounted expansion chambers that shot flame onto the ice in front of me. Ex-Soviet torture implements, their studded solid-plastic Power Wheels wheels filled with ethylene glycol. But it just wasn’t good enough. I was getting old, and part of getting old is admitting that you like to be warm once in awhile.</p><p>Another part of getting old is realizing when other people are undervaluing something so you can ruin their lives by exploiting their weakness. Before I could even complete one entire powerslide around the local de facto work camp cul-de-sac, I had filled the bed of my 1974 Chevy LUV with $250 mopeds and, yes, even scooters. They didn’t even see it coming; I had swooped into their lives, dispensed crisp twenties and disappeared in a cloud of tangy high-ethanol ghetto-top-fuel mix, aspirated into mist by obscene boost levels.</p><p>The next step, as it almost always is, was to find someone with more skill at welding than I had. Shaky Tim wouldn’t be my first choice, mostly due to his eponymous problem, but he got the job done just this side of well enough. As I pulled away from the dockside warehouse in which he plied his trade in exchange for used spray paint cans, I smiled and for the first time since childhood anticipated the snow.</p><p>Someone up there must have been smiling on me at last, because the next morning had a thick white blanket of the cold stuff obscuring my city. A perfect backdrop for my debutante ball, I bellowed Ward Cleaverly at the next-door neighbour kid in mid-shovel as I leapt across the driveway to take command of my new project.</p><p>I want you to imagine the following: you are a regular commuter. Your vehicle has leather seats. You can remember purchasing it new. I do not particularly care about ruining your day with a quad-engined two-stroke abomination of welded-together commuter mopeds barking the shrieking mating call of high-octane chainsaws into your ears as we wait for the city police to clear a wreck between a 2006 Kia Sportage and a 2002 Ford Explorer Sport from the road.</p><p>Atop my heated-seat throne of expansion chambers, I am a king.</p>

<p>A lot of people ask me what it’s like up here in Canada. They want to know one thing above all: what are the salads at Wendy’s like? Does the fabled Wendy’s SuperBar of American Wendy’s legend survive to the modern era in Canada, away from the prying eyes of the feared Corporate?<br/></p><p>In actuality, I advise them while peering over the glimmering hard-light display hovering their citizenship application above my desk, Wendy’s salads in Canada are largely preassembled. There are not really very many options, I tell them while motioning for my android secretary to prepare the fainting couch.</p><p>At last, I reach over and stub out my electronic cigar on the edge of my synthetic-cherrywood desk. Then I rise, looking them directly into the eyes for the last bit.</p><p>In Canada, a Wendy’s salad is an enormous quintuple-digit-calories mass of processed meat, cheese and leaves with names like “Taco Colossus,” and “The Chicken at the End of All Things.”</p><p>By then they usually cancel the application, and I can relax into my seat, accepting a microcheque from the Canadian government for their appreciation of my efforts in keeping the secret of the majestic Northern SuperBar away from the uncommitted eyes of American wannabe-refugees.</p>

<p>Doesn’t everyone deserve a little time off for R&amp;R? No, they don’t. Some of us are so irredeemably broken that only one more shot at the ol’ Sisyphean boulder, on our <i>own terms</i> - none of this handicapping from hand-wringing, well-to-do Firestone managers - will do. We don’t want to stop. We want to <i>finish</i>. And over the years, I had met a lot of “some of us,” all with the same problem.</p><p>It starts as a spark. You feel skilled. Anything that you see can be fixed. But then people tell you, wait, don’t fix this. Fix this other thing, and do it faster. What is broken, what is wrong, stares into your face, denying by proxy your very identity. Before you realize it, the resentment piles up inside you like it’s slowly filling your body with this unbearable pressure.</p><p>I had seen too much of it in my career. That’s why I organized a public service. I call it <i>Helicoils Across America</i>.</p><p>For just a dollar a day, you can fund this exclusive retreat full of fine 1950s through 1970s import automobiles, into which we turn a select group of burned out flat-rate mechanics loose. Inside this harem of rust, they will find themselves, and as they fix drooping driveshafts, hike up dented Sapporos onto Korean mud terrains and stare into the moon, unblinking, contemplating the true nature of torque specs and fastener stretch, they will repair themselves.</p><p>Won’t you please give today? Do it, or we’ll set them free in your city, and I can guarantee you you don’t want to be sharing the road with a dozen mechanic-owned shitboxes.</p>

<p>My uncle worked for Mitsubishi. I don’t like to talk about it much.</p><p>One night we were at my cousins’ place for Hanukkah. He had been working late, was tired when he entered the apartment. I don’t remember if he said anything or not, but I do remember the long, sad look he gave the assembled family before he slipped into the back room.</p><p>The back room was this mysterious study that we were never allowed to play in as kids. Once, when my cousins were pre-occupied, I snuck down the hall to peek through the somehow-unlocked door. I pushed it open, just a crack, and gazed within.</p><p>When he disappeared that night, on Hanukkah Eve, I remember his wife - my aunt - she told me that she felt <i>relieved</i>. I asked her why, but by then the lash of propriety and petit-bourgeoisie social harmony had broken itself upon her back, and she refused to speak any further on the matter.</p><p>It wasn’t until years later, in my misspent high school years, that I realized what I had seen on that wall, long before my favourite uncle had disappeared. My buddy Griff and his hemp-soaked Plymouth Voyager would help me find it, as part of his quest to haul the oil-starved wreck of an engine free from the car. I would never have looked all that closely, had it not been for the happenstance that its valve cover cracked upon swinging into the side of the engine crane.</p><p>Through the crack, my heart raced as some part of my brain immediately recognized the pattern. After I laid eyes on just one bank of its porcupine bristle of 24 single-cam-operated valves poised atop the ribbed block for the first time I knew that it could be no other engine but the one I had borne witness to. I knew immediately that my plan to saving the family name and restoring us to our former glory would orbit about the Mitsubishi 6G72, like an overdriven sun preparing to go supernova.</p><p>Long story short, it turned out that my extended family did not particularly feel that a four hundred wheel horsepower twin-turbocharged AWD 1991 Grand Caravan was an appropriate memorial to my uncle, even if I hadn’t blown the humble A543 5-speed into a pile of greasy confetti outside Long John Silvers.</p>

<p>Back in the day, there wasn’t a lot of stuff to do. That’s why people formed clubs. You could get together with others who shared the same interests as you and pool resources, teach each other intricacies of your trade, maybe even find someone you could spend the rest of your life with. In the modern era, though, clubs had been rendered obsolete by the freedom of identity and freedom of association lent to us by the Internet as it descended upon us all like a rabid wolverine on PCP.</p><p>When my boss came to me and told me that we were going to do a piece on a modern-day spotters club, I rolled my eyes. What were those greybeards going to teach me?</p><p>The next morning, before the dawn, I met with my fellow watchers. Dressed in tweed and denim, they all had tips on how to best capture our quarry should we spot it. It would turn out that I had picked a particularly auspicious day to make my first, as one of the older gentlemen began to speak in an excited delirium, much like an angry tourist being tazed at an airport.</p><p>I grasped my reporter’s notebook tightly in one hand as I pulled aside the bushes to get a spot at what had been so rare as to excite him. I followed his gaze until I came across a small black sedan sitting in the middle of the grocery-store parking lot.</p><p>“A Suzuki Kizashi,” he gasped, unwilling to take his eyes off of it for one split second, lest the spell become broken.<br/></p><p>“Magnificent,” agreed a second.<br/></p><p>“Look at that waxing job. An enthusiast,” chimed in a third.</p><p>When I returned to the newspaper with my photographs and front-page article, my boss was infuriated. There was no such car as the Suzuki Kizashi, he screamed at me while throwing the folder of my proofs in my face. You might as well have taken a picture of Bigfoot.</p>

<p>You know, I saw a nice J10 just the other day, coming back from lunch. It wasn’t a Honcho, but it was almost as nice. Had a big ol’ pushbar on the front. My coworkers noticed it too, commented on how it was so weird to see a truck that old in daily use.</p><p>Of course, by then I had already ratcheted back the titanium-grip hydraulic handbrake that jutted like a prison bar from afore the Mexican-blanketed bench seat. Before I had even struck the bump stops, they were screaming, before the fleshy sound of their animalistic panic distorted like an old television beneath the wall of noise from the twin EWG dump pipes jutting open and flaring hot infrared death from the hood stacks.</p><p>My old Crown Victoria was no slouch in the pursuit department from the factory, much less so when bolstered with the many-thousand-horsepower alky-burning big block only halfway mounted into its diminutive frame. Even so, I somehow lost track of the Jeep. Assuming it was somewhere in the nearby residential neighbourhood, I left-foot-braked my way over the lawn of a daycare, snaking the flaming four-inch side-exit exhaust into the bike lane as I did.</p><p>A sorcerer’s trick: when I followed the J10 driver, he had somehow transformed into an International Harvester Travelall. You must believe me that normally, I cannot be tempted from my quarry by the spotting of a tempting mirage. Even so, the owner of the home came out to find me on his lawn, throwing twenties at his front door.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it is typical to dream after being knocked unconscious by a T18 layshaft, but I dreamt. I could see my mother sitting at the dining room table, weeping over a stack of mimeographed “MISSING” posters, each of them emblazoned with my older brother Carmelo’s smiling face, one of our family’s few good pictures of him from those earlier days, sitting atop his Power Wheels CJ7. How could he have left us like that?</p><p>When I awoke in his Unabomber shed, it had been stripped clean. I assumed at first that I had been out for several hours, but based on the relative depth of the mud splattered on the side of the corrugated-tin siding by a rapidly fleeing set of Super Swampers, I knew that the depth of my slumber had been shallow. That meant he wasn’t far. But how would I catch up to my brother?</p><p>I believe Carmelo wanted me to catch him. He no doubt recognized me and left enough parts to build a Gladiator behind, not out of the urgency of his flight, but out of a long-dormant desire to re-unite. My hands flew as I set to work immediately, using stray AMC and Jeep parts as improvised cudgels and pry-bars, as the manufacturer intended.</p><p>When it was done, it was not as if the Gladdy ran, but it walked well enough to follow the trail of leaks to catch the slowly fleeing Carmelo, now poised atop a smoke-blasting throne of Forward Control excess travelling at the approximate speed of a particularly out-of-shape box turtle. I clucked with dismay as I quickly overran the oil-chewing Hurricane with what turned out to be the only historically recorded instance of an AMC 287 with 2.72 gears beating another motor vehicle in a drag race.</p><p>I pulled Carmelo from the cab and sat him against the Swampers (now revealed to my keen eye to have been a clever retread on grotesquely balded Nitto Mud Terrains, how shameful). It would require quite a bit of persuasion to win him over to my side, to return him to the modern world.</p><p>“Have you ever seen the insides of a Subaru? They do some <i>fucked up shit</i>,” I offered.<br/></p><p>His eyes went wide. He was once again my brother.</p>

<p>They say there’s no better teacher than experience. When I first came onboard at the self-driving car company, I thought they wanted my experience. I would soon find out how wrong I was.</p><p>My job was simple. They would give me an eight-hundred-horsepower Ford Fairlane with a hydraulic piton gun big enough to re-anus a sperm whale, and they let me loose on the streets. For my part, I would find the most erratic drivers Canada had to offer, kidnap them, and return them to The Training Yards for use in training the predictive accident-avoidance neural networks at the core of our fine automobiles.</p><p>A lot of the newspapers said what I did was barbaric, that I was breaking up families by shooting a harpoon through the side doors of a GMC Envoy from four hundred yards and rapturing their confused teenagers into the night. I said that it was a kind of honour to be the best at something, even if what you were best at was being the worst.</p><p>I had a stratospheric rise. As it turns out, despite what everyone says, my commute had in fact the worst drivers in the world. On the way to work, I would pick up one or two bounties and what they taught the robots would boost me up the social and career ladder.</p><p>It was hard to feel ungrateful when you got to see the horrified look on the face of the guy who was just weaving between lanes and using the shoulder to pass as you threw him into an electrified cage, but I always felt like the whole thing simply took too much effort.</p><p>Soon after, I would bring the bad drivers to me. It was so simple I hated myself for not finding it sooner: we would set up a reality television program looking for Canada’s Worst Drivers. Those same families who hated my use of hydraulic ranged weaponry to lasso their angry loved ones were soon narcing them out, filling the phone lines, social media accounts and my postal mailbox with photos and videos of those around them who needed to be taught a lesson.</p><p>There’s two parts of teaching someone a lesson, though: both sides learn.</p>

<p>I was invited to a classy dinner party the other day, so in order to improve my chances of being a dazzling conversationalist, I decided to bone up on my New Yorkers. My <i>Chrysler</i> New Yorkers, that is.</p><p>Believe you me, I reviewed them all. The turbos, the boats, but I finally decided on the humble yet noble 1980 “Fifth Avenue” edition. It is both insightful and poignant for our recent era, and I felt discussing the intersection of can-do optimism and today’s reduced expectations for American excess in view of the Nipponese threat from abroad would be a worthwhile dinner conversation to lead.</p><p>After I finished chewing an inch-deep rut in the host’s front lawn, no easy feat in the middle of winter with only a single-barrelled 318 for help, I strode inside. All of the other guests stared at me in varying levels of disbelief, like a rheostat for tolerance of my brand of antisocial behaviour.</p><p>&ldquo;Here I am,” I said, clutching a gift bottle of Seafoam caked in the arterial spray of a AMC 4.0 (1987 “Pioneer” vintage, a fine year) in one hand as I stepped over the threshold. The strange thing about dinner parties is it’s like you don’t recognize your friends at them. In fact, none of these people looked familiar to me at all, even the host who is now calling the police.<br/></p><p>I stepped back onto the front lawn, now covered in steaming puddles of hot coolant, ejaculated at some point during the donuts from the cracked plastic endtanks of the shamefully undersized old-old stock radiator. As you do, I checked the address. It matched, but this was obviously not the place. It was then that I heard yelling.</p><p>My host, and my friends, were huddled in front of the house, warming a pigeon they had caught over the slant-six of a 1968 Dodge A108 Tradesman van. Like I said: <i>classy</i>.</p>

<p>A lot of people howl at me for my support of the current Alberta government, because they just do not understand how things are so awful right now and not getting better right away. Perhaps I support them because I recognize this exact arc in my own life.</p><p>You see, Alberta is a lot like a skinny-fat 80s domestic luxobarge. Think of it as a Lincoln Continental Mark VII. It’s got a lot of wheelbase, it’s a little hard to turn, and it likes to keep going when you tell it to go in a certain direction. When you hit something, you don’t find out for a few weeks because the hood is so far out in front of you.</p><p>Like all mid-80s domestic luxobarges, it has been owned by an enormous chain of Previous Owners who have ruined it in many ways. Notley is like me, having inherited this total shitpile and needing to fix it up.</p><p>If you think of modern Alberta history and totally ignore the socreds in general (which pretty much everyone does), you can think of Lougheed as the last guy who really gave a shit about its condition. He bought it used, sure, but he washed and waxed it, made sure the landau top was gleaming in the sun. With the exclusion of a few dings and dents caused by misjudging the distance between his car and the garage wall, it was generally treated pretty well.</p><p>Klein, oh boy, everyone knows about Klein. He got a death grip on the wheel and didn’t let go. Did he fix the ball joints he blew out while jumping curbs to drive through elementary school playgrounds? Did he fuck. A little bit of Tuck tape on the tail lights will take the heat off until the next payday cheque clears, he told his aides while demonstrating that you can also clean chrome with toothpaste and clean your teeth with bourbon.</p><p>Stelmach taught himself how to parallel park it and then got white-boy wasted and left it behind Cowboys until it got towed. When he went to pick it up from the police auction lot, he wore a fake mustache and blamed a malevolent space entity for his actions.</p><p>Redford wanted to make it real pretty, the best in all the country, but she only got as far as buying a ton of rice parts to fill the trunk with. It’s hard to justify going to the alignment shop when the price of tires is so cheap, too.</p><p>Hancock backed it into a dumpster while doing a hate donut behind the ‘leg.</p><p>Diamond Jim - he drove it at full throttle on the highway, his tie tied around his forehead like the 

hachimaki of a teenage kamikaze, shaking his arms repeatedly as he cannonballed to work out the death wobble. If and when he hit trouble, he loudly told everyone else on the highway it was their fault for getting in his way before speeding off again.</p><p>Finally, the steaming, hogged-out wreckage of the once-proud Panther was dumped in the lap of someone who was maybe a little new to wrenching. Not to worry, she says, maybe I’ll start by replacing some of the transmission fluid it’s missing.</p><p>As the neighbours walk by and scream and jeer at the non-running rust heap parked on her lawn, it’s hard not to visualize myself in such a situation. It’s not like Princess Auto has no-questions-asked refunds on school boards.</p>

<p>Gather round and hear the tale of horror which lives at the heart of all men: the tale of the <i>Previous Owner</i>. Yes, he (or she) who must not be named lives within your vehicle forevermore, their half-assed repairs, curb hits and confused modifications a stratigraphic layer over the complex yet sweet melange of failure that is buying a used car.</p><p>My tale is that which you imagine most unlikely: I had become the Previous Owner, but I did not set out to become them. Indeed, my heart was in the best place, that of fixing and flipping a land barge. Two blocks long and half a mile wide, the 1974 Cadillac Eldorado was the kind of ride you would give to only disgraced third-world autocrats and the generally mentally infirm.</p><p>It was simple work, or so I thought. But then by chance I slid my garage creeper a little far one morning and caved in the rocker panels with the back of my head. Rust flakes fell like snow on a December morning in Hell. Tapping the other parts of the body half-angrily with a pick revealed to me that, indeed, the rest of the shell had the integrity of soggy cauliflower.</p><p>Surely one small bodging, just to keep it on the road, would be enough? I was so foolish. I thought I was a god, grabbing for the steel-reinforced Bondo and chicken wire reinforcement mesh as I did. When it was done, it was mint. I could no longer look directly at it without an abiding sense of deep shame integral to my self-image as a mechanic, but in my mind’s eye I knew that it would look good to a rando, just as it had looked good to me.</p><p>One bodge led to another, and before long that Cadillac was back on the road, saved. I had done the wrong thing, but hadn’t it ended the right way?</p><p>I was at the Pick N Pull the following weekend. There, impaled on a forklift, laid my bodged Cadillac, stripped of its motor and running gear and thrown away like my hack-job work merited no appreciation whatsoever. As bad as I imagined myself to be, I could not compare to a man who would throw away an innocent car.</p><p>Deep in the shadow of the crusher, I gazed in horror at the ways of the Next Owner.</p>

<p>From what depths did the Suzuki Carry emerge? O, that van of the beer-can-sized-cylinders and the teeny tiny tires, but rich in the ways of cargo.</p><p>I am the only man still living who can tell you the story of the Suzuki Carry. I can do this because I was there.</p><p>It all started with the government. They told me that they needed a postal van for the apocalypse, and that they needed it yesterday. I smiled, and I could tell they were unnerved by the sight of my teeth.</p><p>I reached into my desk, the drawer marked “VANS” in unstable Sharpie block printing like that of a child, and withdrew for them a picture of my magnum opus. One and a half lanes wide and four car lengths long, it featured armour capable of resisting sustained barrages of depleted-uranium rounds from an A-10 Warthog’s GAU-8A for up to eight minutes at ranges not less than 1500 feet.</p><p>They looked at my diagram and asked if I had anything smaller.</p><p>Weeks later, when we presented them with the first prototype, I can remember my boss beaming with pride. It ate me up inside that he seemed to take so much enjoyment in my humiliation, though I now realize that there was no way he could have seen the hatred lurking behind my placid, numb, professional exterior and expensive Bubble Era pinstriped suit.</p><p>I returned to the drawing board, this time illustrating a prototype of what eventually became the Suzuki X-90. If they wanted a compromise, I thought, they would have to work for it.</p>

<p>Once, I was an engineer at Chevrolet. I designed them all. Cathedral ports. Short-runner intake manifolds. Cams with a base circle so thick, you could throw a fully grown Papillon through the empty journals and it would emerge untouched.</p><p>That’s when the Problems started. GM was going into bankruptcy. They just didn’t have room for a guy like me, they said, they were going to have to find someone who understood the new world a little better. Oh, I understood that plenty well, and after falling on hard times for awhile I had begun to pick myself back up. I was a private detective, the best you could find, as long as your crime somehow involved volumetric efficiency. I got a real thing for volumetric efficiency.</p><p>Luckily enough, I picked the perfect town to hang out my shingle in. Before the first week was through, I was summoned to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to investigate a murder. The cops were flummoxed: how could a respected scientist be killed inside a sealed wind tunnel without leaving a single piece of evidence? They turned to me to answer.</p><p>Without a further word, I unfurled a 3D plot of the wind tunnel’s flow rates based on a rough estimate of compressor size and plenum depth. It was drawn in crude charcoal and coloured with a yellow Crayola I had stolen from the pizza restaurant below where I rented my office.</p><p>“Holy shit!” yelped the head cop. “Did you draw that in the car on your way here?”<br/></p><p>I just smiled, my thin lips wrapping around an unlit matchstick, and then I knelt down. Under the body, I showed them, was the secret. An unopened bottle of prescription heart pills rolled out from beneath. It was certainly true that a pump had failed, but it wasn’t the one they were looking at.</p>

<p>Sealed for life. Those magical three words are how such legendary manufacturers as Chrysler and Mercedes shot to the top of the reliability lists and stayed there for all eternity, unchallenged. How could one say something is maintenance-intensive if indeed it is maintenance-<i>free</i>, shrieked philosophers of quality control as they threw themselves off cliffs and into the paths of fully-loaded passenger carriages in their fury?</p><p>Somehow, in some small way, those titans of mechanical engineering had fallen, failing to account for the exact angle of the chamfer on the intern’s retaining snap ring, the valve body’s exact behaviour when pulling a log cabin up a hill from a cold start in December, or simply that they were actually totally retarded and holy shit a new one costs how much from the dealer?</p><p>Enter me. They called me the Unsealer.</p><p>With my powerful tools and insatiable appetite for dismantling, I would tear down anything they claimed was “sealed for life” and put new fluid in it or something. Grateful citizens would fall at my feet, praising me for my creativity and willingness to brazenly disregard manufacturer documentation, even the little cartoons they show you of someone having fun with an X through their head.<br/></p><p>I was halfway through forcing my way into an Expensive Factory-Brand RTV gasket using a pair of nail clippers and weapons-grade profanity when the first Getrag kill squad rolled up.</p>

<p>Did you know that when they develop allergy pills, they lock innocent people in a “pollen chamber” and pump them full of the thing that they are allergic to <i>to see if they are still allergic to it</i>? It’s true, and it gave me some ideas.</p><p>I figured if they can make a pill that makes people less allergic to something as ubiquitous and natural as pollen, it must be much easier for me to make a pill to feel better about the annoyances in my own life. To that extent, I immediately sent away for a correspondence course in pharmacological discovery and development.</p><p>Almost a full weekend of study ensued. You’d think this kind of thing is very difficult, but it turns out that it wasn’t! Soon I figured out that they would just accept whatever I wrote down as long as the cheque cleared. That’s right, I was just effortlessly brilliant. A natural, they said in the letter that included the tiny origami mortarboard that I couldn’t figure out how to unfold, please send alumni donations to make your school better.</p><p>Don’t worry, University of River Phoenix, I got you. Just as long as I complete my magnum opus, my pill to prevent humanity from being dogged by this horrid allergen everywhere in the environment. But first I had to construct my special allergen chamber.</p><p>It wasn’t too hard to find decommissioned CDC “clean rooms.” All you had to do was promise that you would burn them in some kind of “otto clove,” whatever that is. They even <i>paid</i> me to take them away! These things were perfectly good, I thought as I hosed off the strange red jelly that coated their interior at the coin car wash. Soon, I had constructed my chamber, and developing the first prototype pill took only another few hours of mostly doodling and learning how not to mash my fingers in the pill press.</p><p>I put out an ad in the paper. A large portion of my degree reading material focused on why you should not test pills on yourself, and I felt like it was probably correct. You would be surprised how many people show up when you offer free pills of unknown quality, no questions asked, as long as you sit in a dark room.</p><p>My first guinea pig arrived. I was beyond excited, vibrating as I pulled the lever that would introduce the hated allergen into the chamber.</p><p>I looked on with awe. I had gotten it right the first time - the subject did not seem to be responding to the styling of the Buick Rendezvous at all. Another accomplishment for pharmacological science.</p>

Aren’t those worth more?</p><p>It was surprisingly easier to do than I thought. Rather than negotiate in person, I farmed the deal-making portion out to a team of outsourcers working on commission, who harassed the sellers until they accepted a price so low it bordered on criminal. I found my humble suburban street filling with raunchy minivan after raunchy minivan, with their oh so ambitious names - like Summit, Venture, Odyssey - seeming to taunt the go-nowhere, do-nothing lives of their previous owners.</p><p>On these corroded, Cheerio-filled yet blank media, I would construct my most drastic work of automotive performance art.</p><p>At last, it was done. Through proxies and professional actors hired to be me, the forced-induction family haulers filtered their way back into ordinary society. Soon, I would no longer be late for work, held up by a funeral procession of vans without the meat to merge.</p><p>That morning, I found myself behind one of my projects, and spread across my face an increasingly frustrated grin the entire time it did ten under, the driver oblivious of its immense horsepower and oversized brakes.</p><p>Perhaps just tying a brick to the gas pedal would have been easier on the ol’ bank account.</p>

<p>Television will tell you that the Dodge Diplomat, despite its name, will not give you diplomatic immunity. In this case, as well as most others, television is absolutely correct. I just wish it hadn’t taken ramming a judge’s Jag XJR across the courthouse lawn to figure it out.</p><p>As they read me Article 104 of the the United Nations Charter as it pertains to diplomatic immunity, I came to realize that the borders of my garage were not considered by the United Nations to be a nation. I made appeals: pointing out that the hydrocarbon reserves trapped in my driveway were greater than those of Denmark, provided bank receipts to prove that my frequent part-out threads represented a healthy balance of trade, established a central bank to get a preferential, professional-to-professional, rate from my credit card issuer. I even pointed repeatedly at the badge on the back of the big-body Dodge, but all to no avail.</p><p>I was getting frustrated and the handcuffs were growing closer and closer. What could I do to prove to them that I deserved nationhood? All at once, it hit me.</p><p>“I stole that Diplomat from Blues Brothers cosplayers.”</p><p>Works every time.</p>

<p>I am momentarily taken aback when one of the waiting PTA moms sticks her head inside my open drivers’ window. Hands moving, I start to explain in a panic to her that I’m not dropping my kid off here but instead just getting through the playground zone, please don’t call the police, I’m not a creeper.</p><p>Of course she’s not looking at <i>me</i>. What she has seen is the baby seat in the rear, and her instinct to compare her brood to mine has surpassed the normal fear-response that the clapped-out Polara would otherwise engender in those of her social strata.</p><p>“What a <i>gorgeous</i> retro baby seat,” she coos in a half-Valley Girl, half-Mean Girl pitch as she cranes her neck to get a lock on my child.</p><p>“What&hellip; what is this?” She’s figured out my ruse.<br/></p><p>You see, I’m not terribly good at fabrication. Naturally, when it came time to get a bottle mount for my wet nitrous kit, I chose to re-use someone else’s garbage. After looking through my suburban alleyway for a bit, I found it - an expired baby seat. Surely this would distract the cops, I thought, they wouldn’t want to arrest an unfit father.</p><p>What I hadn’t counted on was that my fellow reproductive-age humans would demand to see the baby. They wanted always to know more about it, to swap stories about where children vomit and how much. In order to get that information, they would even let my rusted rattletrap draw closer, within striking radius of their faux-luxury leasemobile mommybarges.</p><p>“Ah, you’ve found our little pride and joy, Tommy Nosbottle,” I say to her with a grin.<br/></p><p>At the same moment she reels backward in revulsion, the child-labour crosswalk guards began to disperse. I hit the pipe hard, stepping out sideways across the lane of travel, rear tires smoking as Li’l Tommy screams his first words.</p><p>“Healthy lungs!” I bark out the window over the sound of distending radials.<br/></p><p>In all my day and a half of being a father, I had never been prouder.</p>

<p>A man’s love for his Camaro is like a gentleman’s love for fine wine. Namely, the part where you kick down the fire door to the Boone’s Farm warehouse and start two-fistedly chugging as much as you can before security catches up with you and issues a skull-rattling tactical suplex out in the parking lot.</p><p>What I’m trying to say is that I sure did love my Camaro. She was a cantankerous but sweet second-gen, and the way she was lost to me is a story as old as time. It begins, as many of your culture’s myths and legends do, with a clown.</p><p>Back then, money was tight. It turns out there was a thing called an “economy” and it must have been broken because it wasn’t producing a whole heck of a lot of cash in old Switch’s pocket. I called the government and offered to get my hands greasy, really get on up inside that economy machine’s guts and see if there was a stripped out PVC gear or something, some kind of stupid swage joint made by an intern mechanical engineer on his second Red Bull of deadline-day morning. They told me it was sort of a metaphor, and when I asked if that was a car made by AMC the line went dead. I was going to have to take matters into my own hands.</p><p>I got a job working as a birthday party clown. When I tell people who were “behind the nose” as it was, they are in awe that I studied under the tutelage of one “Screams” McGee, possibly the most accomplished and storied birthday party clown to ever have lived. If you visit Arlington, you will see his immense tomb looming over the hills, carved out of gleaming polished granite by hands and funds unknown.</p><p>At the time, I knew only two things about McGee: he liked taking complimentary hits of the nitrous tank I had ratchet-strapped through the rust holes in the rear floor pan, and he never, <i>ever</i> wanted to show up late for a party. It was critical that he be there to absorb every minute of the ride. I had never taken a job seriously before this one. There was something about him that expected <i>more</i> from you, and I desired deeply for reasons I still do not understand to gain his acceptance.</p><p>My repertoire was a little “different” from what they would teach you in clown college: kids did not love my big-block Mopar log-manifold balloon animals, nor did they particularly enjoy getting hosed down with starting fluid from my trick lapel flower. But when I started juggling the sawzall collection that took up permanent residence in my trunk, they would all fall silent. Once the money was exchanged and “Screams” had given bedding the mom his best shot, we would disappear onto the horizon in a cloud of flaming fuel and aerosol tetanus.</p><p>What happened to the Camaro, you ask? You beg me to tell you, grabbing at my shirt with bloodied fingers like a condemned prisoner digging his way to freedom in one last act of futility. I will tell you, but know now that it brings me great pain.</p><p>When that fateful last call came down, “Screams” thought that it would be impossible to be on time. He became despondent, and nothing is more depressing than a sad clown. I twigged that perhaps this would be my chance to impress him. We climbed into the Camaro, and the 35-inch mud-terrains out back didn’t find traction until well into third gear.</p><p>I heard a squeaking sound throughout the launch, which I assumed at first to be the chassis settling, or your common everyday interior rattles. How wrong I was: in point of fact, a rubber chicken had become entangled in the pedals. My discovery came only at the point at which we were well into the lobby of the next-door Chuck E. Cheese.</p><p>Any clown will tell you: <i>never go into the Chuck E. Cheese</i>. That’s their turf. I could hear their ratcheting howls, the clicking of their nails across the Swiss cheese body panels of the Camaro. I looked at McGee. He looked at me - just one glance - and then he opened his door and fell into the costumed mob. That got their attention, and they swarmed him like snakes in heat. As I slunk away, I could hear his cackling voice as he lit off his remaining supply of Silly String in paroxysmal fireballs, followed only by a shrill gurgling yelp as one of their unearthly jaws latched upon his throat.</p><p>I’ll never understand why he did that for me. What I do understand is that the second-gen Camaro is a sturdy car if you plan on driving through a Chuck E. Cheese on your way to a child’s birthday party. And that’s why I’m standing here today, introducing myself as the new president and CEO of General Motors.</p>

<p>That first hit of high revs changes a man. I found myself chasing more. I wanted to feel that rush again, that throbbing insistence as the tachometer climb to unreasonable levels. But where could I go up from here? Maybe that explained why the pusher, a man who I thought was my friend, was laughing so hard as I walked away from his rattle-trap FC, a broken shell of a person incapable of ever enjoying the lowly heights of a six-thousand-something redline.</p><p>The obvious first step was to build up a rotary of my own. I traveled to Japan to find an ancient wizard who could uncork the dark magic of the twirling Doritos, lost in their dance of fire and crankcase oil haze. When I could not find such a wizard, I decided to try and construct my own crude balancing mechanism out of an old Roadforce machine and enough peyote to crack the foundation of your average military building. You might have read about that in the papers.</p><p>When that failed, I found myself back on the streets, wandering endlessly in search of my next hit. It turns out the airport is very close to my home, and I heard a glorious sound above me as an enormous, gleaming beast appeared overhead.</p><p>Of course, I thought, <i>airplanes</i>. I had neglected them because of my refusal to travel in any form of public transportation. But yet there was some secret there, wasn’t there?</p><p>Let me tell you one thing about the airport: they don’t seem to think it’s very important to lock the gate next to their junk airplane graveyard. All this strange enormous flying bus had to protect it was a wad of police tape with a label speaking of some kind of accident investigation board. Surely they wouldn’t need <i>all</i> of this plane to figure out what went wrong.</p><p>After unbolting one of the engines from the plane, I noticed that it appeared to be quite heavy. Even the hydraulic engine crane built into the bed of my metric-chassis El Camino could not lift it from the crater it produced in the tarmac below. Of course, I thought as I lifted my water-cooled sawzall, this kind of thing is never an easy swap.</p><p>With a few clearancing cuts for what I assumed to be extraneous features such as heat shields and pleasant exterior trim, I had my prize: a gleaming if pitted CFM56-S. After several trips, I could reassemble what I determined to be a reasonable facsimile of the engine in my driveway.</p><p>I’ll tell you one thing about when you fire up a jet-engine-powered T-Bucket in your driveway: you get to meet the neighbours. Unfortunately, my day job at the time was assistant mortuary director, and I got to meet them at work.</p>

<p>You might think that raising the intelligence of dogs to human levels such that they can operate motor vehicles will free humanity from the shackles of pet-ownership-as-slavery and usher in a new golden age of social achievement, and you’d be right. That’s not to say there weren’t problems, though.</p><p>First, the big one: dogs are colourblind. I don’t mean like your asshole drunk uncle Cliff is colourblind, I mean they can’t see anything that we recognize as colours. So traffic lights were right out. You would not believe how many accidents we had before we figured that one out, and just <i>try</i> to convict a happy, loving golden retriever of careless driving in the burning death of a family of five.</p><p>Think that’s bad? Gets worse: dogs - and I by no means intend to be stereotypical here, I’m just talking about <i>some</i> dogs, please don’t sic your poodle lawyers on me - love to tailgate cars for some reason. They just want to chase that rear bumper! I flagged down a taxi the other day and it took me six hours to get to the airport because the Schnauzer driving was too captivated by the ring road to get off.</p><p>Nowadays, there is no way to criticize a dog. The new generation of puppies has grown up only hearing “<i>you’re</i> a good boy.” In my day, it was at least left to a question.</p>

<p>Truth be told, the free promotional t-shirts were pretty cool, but it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind when they pitched me a job working on the factory-backed AMC race team. When I was told later that the factory stopped making cars in the late 80s, everything made a lot more sense. Before that, though, we were in it to win a season of NASCAR.</p><p>No matter how many long hours had been spent threatening the owners of fabrication shops, it always brought me great joy to look at the carbon-fibre imitation woodgrain on the side of our Eagle race car. Dick Teague’s designs still looked great, although we did need to build a little bit of widebody, underbody, overbody, frontbody, rearbody and wheel aero in order to be competitive with the new cars that the other teams were running. They were based upon very aerodynamic, lithe models like the Camry and Malibu, you see.</p><p>It was a major coup to get the mucky-mucks in race control to allow us to run an all-wheel-drive setup. You said <i>stock</i> cars, my team steward said while holding a nine-inch buck-knife to the throat of the impound inspector. I remember it like it was yesterday, and because of his hard work we were able to reliably get almost second-last in every event. Once, we got third last because of a pretty bad crash on the start/finish straight.</p><p>What killed our team in the end was trying to adapt the AMC 360 to NASCAR duty. With fuel injection and the chance that opening their hearts to a new engine family may also open the door to the threat of terrifying foreign <i>overhead camshafts</i>, it was simply too advanced for them. But wasn’t innovation what AMC was all about?</p><p>Later, I realized it was actually bankruptcy that AMC was all about. Maybe we were a closer tribute than we thought.<br/></p><p>I still look back on those days and smile. It’s not easy to think about, especially when driving my daily driver, a twin-turbocharged 401-powered SX/4 built from our team spares, demands so much of my attention.</p>

<p>For weeks now, I had looked out of the window of my humble brownstone apartment to see that my neighbourhood was becoming gentrified. The signs were all around me: taco stands were replaced by kombucha vats, pedestrians used full, fluent English in their profane slurs towards drivers and worst of all, there were <i>hipsters</i> on the front steps of my building.</p><p>I spoke to the super, which is of course what you do. His phone never picked up. It turns out he had been captured by the new community association - what the hell was a community association? - and sent to what they called an “aspirational” neighbourhood to be reunited with his own people. It looked like I was on my own with this one.</p><p>Somehow, it got <i>worse</i>: when I opened the hood to my Ford Aspire in order to top up the oil and refill the washer fluid, the hipsters became outraged. In fact, one of them ran to the corner to alert the community association, and was only stopped from doing so by spotting a scene of poverty out of the corner of his eye. He returned to the scene, eyes downcast, the liberal guilt present on his face.</p><p>It seemed that you could only work on things yourself in this neighbourhood if you were eccentric, ridiculous, some kind of <i>artist</i>, and ideally funded with your parents’ money. I sat in my apartment, the blinds drawn, knowing that my Aspire needed a new thermostat and that these punks were keeping me from doing so. What made it worse was that these punks were also somehow the establishment. It took a late-night TV show about filming yourself riding the subway for me to figure out what I needed to do.</p><p>“My aesthetic is deliberately swerving into shopping carts in the parking lot of the Kroger,” I said to the packed art gallery, before unveiling the Aspire, dripping oil onto the cedar-plank flooring. There was raucous applause, which only grew in intensity as I pulled the top rad hose before the astounded crowd, the gusher of rusty coolant signifying man’s struggle with global warming.</p><p>The hipsters stood in the back and applauded gently, and I swear I could hear them arguing with one another over who had “discovered” my outsider-art talents first.<br/></p>

<p>Sure, the SCCA took umbrage that I had managed to read the <i>entire</i> rulebook, even the top secret sections that were surrounded by legal boilerplate to prevent even the hardiest of grognard rule-lawyers from wandering into it and looting the place. What I didn’t tell them is that I <i>outsourced</i> the whole deal, fed it into a neural network running on a bank of computers the size of Nebraska until they came back with one simple solution to my problem.</p><p>Buried deep within the SCCA Solo rulebook laid a provision. If I could defeat the regional director in single combat, I would get my one wish. They didn’t even see me coming, the keening wail of the twin turbochargers jutting from the hood of my carbon-fibre Volvo 480 notwithstanding.</p><p>The regional director went down without much of a fight, my practice in the garage repeatedly dropping wrenches on my feet having rendered me largely impervious to pain. His unconscious body sagged to the floor, defeated.</p><p>Behind me, seated at a card table, the shadowy National Directors of the SCCA wanted to know my one wish.</p><p>“Take the 1988 Lincoln Town Car off the NOC list,” I said without hesitation, “F-Street seems pretty unfair for a luxobarge prank.”<br/></p>

<p>“HONK IF YOU’RE FURY,” the bumper sticker in front of me says. Being currently behind the wheel of a &lsquo;66 station wagon, I comply. It is only once I tilt my head out of the driver-side window to greet the driver in front of me that I realize I should not have purchased a cheapo aftermarket windshield, what with all this distortion in the glass. My specific complaint at this point is that it makes it very difficult to tell one R from two.</p><p>I can deal with this like an adult, I tell myself, as I attempt to get out of the conversation with the man-dressed-like-a-cat as smoothly as possible.</p><p>“Fuck you!” I scream. “Learn to signal!”</p><p>Nailed it.</p><p>He climbs back into his car, yelling something indecipherable.

<p>When it comes to parking downtown, I often find it difficult to maneuver even a moderately sized car into today’s penny-pinchingly-tight parallel (and often, sadly, orthogonal) parking spaces. This means I don’t get to gain the full cornucopia of pleasures that may be available downtown. I was told that some of them might indeed be used car parts.<br/></p><p>The dilemma ate at me: risk my quarter panels by street parking, or give up on sweet used performance parts sold by bougie glass-walled condo dwellers who neither had the aptitude to install them nor the time to enjoy them? I was ruminating upon this when I passed a bank of televisions all tuned coincidentally to the solution to my exact problem.</p><p>My city, it seemed, had loosened parking restrictions. Anything at a short wheelbase would get to park for <i>half price</i>. I was never one to pass up a deal, and so I hatched a plan to kill two birds with two extremely rusty imported cars. Besides, we needed the team driving practice.</p><p>With my codriver and I, we parallel drifted our supercharged two-stroke, rear-engined Suzuki Cervos into a curb space, parking just obnoxiously enough that an SUV could not slip in to ding our panels. It was for the best: with the amount of rust holes I found on the panels of these hoopties, it wasn’t like you had to open the door to get inside it if you get my drift.</p><p>There was just one problem: as I emerged from the condo lobby, downpipe in tow, I studied the Cervo’s modest frunk. I looked at the exhaust, then looked at the frunk, then looked at the exhaust. There was no way this was fitting into one car, and I could tell that my teammate, who I had promised a trip to the local burger joint if we could pull this off, was becoming irritated.</p><p>Is it still a good deal if you have to buy a portable chopsaw?</p>

<p>They told me it probably wouldn’t be that easy. They qualified it with “probably” because nobody had ever done it before. I did it. Perhaps they should have been the ones to ask me about how to get on stage at the presidential debates.</p><p>First, the elaborate fiction of being a “decided voter.” I had made my decision a long time ago, and that decision was to do burnouts in the parking lot of my local school rather than go inside and vote for any one of the numerous candidates. Thing is, there is this assumption that there is some vast pool of undecideds that can be swayed either way by the debates. Everyone wants to believe this so badly, to think that our country and our way of life isn’t one impending, looming civil war in the making after another. What harm could my little lie do in the face of that massive one?</p><p>Next, the appearance of the “common man.” They want someone who relates to them. I sweated my way through the screening interviews by way of celebrity gossip anecdotes written on my hand. Luckily, they never asked any questions about the things that made me truly stand out from my fellow civilians. Presumably, someone so bent would never infiltrate the political process in such a way, so there was no reason to even waste everyone’s time asking. Another strike for them, and another feather in my cap.</p><p>Debate night has such ferocity, a throbbing beat of excitement that pulses through everyone involved. Anchors banter about the spin they expect to see. The crowd tries not to get into Jerry Springer fist fights. Green rooms dispense their candidates a few minutes late, pre-loaded with rage and ready to hit their talking points.</p><p>I barely remember any of it. Everything happened for me when the moderator pointed to me and said, “You, normal white adult male. Ask your question.”</p><p>At last, I prepared to stand and read my pre-screened question live for the American people. It still surprises me to this very day that they had not taken more care in weeding me out given what surely were warning signs and alarm bells throughout the entire process. What surprised me even more was to see the moderator not pointing to me, but in fact <i>past</i> me, to the other side of the stage.</p><p>I looked at that other side of the stage now and saw an adversary emerge. From what I had assumed to be a normal white adult male during the pre-screening get-to-know-you luncheon had emerged the clearest signs of The Foe. They had sent their own man, and the moderator was on their side. I felt my fingers tingle and my breath grow shallow even as he rose to emit the question that belied the true nature of his hate to all those assembled.</p><p>“Candidates,” he spoke with a snakelike hiss on the last syllable, “Static or bagged drop for a 1988 VW Rabbit cabriolet?”<br/></p>

<p>Back in the day, when you owned a police radio scanner, the world was your oyster. Juicy gossip, the latest crimes-in-progress, even just a glimpse into a day-to-day that was nothing like yours at all. Then the cops started encrypting their radios, took all that juicy money that was left to prevent terrorists from blowing up the Blockbuster in a town of a thousand people and threw it at Motorola. It went like that for years. My job was made a lot more difficult, but there is always margin for those who can keep up with the times.</p><p>Me? I’m an accident deconstructor. No, you didn’t hear that wrong. I patrol my favourite roads looking for vehicles with particularly valuable salvage, wait for a crash, and then loot the machines of their parts before the cops and paramedics have a chance to arrive. I have a trunk full of electric impacts, each pre-loaded with their own imperial or metric socket and full batteries. It’s no exaggeration to say that I can rip a Grand Prix GXP down to its unibody and have anything valuable (rear shocks, that <i>V8</i>, the staggered front tires) into my trunk in under ten minutes.</p><p>On weekends, my days start at the local Cars &amp; Coffee meets. I know what you’re saying: Mustangs, eh? In reality, Mustangs carry very few re-sellable parts, and when they do crash, it’s into a crowd of witnesses. With my line of work, showing up in someone’s World Star crash video is a terrible idea, even with the latest suite of CCD-damaging ultraviolet privacy software installed in my smart helmet.</p><p>No. What I do is hang down the road a bit, wait until the fatigue of goofing off starts to set in. I wait for the drift to end, for them to jerk the wheel dead straight. Then I pounce.</p><p>The Hellcat Challenger was at the top of my list for a reason, and that reason was that it contained one of my Most Wanted parts: a low-mileage TR6060 6-speed manual transmission. From its massive bellhousing to its overbuilt tailshaft shell, this thing could withstand a bomb. With the kind of engines I was building for the war rigs, a bombproof transmission is exactly what I needed.</p><p>I timed my throttle hit perfectly, the rear drag slicks of the Valiant wrinkling their high-profile meat into the damp tarmac. I was halfway through first gear when the window switch engaged and my wide-open-throttle antics pushed enough squeeze into the cylinders to get me into the quarter panel of the Hellcat in time. He careened into the ditch, helplessly, a pirouette that I hoped would look close enough to a legitimate spinout to the cops to distract them while I put distance between us.</p><p>The owner looked at me in horror, and reached one hand outwards for help through the maze of side-impact airbags which had saved his life. I spat at it: help would not be forthcoming. It was then that I realized the depth of my error: I had miscalculated badly and was filled with regret.</p><p>As I fled the scene, I wondered how I could have been so stupid. Of <i>course</i> it was a ZF 8-speed automatic, I sneered. This country is going to Hell in a handbasket when you can’t even trust a Dodge rolled over in a ditch to have a workable transmission.</p>

<p>It was in no way traditional for me to have partnered with quantum physicists for cutting-edge research into the fourth dimension, but I felt like it was my duty as a citizen of the world. What I knew, what I had discovered in my own time, deserved to be shared with the world. Soon, they would all know my great truth.</p><p>The paper was announced at the conference. We gave a short, perfunctory, utilitarian presentation - it didn’t even have WordArt - and took questions from the crowd. One man, sitting in the front row, was particularly fascinated.</p><p>“This is a question for the fucking freak in the t-shirt with traffic cones on it,” he stated. I stood up, recognizing my <i>de facto</i> name.</p><p>“Yes?” I asked.<br/></p><p>“What was the title of your paper again?”<br/></p><p>I turned to my compatriots, and then back to the questioner.</p><p>“Femtoseconds: the smallest slice of time in our universe, and their relationship to those fucking coin-operated car washes that dick you over when you’re in spot-free rinse.”</p>

<p>RockAuto held my heart in a way that is usually only reserved for cardiothoracic surgeons, but the latter never sent me an email about close-out parts for my latest project car. The deals were so good, in fact, that I could barely stop myself from ordering quite a few of the parts. And oh my, they’re all at the same warehouse?</p><p>A few weeks later, as the UPS guy limped away from my porch, the ratcheting mechanism on his back brace somehow audible even over his groaning, I was left with my discount bounty. I began to unpack box after box, collecting parts in a growing pile next to me.</p><p>It had cost me so much to buy them, but at last I had approximately three million #74 instrument cluster bulbs. Really, I’ll be saving money in the long run, I thought.</p><p>As I stood up, I noticed that the collection of promotional magnets had clustered itself into a singularity, drawing every wrench and prybar from my walls. The thrashing, clanging swell of tools was at first amusing to me, but soon I realized my hubris had once again led to my inexorable downfall.</p><p>My treasured half-inch-drive torque wrench vibrated atop the pile. I sank to my knees as I imagined how far the calibration had drifted.</p>

<p>They said power goes to your head. When I first heard that, I thought that of course they were talking about <i>horse</i>power. Later, I found out it wasn’t even torque. In fact, power came from <i>people</i>, and it was only in my ill-fated automotive death cult that the distinction between the Otto cycle and the autocrat would at last be placed in stark contrast before my eyes.</p><p>If I were to tell you that I started an automotive death cult, you would probably think that was pretty cool. In fact, you might even ask me about all the illicit relationships I’m having with members of my flock. I would look at you in surprise. My look of surprise is because I hadn’t had time to taste the wares of all zero of my female followers because the only thing I got grabby with was a Town Car on meter-high tractor tires that shoots nitrous flames from a hood-mounted carbon-fibre-wrapped steer skull when I upshift.</p><p>It wasn’t all honey and 302s, no: for instance, there were some 460s and also one of my followers, the Reverend Texaco Tigertail, had betrayed me in the most unholy of ways. He had gone to the local dealership and <i>purchased a new car</i>. What’s more, I had reason to believe from my spies working in every major financial institution in the - <i>my</i> - town, he may even have financed it. I could not ignore such an overt insult to the Way of the Third Stroke.</p><p>Locking myself in my compound garage so tightly that not even the sound of impact tools could be heard through the bombproof bunker-grade rebar concrete that made up its walls, I began a work of vengeance that would permanently ensconce me in the minds of any followers who were weak of loyalty. Hours turned into days turned into weeks turned into a blacked-out Dart wagon hoisted aloft on mattracks and skis, a well-scheduled vehicle if ever I had built one.</p><p>Why well-scheduled? In the weeks it had taken me to construct the Work Of Dart, a soft winter had fallen upon my people, and now they were risking starvation. I walked into the compound’s sleeping quarters, and instead of faith found the disgruntled appearance of the faithless.</p><p>My labour had taken so long that they had lost sight of what truly mattered - hunting down Texaco Tigertail and rending the flesh from his skull with the aid of a Spicer joint spinning at not more than four thousand RPM (to go above was a sign of the hated Rear-Mounted European-Style Transaxle, so spake the Way of the Third Stroke). Indeed, they were angry at me for not having provided food, shelter, running water and electricity. Many had already left, the remaining few explained, and were lost to me forever.</p><p>As I fled into the night atop the Dart snowcat, I knew that this was somehow Texaco Tigertail’s fault, too: during the months that I ignored them, he slipped in to put poison in their ears. I would find a new town, a new garage compound, and I would revitalize the Way with new followers, and perhaps this time one of them should be a trustworthy lieutenant. Truth be told, I just did not like to share my tools.</p>

<p>My training was excellent. They had reinforced into me through constant drilling (both metaphorical and very, <i>very</i> phorical) that I was to assess my present situation, decide on a plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with brutal efficiency.</p><p>Present situation: I just rolled a surplus-auction Crown Victoria Police Interceptor through the lobby of a Hyundai dealership. The surviving salesmen are beginning to crowd the vehicle, asking their own reflections in the somehow mirror-perfect clearcoat if they would like to trade in this vehicle for a new Veracruz. What the hell even is a Veracruz? I’ve never seen one.</p><p>Plan of action: Kick out the door glass, puncture the trachea of whoever seems to be in charge, flee in the ensuing confusion. I make it happen, and within seconds a man with a nametag that says only Duane is now breathing through a manmade cold air intake. His adiabatic efficiency is off the charts - he should thank me - and soon I find myself in the used car lot. From the frying pan to the fire, I think, as the dealership’s platoon of used car salesmen take notice of my bewildered expression and assume I must be here to purchase a minivan, their chants about premium undercoating growing in pitch to a hysterical din of cult sacrifice.</p><p>I am halfway through executing my second plan of action when the lights and sirens close in. It was all a ploy, a distraction. Hyundai isn’t even a real car company, the Feds made it up so they could rope me in. As the handcuffs go on and they push me into the cruiser (a shameful Ford Explorer Interceptor), I see the scarred face of Inspector Koshiro looking on from the crowd.</p><p>Sure, I lied to him when I told him I’d treat his old patrol car with respect, but in my defence it’s really hard to not ramp a bitch after you spent all that time and sawzall blades putting mud terrains under it.</p>

<p>Insurance is one of those great pains of life. You gotta have it, or so the nice police officers keep telling me. I don’t have to like it, though: there’s just something about those beady-eyed suits looking over reams of actuarial tables trying to figure out how to make a so-safe-it’s-stupid bet that gets me right in the craw, I’m telling you. And so it was with the self-driving cars.</p><p>At first it was pretty simple. They said, put this module into your car so we can keep an eye on the computer. Make sure it’s being well maintained and is super safe, keep your software patches up to date. Of course, that cut their risk to zero, while they still collected a heapin’ helpin’ of cash like in the Bad Old Days of multi-million hyperdeaths on every expressway and playground zone, but we didn’t mind. It was just what we did, and so we continued to do it.</p><p>Imagine our surprise when we found out what that module really did. Computer scientists hired by the insurance companies went rogue, described in very small words to confused morning-television news jockeys about how the modules influenced which victims a car that was out of control would choose to save, and which it would choose to kill.</p><p>Somehow, these “morality pods” came pre-loaded with every unconscious and conscious bias the insurance companies had ever developed. Things we had observed began to make sense: obviously it explained why self-driving cars preferred to hit less expensive cars rather than the top-of-the-line models. What we didn’t realize until later was that if you ever gave an autonomous car a chance and a skid on the ice, it would choose to wipe out the least litigious of the pedestrians ninety-nine times out of a hundred.</p><p>Our commentators and politicians told us: we need to look <i>more litigious</i>. We need to sue the shit out of everything in sight. Walk down the road screaming at every passing car about how big of an asshole your shark lawyer is. Construct armour made of hastily-printed QR codes pointing to accident-injury attorneys. Make your house look like a <i>court</i>house. Well, maybe that last one was just me.</p><p>At last, we were safe from the self-driving cars. They only ran over difficult-to-understand foreigners and people who were visibly too poor to afford lawyers. Meanwhile, our grocery stores were filled with people screaming at each other until their faces became blue.</p><p>You could not let something as dangerous as a puddle or a flickering light bulb go, lest the cars discover we were faking it all this time.</p>

<p>I was borrowing tools from a friend when I heard that all too familiar refrain. “Buying more tools sucks because then you have to move them when you move to a bigger garage,” he said to me. That got me thinking, and I’m nothing if not entrepreneurial.</p><p>My first customer has an appointment booked at the crack of dawn. He stands in his driveway, waiting for me to arrive and take his most critical tools and spare car parts to the new home. The lake pipes jutting from the hood of the Gladiator are in full dieselsong now, bursting clouds of flaming ashy soot into the atmosphere as aided by the Shop Vac-sized ball bearing turbocharger hanging off each of its exhaust manifolds.</p><p>I pull the hydraulic handbrake, drifting the truck on its trophy-truck long-arm suspension across his driveway and placing the bed directly into the line of fire. Two more switches on the brushed-stainless dashboard-replacement activate the hydraulic engine-hoist crane in the bed, and I step outside to zap-strap the crane arm to the spare 440 he meant to put into a car any day now but never got around to.</p><p>Minutes later, I am embarking on the highway with a wildly cheering new homeowner, tandem trailers of parts cars in tow, my hands flurrying over the twin-stick Eaton nine speed like a chopstick factory technician on his sixth Red Bull of the morning.</p><p>I drop off his stuff, and he is extremely pleased. He asks me what my fee is, and I motion to the last of the parts cars. Nodding happily, he agrees to the exchange. It makes me feel good, to not only help out the automotive community but also getting rid of their clutter. Besides, now I have an excuse to have a nice tow vehicle.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, we always wondered what had happened to my older brother Carmelo. One warm spring day, we were playing in the field of a nearby farmhouse when he saw it.</p><p>I would later identify “it” as a 1987 AMC Eagle, but at the time I had never seen anything like it and was terrified, rooted to the ground through cold fear shooting through my veins. Carmelo, though, he wasn’t afraid. He went right into the weeds after that AMC Eagle, and he never came back.</p><p>We waited there for hours, the sun growing low in the sky and finally disappearing behind the mantle of Earth. Our parents, terrified, arranged a search party. No trace could be found.</p><p>Once, when we were on a family vacation, I saw someone I swore could be Carmelo, in a parking lot. He was sitting on the street corner, had a two foot long mountain beard, and was muttering angrily to himself, or perhaps to some demons. His hands were busy as ever, the knotted and scarred fingers rebuilding an air locker with components scavenged from Safeway shopping cart coin locks. I called my parents over, but by the time they had gotten there he had disappeared without my notice, and I smelled only a lilting fragrance of burning heavy-weight gear oil on the air where he had left.</p><p>Now that I’m grown up, I recognize my lost older brother’s ways in the occasional news item. A daring daylight heist of an off-road parts store, the kidnapping and torture of New Venture powertrain engineers.</p><p>One morning, a friend appeared with a Jeep J10 “Honcho.” It had a lovingly bobbed bed, the primer over its weld scars applied with care. I saw his handiwork immediately, and white faced, asked my friend where he had gotten it.</p><p>“This dude named Carmelo,” he said, looking scared. “He seemed a lot like you.”<br/></p><p>I followed his recollections and came across a shack in the woods, surrounded by a fence of worthless Dana 30s sunken into the ground at half-meter intervals, XJ dashboard wiring harnesses strung between them like improvised barbed wire. Inside the shack, a stove was still warm, the boiling water in its sole mild-tin pot holding a wheel bearing. <i>He was just here</i>, I thought, and then everything went black.</p>

<p>It was like the soothsayers of lore said: a man who is rich in flatheads is rich indeed. But what does it mean to be rich in flatheads, I ask you while walking towards the camera, stabbing my hands at the air for emphasis? Does it simply mean to have a <i>lot</i> of flatheads? A lot of <i>pairs</i> of flatheads? And what about flathead <i>sixes</i>?</p><p>To get the answer to these questions and more, I consulted a local member of a religious order. It was fairly easy: he had office hours and all I had to do was drop in and sit in a little booth for awhile before asking him a question.</p><p>“Is a flathead six inherently noble?” I asked him, and I could tell from the gap under the stall walls that he was aware of my question.<br/></p><p>“Uh, are you talking to me?” he asked in reply.<br/></p><p>Was this some kind of strange non-psychologist attempt to get me to open up further, to analyze the concept of what I was doing? <i>Talking</i>? Or was I discovering? This guy was good, I thought.</p><p>“I am speaking to you now, man to man, to ask you about whether a flathead V8 is nobler than a flathead six. Is not fuel efficiency part of the Bible you claim to worship?”<br/></p><p>“Buddy, this is a bus station bathroom,” he grumbled, emphasizing the statement with a thump of the stall wall with his fist. “I’m not a priest.”</p>

<p>There was a time before I coveted the plastic picnic table that came in the trunk area of all first-generation Honda CR-Vs. I remember it like it was yesterday, because it was probably yesterday afternoon that I stumbled across the prices that they went for on eBay. Now, I was at the junkyard, fully expecting to find rows of mommywagons sporting the OEM sports-utility kitsch that would make me a rich man.</p><p>“Take me to the Honda CR-Vs, my good man,” I said to the guy working the interchange computer, and was rewarded with a furrowed brow as he hunt-and-pecked each letter of “H O N D E” into the computer with a relentless focus.</p><p>My junkyard partner, Rusty Dan, began to squirm. I could tell that he thought less of me for using the interchange computer, a crutch installed into the yard by its corporate management in a half-baked attempt to increase their appeal with the “normals” who didn’t even know enough to fill their pockets with leftover bolts, much less memorize the entire interchange list for their family of badge-engineered daily drivers. I paid him no mind - our friendship had been durable enough that we were no longer trading mutual respect but instead were now dreading having to untangle our respective loaned tools from one another’s collection if anything drastic were to happen.</p><p>At last, the clerk smiled, and told me that I would find one of the CR-Vs in the middle of the yard. When I approached it, I could tell from a distance that the picnic table was gone, because the CR-V was lunched from the C-pillar backward in what looked to be the world’s highest-speed reversing accident.</p><p>A “normal” was there, trying to fit an SAE socket onto a 10mm bolt underhood. He smiled and greeted us warmly, and I could tell immediately what his game was. In the outside world, he was no doubt a man of great power, capable of forcing underlings into doing the menial work he did not care for. His folly was trying the same thing here, expecting us to help out of some kind of common sense of decency.</p><p>Though Rusty Dan was already doing a U-turn and leaving the SUV row in search of a Chevy Sprint Turbo’s eponymous RHB3, I saw an opportunity and smiled back at the man.</p><p>In the parking lot of the junkyard, the man thanked me for my skillful labour in helping him liberate the MAP sensor. While he was distracted underhood fitting it to the CR-V he had driven to the yard in, I reached through his open drivers’ window for the hatch release.</p>

<p>Ahhh, Switzerland. The crisp mountain air. The vaguely racist populist demagoguery. The banks which don’t tell anyone anything until they get threatened a little and then tell everyone everything. I was well familiar, and not just because of my aborted run at a career in the banking sector which ended with me setting fire to a training centre filled with screaming MBAs.</p><p>We had history, but that didn’t matter. I was here for a <i>mission</i>.</p><p>My partner and I were badge engineers. Whenever you had a car, we would figure out a way to sell it as another, <i>different</i> car, perhaps in a different market segment, or appealing to a different ethnicity. If we did our job right, the first time you’d hear about us is when a nasally-voiced guy at the Pick N Pull tells you about the interchange options between your esteemed reliable-chariot-of-suburban-soccer-mommage Toyota Matrix and the beneath-white-trash Pontiac Vibe. Yeah, that was one of ours. You’re welcome.</p><p>Like I said, I was here for a mission. My partner phoned me in a panic from the Zurich airport, recited from memory a string of unbroken base64. When I decoded it, I could not believe my eyes. I booked a ticket immediately, and now I was here.</p><p>My partner was standing there, waiting for me. We nodded at each other. No words were needed. He was to take me directly to what he had found.</p><p>In the carpark sat the origin of our torment. Somehow, unknown to us, rival badge-engineering forces had abducted America’s most-loved modular soft-roader, that being the International Scout. They clawed at its panels, yanking them free from the frame. It lost its doglike charm that day. Enriched by a heady mix of high-octane cocaine, personal shoppers and fattened day-trading accounts with the best Swiss brokerages, they decided that the true destiny of a thirteen-letter shit-spreader laid in <i>luxury</i>.</p><p>I looked over the sea of taut leather interior, my trained eyes falling onto a switch - my god, it had <i>power windows</i>, the maniacs - and the bulbous gear selector jutting from its automatic transmission. I could hear those alpine bastards laughing at us even now as we looked over their masterwork, the Monteverdi Safari.</p><p>The panic attack I had been working myself up to ever since I got on the plane only broke when my partner reached through an open window and started the engine. I recognized the groaning workaday warble of a Mopar 318 rattling itself on worn motor mounts beneath the hood, and became calm. In fact, I became downright jovial, and I soon found myself laughing so hard I found it difficult to catch my breath.</p><p>Switzerland always <i>was</i> neutral.</p>

<p>It’s hard to find good accountants these days, and when mine started coming to me with wild-eyed rambles about their obsession with “profits” and “EBITDA” I had to take some corrective action. This is <i>America</i>, pal, and we build two things: V8s and infrastructure debt.</p><p>However, there was one thing they screamed as my loyal guards beat them senseless with truncheons that stuck in my craw, and it intrigued me. Indeed, I had to look deeper into these so-called “small-displacement economy cars.” I found a lot to like.</p><p>At the introductory gala, the assembled crowd oohed and aahed at the cornucopia of lockable storage bins that studded the interior - enough to keep a thief so busy you will have time to return with your pumpkin spice latte and a loaded .38, I proudly stated for the media. They cawed when I told them about the unique carbon-fibre unibody, which chopped chassis weight for maximum fuel economy while also resisting rust. I told them that these were critical problems for the common man, and saw no dissent.</p><p>There was something missing, though. I knew that this car had to be for the <i>people</i>, but all I found before me at this glitzy do-up was the bourgeoisie. How I despised them and their jingling jewelry, having risen from my poor farmchild upbringing through a combination of tactical business deals and well timed industrial-equipment accidents. Their cryptofascist opinions would confuse my product planners, leak classist poison into the veins of this fine automobile, perhaps forever, taking it out of reach of the common man and putting me one step further away from Godhood. That just would not do.</p><p>I hit the auto show circuit. Personally. My PR representative had angry words to say about it, specifically at the auto show as I pulled the PA microphone away from him and doled out a jaw-shattering roundhouse kick that arced his unconscious body elegantly aloft from the podium. As a self-made man, I would now address those men who had not made themselves and find out their truths.</p><p>My sideshow patter hadn’t lost even a single beat of tempo since I quit my job at the circus and told my two-faced (and two-headed) boss to stuff it up one of his many assholes. I was on fire, calling the people around and showing them the monster that I planned to put under their beds (namely, in their attractively-furnished, drywalled double-oversized front attached garages).</p><p>Finally, one man decided that he had had enough of my honeyed words and climbed atop the podium, crazed-eyed, like a child dying of thirst mere inches away from the astronaut-mixed joy of Tang pseudofruit cocktail. He wanted it. He <i>needed</i> it. I grinned as his claw-like fingers, nails stained with the grease of a blue-collar job, grabbed furiously at the sheet covering my masterpiece of proletariat automotive conveyance.</p><p>He pulled the sheet aside and the crowd gasped. Sitting beneath the klieg lights sat a shimmering black insect, hostile and brutal to the world outside of it. Overfenders bristled from the quarters, covering the 300-width semi-slicks that proudly jutted from its suspension.</p><p>“What’s that on the top?” the man screamed at me once his breath had returned.<br/></p><p>“Funny you should ask,” I told him. “Because fuel economy is so important to the average commuter, this Weiand roots blower makes up for the relative lack of displacement of the all-aluminum overhead-cam V8.”<br/></p><p>He looked into the blower’s street scoop, captivated by the gleaming rotors that laid within. I smiled broadly and gestured to the crowd. “I think I just made my first sale,” I barked with a chuckle.</p><p>They didn’t laugh back.</p><p>“How are we supposed to afford $250,000 for an economy car?” asked a woman in the crowd, clutching her child close lest they become infected with the strain of madness that shot through my veins at this very moment.<br/></p><p>“Well, you can <i>finance</i> it. It’s just 500 easy monthly payments of $600 per month.”</p><p>The crowd burst into riotous cheering. I was jostled from my position as the most ambitious or most obsequious - I cared not for the difference - of the audience members climbed aboard the podium in order to kiss the hand of their newborn King.</p><p>Months later, I was on the cover of all the magazines. Who <i>was</i> this brash young entrepreneur who had finally squared the circle of affordability, luxury and sports performance? I would smile, hoping it would become somehow visible in print, and let them know about the secret of financing aspirations.</p><p>What I hadn’t seen coming was the competition. Once my strategy had been pushed out into the open, nothing stopped Ford from producing the twin-V10, sequential-quad-turbocharged Focus of my grocery getting dreams. Yet somehow I was still happy. Perhaps it was because my other secret weapon was buying things for a thousand dollars after the depreciation hit.</p><p>I looked out over my driveway stuffed with miled-out all-wheel-drive, forced-induction carbon-fibre oh-so-practical deathmachines, and smiled. Despite what my accountants said, only a man who is rich in beaters is truly rich.</p>

<p>A lot of people lose their marbles when they get cut off in traffic. Not me, though. I have a foolproof technique for preventing road rage. Let me tell you a little bit about it by way of an example.</p><p>One day, I was driving proudly on the freeway when I was cut off rudely by a luxury sports sedan. To make things worse, they did not use their turn signals to indicate their intent prior to the lane change. A normal person would have gotten mad, but I liked to think of myself as the “Dr. Phil” of road rage. Instead of a stream of do-nothing profanity, we would have a productive conversation, man to man.</p><p>I flicked a switch, allowing the clutch on the heinous blower to engage. Burying the throttle let me pull alongside with the sports sedan trivially. The owner looked over, noticing how strange it was to have a tan Camry wagon with a Roots supercharger the size of a beer keg sticking out of its hood next to it. His eyes continued down the flanks of the car, all the way to my open passenger window, where a jagged harpoon jutted from the top of the door skin.</p><p>I waved and smiled, then depressed the trigger.</p><p>It’s very peaceful next to a roaring car fire that used to be the weapon of a guy who cut you off in traffic. I knelt down, and looked in the eyes of the driver as he crawled from the wreckage, bloodied and crazed.</p><p>“Sorry, I forgot to use my indicators.” I said, innocently.</p>

<p>When the Foundation sent me to this remote outpost, I went along with it. You didn’t want to piss off the Foundation. They drilled that concept into you in training, thousands of flickery 35mm projected films with warbling audio tracks about their reach. We can find you anywhere, they said.</p><p>Good luck finding me out here, I muttered to myself while throwing a playing card into a hat. It was becoming all too apparent that my temporary post was becoming permanent. For the sake of some project or another, I would sit here for the rest of my life. I was no fool, though, and I brought along a project to work on. The Duster could be spotted in amongst the blowing snow, sitting forlornly in the crooked wooden carport. All I had to do was wait for the winter to end, and I could wrench to my heart’s content - and get <i>paid</i> for it.</p><p>Weeks turned into months, and still the blizzard would not let up. When the ionosphere smiled upon me, I could get intermittent, staticky weather reports on the emergency transistor radio. The only thing that was clear about the automated broadcasts was that it wasn’t going to end anytime soon. At night, the cabin creaked as it settled beneath the assault of the outside world. Even through the wind, I could hear the Duster complaining about its list of minor maintenance. I salivated with the chance to reunite with it once more, just as soon as this job was done.</p><p>Finally, I could take it no more. The cabin throbbed at my temples, seeming to grow tighter around my body by the second. I burst out of the front door, toolbag in hand, determined to wrench on the Duster. No sooner had I popped the hood than a figure approached from the snow and pointed a gun at me. I groaned, knowing that of course <i>this</i> would be when I had to do actual work.</p>

<p>I picked up the phone, and instead of a dial tone, my literary agent was on the other end. I’m not entirely sure I had hung up all the way during our last conversation, and presumably they had just been going this entire time, without sleep, water or food for at least a week or two. What they had to say intrigued me.</p><p>“Our market researchers have found that there’s a strong preference for true-life technothrillers,” said the disembodied voice, “with <i>lots of detail</i>.”<br/></p><p>That was all I had to hear. I returned the phone to the hook, and fired up my electric typewriter by way of pulling the fraying ripcord jutting from its two-stroke thumper. By the time the rings caught, I was already halfway through hammering out a page with my free hand. Easy money, I told myself and later my ex-wife’s lawyer, easy money indeed.</p><p>A few months later, I was flying to Dallas to pick up a used NB Miata with only a small amount of rod knock. I decided to stop in at the airport bookstore to see how my new work was doing.</p><p>“TOM CLANKY’S OPERATION: HEATER CORE” was front and centre, including a cardboard standee of the long-dead military aviation expert that I had been impersonating under my ghostwriting contract. I noticed that a pair of jovial business associates were standing at the counter, and one of them was buying the book - <i>my</i> book. Naturally, I followed them and overheard their conversation.<br/></p><p>“This is the <i>best</i> description of the BMW E36 cooling system I’ve ever read in print,” said the more senior of the two executives. He had probably gotten a copy on release night, devoured it while waiting for a layover. I practically bristled with excitement. My literary agent was right: I had a <i>fan</i>.</p><p>Within a few years, I had become pigeonholed, stuck in my ways. Contract after contract from my publisher was met merely by doing a “Select All” on a PDF of the factory service manual and pasting it into Word. The audience loved it, and could not get enough. That’s when I met Bob Haynes, the president of Haynes, and also made my acquaintance with the aluminum baseball bat collection he carried at all times in the trunk of his 1990 Mercury Cougar XR7.</p>

<p>On the first of many trips to Japan, I located a bar which had a dissected 1MZ hanging over its door. Taking this as a good omen, I wandered in. Halfway through my pint, I found the locals starting to eye me up. I started to become self-conscious, a foreigner in a land that he didn’t belong.</p><p>Finally, the largest of the group got up and sat next to me. I tried to ignore him, but he tapped me on the shoulder. Looking over at him, I saw that he had an expression of nervous energy on his face. Perhaps he had been dared by his friends to ask the foreigner a stupid question?</p><p>He pointed at a wrinkled piece of paper he clutched in his hand. On it was an image I could not forget, had flown thousands of kilometers to get away from. It figured that such a thing would find me here.</p><p>“The 2006 Pontiac Grand Am is the pinnacle of motoring perfection,” he said, almost too smoothly, as if quoting from some half-remembered television ad.<br/></p><p>“Can you order us Sunfire parts?” shouted another from the back, clutching a pool cue with both hands anxiously.<br/></p><p>I looked up from the bar, and realized the error of my ways. Hanging smugly above the pub’s entryway was not a 1MZ-FE after all, but a 60 degree 3400. I was in a <i>Pontiac</i> bar.</p>

<p>Planning a heist involving entirely first-generation Nissan Homy minibuses was no easy feat. Having to do it in the middle of the 21st century, several decades after the last of those vans were collapsed into Japanokorean dishwashers, was only a little harder.</p><p>Over the years, I’d come to know a lot of people. The qualities I looked for in my friends were that they were brilliant and that nobody ever listened to them. One of those people, which the attached literature does not mention by name, had developed a carbon-fibre 3D printer for Boeing. This thing was the size of a house, and it could spin an entire airplane wing in just under two hours, the occult intelligence within seeming almost shrouded by the deafening clatter of its billions of spider-limbs rattling over a central loom the thickness of a telephone pole. Boeing had a pretty big problem on their hands: namely, that I showed up with a six pack in the middle of the night and had him spin me Homy after Homy.</p><p>That took care of the cars. Assembling functional automobiles from nothing more than a Wikipedia photo and trillions of lines of machine-thought microcode was one thing, but assembling a team that worked together was much, much harder. Luckily, I never found a tough problem I couldn’t cheat through. I picked up my phone and had an entire team assembled before I even had to scroll the contacts list. That feat is doubly impressive if you’ve ever seen my contacts list, because my mom is first in that list and the Subaru dealership’s parts desk is second.</p><p>Neon rain hung suspended over the storefronts in great clouds, the ground slick with perfect mirrors. Even those passersby who were not into cars had some pattern-matching component of their simian mind realize just how unusual it was for a set of Nissans to have zero visible underbody rust, and they stared. This, I had not planned for. I made a mental note to add more imperfections, maybe hit the quarter panels with iron oxide primer to give them that lived-in look. Or perhaps they were staring at the smart loom’s crude approximation of chrome - something extremely difficult to render in carbon-fibre. The overall sensation of the near-chrome was unsettling to our eyes, and I found myself tearing my eyes away from the steering wheel and dashboard trim whenever the licks of nausea started at my throat. We’ll never know.</p><p>What I did know was that our heist was successful. We had won Concours d’LeMons with a team of the best-kept worst cars imaginable. The judges, those of who still remained conscious after taking a long look at the Homy’s unsettling dog-shaped wing mirrors, concurred that if we went to this much effort, it must have been worth it.</p>

<p>There’s something sad when you meet old friends. Oftentimes, both of you have moved on and were no longer the people you once were. All you can do is talk about the history you shared together, maybe some meaningless platitudes about the future, and then depart. It’s as if a man can live several lifetimes.</p><p>I was thinking about this very thing when I met my old high school friend at a dive bar last week. Together, we had turned SAE wrenches on domestic garbage, metric wrenches on Japanese garbage, and our best convoluted multi-axis swivel-nut inverse rejoinder wrenches on German garbage. He had changed, though. He was pushing some <i>Swedish</i> garbage. I just didn’t know it at the time.</p><p>“You should get a Saab 9-2X, man. It’s a Subaru, but <i>weirder</i>.”<br/></p><p>That was all it took. A <i>weirder</i> Subaru? The company that made not one but two car-based pickup trucks, decades apart? There was room in their repertoire to have gotten <i>weirder</i>?</p><p>I decided to overlook the (peeling) logo and picked one up posthaste. It was cheaper than an Impreza, and had the low insurance premiums that was surely a result of its ownership by tweed-wearing professors of English history. The only problem was that it had a few one-off pieces that weren’t shared with the regular Impreza, and those were becoming scarce indeed.</p><p>Before long, I found that I had acquired a parts Saab. And then another.</p><p>While I was working in my driveway furiously swapping one-off panels from car to car, a neighbour approached. He was wearing tweed, and his demeanour was now welcoming, rather than his usual sneer.</p><p>“You are <i>ready</i>,” is all he said, and then he left a key in my hand. It said “SAAB.”</p><p>At the end of the street laid a two-stroke Saab 95. I looked back at the four-stroke Saabarus in my driveway. They seemed to pale in high weirdness before my very eyes. Looking back at the 95, it glowed in the afternoon sun with an eerie light.</p><p>I found myself inside the Saab, putting the key into an unfamiliar position, between the front seats. Perhaps not unfamiliar. Now, somehow, it felt <i>right</i>. It was the correct way to build a car. I knew this now.</p><p>That night, another friend visited, saw the cars, and realized what had happened. He tried to tell me that with the 9-2X I had been slipped a <i>gateway</i> Saab, and this is how they got new addicts for their dark project. Through teary eyes, he made the call for help.</p><p>They came too late to save me, I knew. As my neighbour was hauled away in chains by the EPA death squads, all I could think of was whether he had a Tech 2 in his parts pile.</p>

<p>Somehow, I had managed to score the hot ticket for Saturday night. There was a <i>focus group</i> in town, and even after I realized it had nothing to do with getting my hands on some dent-free SVT wheels, I was still excited. It was about cars, of course, and they wanted to know <i>my</i> opinion.</p><p>The application’s final question asked for a “dream car.” I affixed my description of the perfect automobile and waited by the phone for a callback. Soon, I would have two hundred and seventy five dollars, and have influenced the craft of automaking forevermore.</p><p>When the call finally came, I thought it was strange that they summoned me to an industrial warehouse on the bad side of town. I parked the Valiant, its white-hot side pipes still popping the occasional piece of combustible effluent that drifted lazily from the leaking injectors, in front of the building and walked inside. My footfalls echoed on the damp industrial-chic tile and echoed through the woodgrain hallways of the office front.</p><p>Eventually, I came to the end of a hallway and faced a door, light peeking through the hinge gap. I opened the door, and stepped inside. There was an older gentleman sitting at a card table, beneath an incandescent light bulb swinging lazily from an overhead cable.</p><p>No one man ever admitted to be the lead designer of the AMC Eagle. No, he preferred to keep himself in the shadows, away from those who could not understand him. I knew who he was the second I walked in.</p><p>“So,” he started, with a twinkle in his eye not unlike the Santa Claus of myth, “I hear you like my work.”<br/></p><p>I smiled, and looked at my feet while I shuffled them out of shyness. He continued.</p><p>“Throughout history, we at the American Motor Company have often needed a personable public face in order to advance our cause. George Romney was the last of our puppets, and he wounded us greatly with his betrayal to the dreaded French conspiracy of Renault. They told us we had to make <i>a front-wheel-drive family sedan</i>.”</p><p>He coughed, leaving a thin mist of red behind on the hand he used to cover his mouth. “It got so bad we had to use the Chinese escape hatch in the hopes that our patents and designs could continue to evolve in a foreign land, far from the eyes of our enemies. But now we are strong again, and we need a new spokesman, who can lend legitimacy and sales to our engineering.”</p><p>He stood, booming now. “Together, we will rip iron from the earth and we will make the <i>weirdest fucking car that America has ever seen</i>.”</p><p>I could take it no longer. I had been living a lie.</p><p>“Actually, I much prefer the SX/4,” I offered with an aw-shucks shrug, “but I figured the focus group company would have only heard of the <i>mainstream</i> AMCs.”</p><p>That was a mistake.</p><p>The room seemed to grow deeper as the Eagle’s designer howled in a wounded rage, cleaving the pool table in twain where his grasp tightened on it. I clawed helplessly at the door behind me in a vain attempt to escape. Just as the Designer was upon me, claws and fangs at eye height, I remembered that I had brought a totem of power with me.</p><p>I struck him in the face with a Subaru sales brochure. He took one look at the Subaru SVX, and I could see in his eyes he knew he had been utterly beaten.</p><p>As he faded away, released at last from this plane of existence, I swore I could sense an expression of satisfaction on the Designer’s face.</p><p>I had lied to him. The tall AMC which had stolen my heart went by the half-whispered name <i>Kammback</i>, but nobody would believe that.</p>

<p>One day, I told my accountant Roy as he counted thousands of dollars in petty cash from the admission turnstille’s lockbox, all this will end. He looked at me with sad eyes, then emitted a heavy sigh. Of course he knew it too, he seemed to be saying. Neither one of us knew just how soon it would end.</p><p>The idea was solid: I had seen a late-night television commercial for a special amusement park dedicated to industrial equipment. Your son or daughter could go to the park, run around like an asshole, and then hop inside a steam shovel and demolish a hill made of gravel, all under the watchful eye of professional heavy equipment operators. It was an idea so pure it hit me like a diamond fired from a gun.</p><p>There was just one thing to do, and in the great spirit of American entrepreneurship it was basically exactly the thing I had just seen, except watered down a bit.</p><p>I want you to imagine some kind of swelling orchestral score as a very expensive camera does a very long dolly shot over a mountain. It settles on a dirt field filled with cars. We call it <i>Beaterland</i>.</p><p>For years I had been looking for a way to get rid of spare cars. This was a great method: simply leave them in a field and charge children a few bucks to paddock-bash around with them. Sure, there were lots of dented panels and bent subframes, but it’s not like that wouldn’t have happened anyway. They just became parts cars a little early.</p><p>My downfall was unexpected. Apparently, according to Big Government, it is illegal to force a bunch of eight-year-olds to rebuild carburetors for you for free. Yes, even if it <i>is</i> fun. I know, right?</p>

<p>There were no atheists in foxholes, a kindly pastor had told me, but I wasn’t listening to him. No, I was looking over his shoulder at the tasty ‘63 Squareback he had parked in the pastors-only, everyone-else-gets-towed spot at the edge of the church lot. I never figured out what his point was - well, I figured out what his <i>points</i> were, inside the Bosch 009 dizzy protruding from its sad pancake - but my time at the dealership pushed me closer to understanding it than ever before.</p><p>No two ways about it: I needed money. Not just for my parts addiction, but for food and water and mortgages and all the other shit I assumed were just taken care of for me by some kind of government agency dedicated to keeping dangerous stupids like myself off the streets. I had to get a job, and it probably had to be about cars, lest I get those cold-turkey shakes like that day and a half on the business trip in Germany where I had to ride a train.</p><p>“Welcome aboard,” said the reptile wearing a cheap one-piece suit. I was the latest jackbooted sales operative of the Henderson Toyota product-pushing operation. <i>New</i> cars, I said to my coworker (Ted, I think) on my first coffee break, that’ll never catch on. Ted looked at me in amazement, told me that cars have been being sold new to regular people just off the street for hundreds of years. I scoffed, and returned to the floor to meet a young couple getting ready to spend at least forty Neon ACRs on a Highlander.</p><p>“You’re gonna love this thing,” I said, popping the hood. “It’s got an easy to remove oil filter, and it comes in brown. Plus I’m pretty sure all of the tires are still intact. It’s in like-new condition, but I’d ask the seller to knock it down a few grand.”</p><p>“Does it have cooled seats?” asked the husband, attempting what I assumed was some kind of abstract negotiation tactic - asking for something that does not exist in order to get a better deal on something that did? I was going to have to ask the GM afterward, see if he had a handbook or something I could find the counters to this consumerist Judo in.<br/></p><p>They moved me to used cars. It was probably a better choice, I said to their angry faces at the time. Now that people were bringing me cars to look at and judge for them, I would surely be on my way to lowballing people on beaters <i>professionally</i>.</p><p>I am still convinced that diesel Tempo was some kind of plant, an attempt to get me out of the company before bonus season. Who could resist being able to have that fine-ass four-speed all to himself, even if you had to cut out some pricks at the dealer who wouldn’t appreciate it first?</p>

<H1>An Open Letter to City Management</H1>
<p>Dear City Management,</p><p>In recent years I have noticed that the quality of my fellow drivers has dropped off substantially. The police have noted that it is likely due to texting and driving, but I feel that the cause is much simpler. It is my belief that the average commuter is simply bored.</p><p>I believe that if we raise the excitement level of those drivers, they will pay more attention to the road. Indeed, I expect that they will become much more talented and inquisitive about further improving their driving skills, leading to a further decrease in accident rates.</p><p>As well, you may be aware that the economy exists. I am told that at least part of this economy is performance suspension components. Nothing would stimulate this economy more than having that guy on my commute with the broken swaybar kick five bucks towards a parts store to buy a new one because otherwise he will roll off the outside of a turn and into a flaming crater.</p><p>

Please change all roads between my house and my office into tight acute angles. No longer do I wish to take any corner on my commute at less than one full turn of my steering wheel.</p><p>

Critics of my plan have frequently documented it as “inhumane,” “infeasible,” “inane,” and other “in-” adjectives. I refuse to accept their limited view of the world, and I feel as I bulldoze their pricey megamansions surrounding downtown in order to install a kilometer-long succession of increasingly difficult chicanes, they will come around to my way of seeing things. </p><p>I look forward to our future correspondence as we embark upon this plan for our great City together.</p>

<p>There’s a thing about liberal guilt, and it leads you sometimes to making choices that, in retrospect, should have been more conservative. I am talking, of course, about the time we let some strange foreign refugees live in my neighbourhood and lower my property values.</p><p>When we first let them in, they seemed like responsible, sane adults. Sure, they had a few strange religious rites, the women dressed funnily, and their children spoke to them only in a peculiar language, but those things were necessary to overlook when it came to nurturing a community. Our similarities as human beings would pull us together.</p><p>After awhile, it was clear that they were forming their own insular community. Their lawns became crammed with junk, they had long meetings behind closed doors, and they eyed us suspiciously as we came near. Finally, I could take it no more. Best intentions be damned, I would figure out what they were up to.</p><p>I went to the ringleader’s house, rang the doorbell and then kicked in the door. What I saw shocked me to my very bones.</p><p>The entire kitchen was filled with Ford 302s in various states of repair, camshafts of many lifts lying scattered across the grease-spattered linoleum. What our conservative Camaro-driving community paranoids had said would happen came true.</p><p>In the end, even though the Fox body Mustang owners were pushed out of their native Dearborn by electric cars and settled in our accommodating bowtie town, they could not fully discard their heritage.</p><p>After that day, many of them would move on in anger, leaving me with a deep sense of shame for not making a better effort to accommodate them. Perhaps I could have built an ‘88 Notch with an LS3, I thought, reach out to those in their community who had not yet been claimed by reactionary fundamentalism.</p>

<p>When I heard about the Hanjin bankruptcy, I knew there would be some really good deals on only slightly rusty cars. “Really good deals on only slightly rusty cars” just happened to be my middle name. In my excitement, I threw the newspaper directly into the kitchen’s overhead ceiling fan, and let it rain down shreds of grey-white newsprint snow upon me as I planned my next move.</p><p>I’d need a team. Not just any team would do. I needed the <i>best</i> of the <i>best</i> of the people I could find around my local car club. They, too, saw the appeal in risking their lives to secure free cars under maritime law. Our next step was the local air force base, to ask if we could borrow one of their helicopters.</p><p>Turned out it wasn’t very difficult - they leave the keys in those things, can you believe it? I had initially assumed that flying an Apache helicopter would be similar to driving a GMC Apache but it turns out that I was entirely wrong. Except for the occasional angry bark across the radio to keep us company, we were alone as we drifted out over the ocean to seek our prize.</p><p>Soon enough, we came upon it. When the company went out of business, they just dropped anchor and parked the bitch right in the middle of the ocean. Already, I imagined the undented hoods of free new cars gleaming in the morning sunrise, and involuntarily began to drool with desire.</p><p>There were some difficulties with the remaining crew, but when presented with a choice between letting us have their cars and getting beaten up for a company that couldn’t even give them their last paycheque, they relented, and we let them escape in our helicopter. We could just <i>drive</i> the ship back to port, I said to my peers. Maybe get rid of a few of the automatic transmissions below decks to pay for the dockage fees.</p><p>Finally, our prize was laid before us: row after row of new cars. Somehow it had been too easy. As I flicked on the light and saw what I had so heavily pirated, my heart sank.</p><p>We heard a thump from abovedecks, where we had posted a guard to keep watch, and then coarse, mocking laughter as the door to our tomb sealed behind us.<br/></p><p>“Enjoy your Murano Cross-Cabriolets, boys,” said the voice of Carlos Ghosn.<br/></p>

<p>As a hobbyist shareholder in the Volvo cars division, I was elated when I heard that it would finally be returning to Sweden. Which eccentric billionaire wanted to fund the development of further faux-luxury brickmobiles, I wondered. Later, it turned out that it was Ikea.</p><p>In the short term, it wasn’t bad at all. If I dinged a quarter panel, I could just spin off the internal-hex fasteners and swap it with another one from a vending machine. Its engine was made entirely out of sintered left-over allen keys, making the environmental impact almost nil. One day in spring, I discovered the terrible downside of the Volvo-Ikea VRUMVRUM.</p><p>The weather that day was not unusual for my sleepy mountain town: a spring shower followed by an immediate and drastic temperature rise to boiling-hot pavement. I came out of the grocery store to find my Volvo’s carbon fibre particleboard body panels delaminating, the entire car reduced to a set of very attractive seats sitting in a puddle of smouldering paper.</p><p>A wild-eyed Saab owner rolled slowly by, cackling with unhinged laughter through the open window before realizing he had used his irreplaceable power window switch, slightly limiting its lifespan.</p><p>It’s not so bad, though. The dealership had free meatballs, and hoarding cars in my garage was made much easier now that they could fit into stackable flat packs.</p>

<p>In my dreams, I fix endless fields of EJ22s.</p><p>Some would call it a curse, wrapping over from my day job into the abstract horrors of the Other Side. I just wish it would end. On each night - night after night after night - I replace leaking valve cover gaskets. My hands and arms are scraped, fingers worn raw to the bone. When it is complete, I restart the car.</p><p>The valve cover gaskets leak.</p><p>I tried to get to a psychic in the hope of regaining control over my fate. She turned me on to about three thousand bucks in assorted crystals and the secret of lucid dreaming. Finally, I thought, I would be able to summon up the right kind of RTV sealant to use to hold this valve cover in place.</p><p>That night, I wielded my newfound power over the Other Side’s ministrations, but it was all for naught. I looked up into the sky and saw it, an infinite geometric fractal, collapsing in on itself and being born anew, faster and faster, against a dead, starless sky stretching forever into the void.</p><p>Its hovering form shook with something that seemed - I shuddered at the concept of anthropomorphizing itself, to see my opponent as an intelligent lifeform - to be laughter. I can learn too, it said, and the field of EJ22s before me shifted.</p><p>I looked down into the dale of my nocturnal workshop and saw only fields of SR20DE-infused Sentras requiring new waterpumps.</p>

<p>At last, the recession had pushed the value of hangars at my local hobby airport below the point where I could afford them. Grinning, I signed the deal and high-fived my realtor, a man who would later be known to Fraud Investigators Quarterly magazine as “The Jaguar.”</p><p>Move-in day was uneventful; I had simply lashed up a tandem set of trailers behind the old turbodiesel Courier and hauled the least mobile of my project cars into the corner of the shop space, letting them take in their new lives as furniture. I heard a rapping at the door just as I finished slipping the last jacking plate from the wheels of the Matador.</p><p>One day and I was already meeting the neighbours? Some part of me knew what the problem would be before I could consciously realize or verbalize it, and I felt sweat creeping on the back of my hand as I gripped his in a brotherly handshake of we’re-the-good-guys-right?</p><p>“So, when are you moving your <i>plane</i> in?”<br/></p><p>I gulped. I don’t have a plane, I explained to him.</p><p>“Oh no, that won’t do. The condo bylaws say you have to use your hangar to store an airplane, or we have to evict you.” And then, conspiratorially: “we’re trying to keep the <i>gearheads</i> out.”<br/></p><p>Ha ha. Yes, the <i>gear</i>heads. Gotta keep them out. Once you let one in, that’s it, all these people using their vehicles for transportation instead of paying some other guy thousands to re-torque bolts every five minutes of operation.</p><p>“I’m just joking with you,” I explained as I made a beeline for the door, “my plane is coming on the next trailer. My&hellip; butler fucked up.”<br/></p><p>My companion smiled, waved as I departed the area. I was going to have to find a plane, and <i>fast</i>. But all my budget was used up on the hangar, and it was my understanding that planes were expensive. I made some phone calls.</p><p>That night, I unloaded my plane from the trunk of my Volare daily driver. My neighbour appeared again, looking confused at what I was unloading.</p><p>I gestured to the cube of steel, in the approximate vicinity of where the tail number probably ended up after it went through the FAA accident-investigation crusher. “It’s a <i>project</i> plane.”</p>

<p>When you drive a large boat, if even for a few days while you wait for the hardware store to bring in your drill bits and taps, people always want to talk to you about it. Maybe it’s because I took up four gas pumps or because I needed an entire wing of the parking lot to open my doors, but everyone seemed to take an interest in my ‘71 Lincoln Continental.</p><p>A trip to the mall resulted in so many questions that, by the time I had returned to my home several weeks later, the bank had foreclosed on the property they assumed to be abandoned. My shark of a lawyer would surely get my dragonesque hoard of spare parts back, I wasn’t worried about that, but I needed somewhere to sleep. My gaze eventually fell upon the Continental.</p><p>Several hours later, after the eBayed Apollo guidance computer and I had successfully managed to math out the combination of mooring procedures required to park the big-body Lincoln outside my local Princess Auto, I was ready to embark upon my project. The sun rose and fell and rose again, and at last it was complete.</p><p>A friend had heard about my dire straits, and pulled up in his Suzuki Sidekick, a car which seemed impossibly small now that I was used to the Lincoln. As he emerged from the pocket-dimension portals that lined either side of the small off-roader, I could already hear his condescending chuckling at me being forced to live out of the Continental.</p><p>I pushed a button, and the passenger side of the car extended several meters, with a fold-out living room sectional within. Naturally, I had opted for a chesterfield in period-correct tartan. My friend’s jeers had stopped, although admittedly it was difficult to hear him once I had descended the spiral staircase to the walk-out basement and fired up the grill on the back deck.</p>

<p>It’s great to be here. You’re a great audience, I can tell already. That lady over there, she’s <i>really</i> great. Call me.</p><p>What’s the <i>deal</i> with time?</p><p>Nobody seems to have enough of it. You ask a guy begging for change on the subway, he’ll be like “don’t have enough time to get a job.”</p><p>Well, you know when <i>I</i> don’t have enough time? The car wash. You put your little coins in (bloop bloop bloop) and they tell you “oh yeah, this is four minutes.”</p><p>It’s never four minutes. Come on, you’re not fooling anybody.</p><p>It’s like <i>two minutes</i>. If time actually passed as fast as they say it does, the instant I switch to the spot-free rinse my hair would turn white.</p><p>The worst part of it all is when you’re sitting in line behind someone using the foam brush, you know what I’m talking about. They’re all like SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE for maybe fifteen, twenty <i>minutes</i>, paint’s all coming off in spirals, while you’re sitting there gritting your teeth and waiting for them to drop dead.</p><p>I walk into the car wash office to complain about how short my wash is, the dude is sitting there at his desk. Behind him there’s a poster: TIME IS MONEY.</p>

<p>For contrived reasons, I was next in line to become the Pope. Long-time readers will remember that I was the Pope once before, and surely to become the Pope again would violate some kind of Catholic doctrine. To that I say: nope! Turns out nobody wrote down “can’t be the Pope twice.” Suckers.</p><p>I had to sit down in front of the existing Pope for a job interview. Awkward, right? As he explained it, he had not had a chance to read my resume before the interview, and so took a few minutes to look over it, noting that I had proficiency in Microsoft Word and clucking softly when he realized it was an outdated version. The Catholic Church might be draped in centuries-old tradition, he muttered under his breath, but it needed to keep up with the times.</p><p>Finally, it came time for the weeder questions, or so I thought. The Pope lowered the paper, looked me directly in the eyes, and asked me a question to test my moral fiber.</p><p>“Have you ever killed a tire for no reason?”<br/></p><p>My eyelid began to twitch involuntarily. The Pope no doubt noticed the beads of cold sweat settling into in my eyebrows as I vividly recollected destroying an entire tire-recycling dumpster in one furious March afternoon behind the abandoned Costco.</p><p>Thrown onto the wet cobblestones of Rome, I took one look backward at Vatican City and then thumbed the remote unlock fob in my pocket.</p><p>The Popemobile parked out front chirped happily.</p><p>My first boss had taught me a valuable lesson of business: never travel to do an interview without getting compensated.</p>

<p>A strange telegram appeared at my door one morning, delivered by a stranger who truly embodied the term. Mute, albino, and very, very tall, I tried my hardest to retreat into my shell of liberal-guilt-driven suburban acceptance as I took the note from him and read it. It seemed his vassal had requested my presence in order to help with his life’s work, and as I finished reading, the goon stepped aside and gestured to a waiting black car.</p><p>I looked at him, then at the car. My heart raced as I realized it was a long-wheelbase Toyota Century, no doubt imported at great effort. A <i>normal</i> man would have sent a new Audi, meant to impress the normals. This, I was coming to realize, would be a different job.</p><p>The trip took the better part of a day, weaving up into the mountains before we came across a beachfront estate, silhouetted against the setting sun. My chauffeur made himself scarce after collecting my bags from me, and I stepped into the lobby of the vacation home. Creaking gently as the house settled, the thick plaster walls held dozens of framed photographs, the glass smeared and obscured with atmospheric dust, collected over the years and never cleaned.</p><p>I was about to reach out with my hand, clear some of the grime from the pictures, when the goon reappeared. He passed me a note indicating that my work would be done in a separate wing from that of the proprietor, and that I must make no special effort to discover his identity. His privacy and seclusion was very important to him, and that I must not interfere as the work is completed.</p><p>He led me down a spiral staircase to a fantastic underground bunker, the walls studded with gleaming Snap-On toolchests. Against a far wall, I could see something shrouded by a dust cover. The fabric fought my attempts to identify the make and model at first, but I could tell that it was sharp, angular, and very practical.</p><p>When the cover came off, I realized why I had been chosen. A first-generation Subaru Liberty RS turbo wagon shuffled fist-sized chunks of rust onto the ground, its quarter panels nearly translucent with flaky metal cancer. In the hatch laid a close-ratio DCCD 6-speed.</p><p>As the weeks passed, I would eventually figure out the identity of my strange benefactor. I was sorely tempted to tell the goon, but somehow I felt that it would ruin some of the mystery. We rounded a corner, and from where I had come, I could hear the sound of peaky turbo burble echoing through the hills.</p><p>Although I had told no one, I made some strategic investments when I determined who the mystery man was. As the Japanese press went nuts at the reanimated cyborg body of Chikuhei Nakajima violently seizing control of Fuji Heavy, I called in my bets around the Tokyo Stock Exchange in my quest to have that most holy of holies, a non-rusty 2.5RS coupe.</p>

<p>When other people tell you they’re doing an engine swap on their Honda Civic, it’s like me telling you that I’m pulling out the pancake from my newly-purchased Subaru for a hot dose of sweet, sweet MLS head gaskets. It’s just what you do. There’s nothing unconventional about it.</p><p>I saw this Civic lying beneath a flickering streetlamp in the snow, a long-abandoned “FOR SALE” sign in the window. It wanted a new owner, someone who would take care of it. Its hail-dented fender accepted my touch readily, and I could sense through some as-yet-unexplained force that the car needed me as much as I needed it. All the metrics were checking out: this was A Good Car.</p><p>Weeks later, in the garage, I was preparing myself to chop out the rusty quarter panels and dose it up with a thick schmear of Bondo, fiberglass mesh, and crossed fingers. It’d worked before, but as the sawzall kicked its way up the B-pillar I found myself seized by a compulsion such that I could not stop the blade.</p><p>The thing with good cars is that if you cut them in half, they don’t become <i>two</i> good cars. That’s just a myth, spread by Big Sawzall Blade and the Home Depot Do-It-Yourself Illuminati. Even though the math doesn’t come out to a full integer multiple, what they <i>do</i> become is still more than the sum of their parts. So it was with this one.</p><p>With all this access, the logical next thing to do was an engine swap. I drove to the junkyard in search of a laundry list of items, and spotted a pitiful single-cam engine sitting in the corner of the returns pile. Thought it was a better engine than it was, the old grizzled junkyard manager explained to me. Someone should give it A Good Home. I asked him if agreeing to take it would mean I’d get a wheelbarrow to use this time.</p><p>When the welding was done, I had something very special indeed. If you were blind and also deaf, there is no way you could tell this car had been changed. That is, I guess, unless you were to touch or smell it or get close to it and felt the electric sensation of primal fear, spurred on by genetic memory, lift the hairs on the back of your neck heavenward.</p><p>If you sat in the seat, felt your way around the interior, the first thing you would notice are the twin gear shifters. It had been very difficult to mirror the five-speed linkage pattern such that it would drive the rear transmission in the correct pattern, but smarter men than I had been recruited, plied unwillingly with threats regarding the safety of their families, and had mostly delivered.</p><p>Day broke over the morning Honda meet, assorted resto-modded 80s/90s Civics and Integras gleaming in the sunlight. It was a magic moment, up until I showed up, fully sideways.</p><p>I kicked the front clutch pedal, momentarily cutting out the drive-by-wire throttle on the forward engine. The Civic yawed sideways, smoking the rear tires. As it came around, I switched clutches with a left-handed heel-toe and clicked the rear transmission down two gears. This continued for some time as I worked the twin sticks like an old-timey trucker, regulating the torque split throughout the savage donut - who needs DCCD? - and finished the ordeal by lighting up both ends of the car simultaneously, resulting in the world’s first - and only - two wheel drive Honda burnout.</p><p>The crowd was awestruck, staring at the twin rubber marks on the road, then burst into uproarious applause. I had done it - fulfilled the prophecy - and I had embarked upon the hero’s journey of legend spoken of in the Factory Service Manuals.</p><p>Years later, from my comfortable perch as CEO of the American Honda Motor Company, I would reflect on this moment as the point everything began to go wrong.</p>

<p>Toyota’s flame burned ever brighter in my peripheral vision. As yet another wave of 90s nostalgia crested over me, I found myself completely unable to resist the allure of their ovoid prize. I speak, of course, of the Toyota Previa, a people mover worthy of a king.</p><p>On paper, the Previa is sensual: available all-wheel drive or <i>factory supercharging in a family minivan</i>, a Sophie’s choice right out of the box. Mid-engined. Rear wheel drive. Vaguely egg-like. A cornucopia of 90s JDM goodies only a massively inflated shipping cost away. I decided it would be best to meet my heroes.</p><p>When it was offered to me, I shook the seller’s hand so firmly that it turns out I dislocated his shoulder and tore two major tendons. The screams were quickly drowned out as the throaty two-four roared to life beneath my feet and I departed from their suburban enclave.</p><p>Within weeks, the Previa was unrecognizable. Its once-mighty supercharger now received a heaping helping of air from the remote-mount turbo which replaced the rusted OEM mufflers, filling in the torque gap. If only Toyota had made this from the factory, I thought while merging into traffic at the approximate ground speed of a Saturn V on PCP, they would have put that pesky Dodge underwater for good.</p><p>Alas, every good project car must come to an end, and for me the Previa Madness came to its conclusion when, during a grocery expedition, I was offered actual money for it from a family of recent immigrants who wanted an unassuming seven-seater people mover with that oh-so-reliable Toyota marque on the hood.</p><p>The deal was signed on the spot, and there will always be a warm feeling in my heart when I think of my helping of the less mechanically able. Specifically, I will always remember the terrified look on the father’s face as the Precision 6062, spurred on by the wheezy Toyota blower, ramped up to full boost within the span of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Between high school and university, I worked in a we-pull-it junkyard for a few months. There was a nice dude who ran the place, Arnold. He liked cars, I think, because it would be impossible to have that job if you didn’t. Car <i>culture</i> was a whole other thing, perhaps.</p><p>Everyone at the yard noticed it. When we would haul in an old Datsun, Arnold would look at it before it went up on the forklift. There was a haunted look on his face, one that I would never see for any other make. It was like he was fighting an old war all over again.</p><p>One night, after work, we went to the nearby bar for a celebration. I forget why we were celebrating: I think maybe it was something to do with the hundred thousandth carload of metal shipped to the recycler’s, but it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that I got a little tooled-up, and with the alky-burning confidence of an newbie boozehound, asked Arnold what it was with Datsuns.</p><p>He looked at me, fixated my gaze with sad eyes, and let out a sigh that could crush a coconut.</p><p>“Every single one of these cars is nicer than the shell I’ve been welding up at home,” he moaned.</p>

<p>The truth was like an ochre tachometer needle through my brain. Highway runoff markers floated in the air, blurring as they passed beyond my front fenders. The repetitious act of Scandinavian flicks, the rear end slowing down to tap the front end in like a well-aimed putt. The paranoid feeling of an insistent overspeed buzzer. I was in a 1987 Toyota Corolla GT-S. Funny as hell, it was the worst used car purchase I could think of.<br/></p>

<p>Spica, the true name of the beast, dogged me forever, or at least for a week. Although the Alfetta told me such glorious tales of the Other Side of 7000 RPM, expressed in interpretive dance and song as its glorious cam pushed singing hellfire through its bores, I knew that it could not last.</p><p>I had awoken in a cold sweat the previous night, imagining from the dead of sleep that I could hear the rocker panels of the Alfetta rusting. The Alfa had pried open the eyelids of the Other Side, and now I could see it staring within me whenever my own eyelids were shut. There was plenty of time for rationalization and self-flagellation, but only after I found myself in the garage at four in the morning, investigating the rocker panel for the rust I was sure had been created by my languid psychic horror.</p><p>Perhaps I was too neurotic, or simply too cheap, to own such a jewel. I would have to move it onward. The listing was made, buyers were consulted, a deal was struck.</p><p>Here, as before, the Alfa had cast its dark magic: somehow I had owned an Alfa, beaten the shit out of it, and turned a <i>profit</i>. I imagined myself as a warrior, posed against the horrors of Spica, forced to fight for what was right in the world. When it was all done, I found myself to only be an enabler, a prophet of the ways of Spica. I had become the Previous Owner.</p><p>To repent for my sins, there was nothing else to do but punish myself. Years later, at Pebble Beach, the head judge asked me what my inspiration was. I had constructed a concours-correct, frame-up restoration of an Alfa Romeo 33 Sportwagon, possibly the only one in existence.</p><p>I looked at the judge, beaming in his featured-marque clothes dyed thick with Rosso corsa, and lowered my sunglasses so that he could see deep into my soul. He shook as he witnessed the Other Side in me. Perhaps he had escaped - lucky enough to be a voyeur - but now he stood before a true traveler. He agreed instantly that I deserved the medal, stumbling over his own words as he stepped backwards, brushing against a gleaming silver Maserati as he departed in fear. 

</p><p>Later, in <i>sotto voce</i>, he conspiratorially told me that he knew no physical trinket could restore what I had lost, but that he had an idea, and slipped a business card into my hand.</p><p>I looked at the business card when I sat down in the passenger seat of the tow truck. On it was the name and number of an Alfa collector, with “HE HIDES THEM AWAY” written on the card in the judge’s loose ballpoint-pen cursive.</p>

<p>Have you ever known fear? For one all-too-short week in September, fear and I got real close - hot and heavy, I’m telling you. It prickled itself up my fingers, raced along the nerves and tendons of my wrists, and wrapped its claws around my flagellating heart.<br/></p><p>The name of that fear was 1976 Alfa Romeo Alfetta, and within that fear laid another, more arcane terror, stacked inside it like a carved-brimstone nesting doll from the waiting room of Hell itself: the Spica fuel injection system. At least the colour was right, I thought as I slotted the delicate gear stalk into place, somehow avoiding angering the third gear synchronizer further.</p><p>Being afraid of the Spica system wasn’t an odd or obsessive fear: it dogged me every moment of my ownership, the spectre of fuelling system failure hanging over me like a dark shroud, as certain as death itself. Would this be the day it finally let go, leaning out catastrophically mid-corner in a glorious shower of rod components and tinkling aluminum? No, I thought: it would wait until I was at ease, pulling into a parking lot of a Walmart, refusing to treat the car’s exotic heart with the respect it deserved. One moment I would be cross-checking my three o’clock for stray shopping carts, and then I would be picking razor-sharp chunks of crankshaft out of my oil-soaked front tires.</p><p>In the end, the seller had gotten what he wanted from me: he had laid a trap so devious that at first I assumed it to be intentional. He smirked as he led me to the backyard garage, telling me there was something really special. His grin only got wider as he laid out the package deal: if I took his almost-mint condition, runs-sometimes Land Rover IIa as part of the deal, he would give me a discount. He would make me - and he paused for emphasis as my heart dropped into my stomach - <i>a good deal</i>.</p><p>It was rare for a seller to know the core of my being, my true heart, and I found myself powerless before his machinations. In my weakness I retreated within myself, where I could observe my hands palming out stacks of fifties, my conscious mind unable to put a halt to the proceedings, to flee backwards from this dark alley into the warm light of reasonable economy cars.</p><p>I knew I would curse his name soon, and not just as I shuffled my harem of vehicles in and out of my unassuming suburban garage.</p>

<p>When you spend as much time on Kijiji and Craigslist as I do, you build up strange layers of some sort of innate resistance to temptation. It’s very easy to see a car of your dreams and then turn it down because of an imagined laundry list of issues produced by the demonized Previous Owner. Just when I thought that I was out of the woods, though, a 1976 Alfa Romeo Alfetta with Frenched foglights appeared in my nearby-sales RSS feed. My forehead beaded with sweat. My pupils dilated. I felt a primal fear that my ancestors must have prepared for me centuries ago, and found myself unable to catch my breath.</p><p>The problem is that I could not trust myself to resist an Alfa. How could I, with such unique features as red paint and a largely questionable fuel-injection system? The only thing to do, I felt, was to lock myself away in the special padded room I had constructed in my basement for just such an occasion.<br/></p><p>My wife yelled after me as I descended the stairs, but I was unable to hear her words. The keypad beeped happily as it accepted my entry, and the thick steel vault door shut behind me.</p><p>As I sat on the floor of the vault, trying to cold-turkey the Alfa lust out of my system, I realized three things: first, that I forgot to put lights in this vault, second, that I forgot to test the oxygen supply, and third that my wife did not have the access code with which to bring me food while I tried to wait out the two-month expiry date on the Kijiji ad.</p><p>To this very day I cannot tell you how long I was down there. In solitary, days turn into weeks turn into months turn into years seamlessly. If you asked my wife, it was a matter of only a few minutes before I realized that I could just take the screws off the vault-door hinges from within, and used the always-present JIS screwdriver collection from my pocket to take those hinges off.</p><p>I was free: but what is freedom when you own a ‘76 Alfetta with a high-lift cam? As the little engine raced to redline, breaking up only temporarily as the distributor freaked out at the concept of atmospheric moisture, I knew that I had traded one dark solitary-confinement vault for another. This one, I began to realize with a creeping fear, held no JIS screws.</p>

<H1>Sweet Chili Heat and the Nextdoor Probably-Racists</H1>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a little Mazda named Sweet Chili Heat. Sweet Chili Heat and his owner lived in an unassuming suburb, where they would happily do basic maintenance and the occasional grocery run.</p><p>In that suburb, there was a social network named Nextdoor, where Sweet Chili Heat’s neighbours would discuss the abstract concepts of crime and punishment in a twenty-first century left adrift by the destruction of trusted institutions in a sea of rapidly accelerating technological and social changes. Sometimes people would complain about Sweet Chili Heat, but Sweet Chili Heat never saw that, because he was a car and did not know how to get on the Internet.</p><p>One day, Sweet Chili Heat’s owner accidentally enabled the text-to-speech functionality of his overcomplicated and often-confusing smartphone. Before he could shut it off, Sweet Chili Heat heard the entire rant about the “super loud car driven by that Mexican menacing the security of the existence of our people and a future for white children.”</p><p>Well, let me tell you, Sweet Chili Heat did not take kindly to racism. Maybe it was because of his birth in Hiroshima, where he saw the futility of man’s hatred towards his fellow man, or maybe it was because he jealously desired the secret of rational thought and despised those who would throw it away for lazy stereotyping.</p><p>The next morning, Sweet Chili Heat awoke. In the night, his slow but capable cruise-control ECU (for Sweet Chili Heat was carbureted, unlike his smarter and younger brother who resided in the same garage) had done enough lexical and semantic analysis to figure out the most likely source of the slurs.</p><p>When the police arrived, they found a family, all clutching their individual copies of <i>Mein Kampf</i>. At first, they could not determine the cause of death. Upon further investigation, the coroners discovered all the members of the family were missing their auditory cortexes. In their place was nothing but sparkling goo, as if they had been pummeled into liquid by some unknown force.</p><p>Nobody suspected Sweet Chili Heat after the muffler was re-attached.</p>

im permabanned poster ej25popper58. i first started reading the subaru flannel thread when i was about 12. by 14 i got really obsessed with the concept of &ldquo;divergent mechanical engineering&rdquo; and tried to channel it constantly, until my thought process got really bizarre and i would repeat things like &ldquo;integrated front differential&rdquo; and &ldquo;two piece shortblocks&rdquo; in my head for hours, and i would get really paranoid, start seeing things in the corners of my eyes etc, basically prodromal schizophrenia. im now on antipsychotics. i always wondered what the kind of “doing maintenance&quot; style of subaru ownership was all about; i think it&rsquo;s the unconscious leaking in to the conscious, what jungian theory considered to be the cause of schizophrenic and schizotypal syptoms. i would advise all people who &ldquo;own&rdquo; multiple subarus to be careful because that likely means you have a predisposition to a mental illness. peace.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Some people can be very rude. For instance, the Ferrari factory started locking their scraps bin after they caught me in there trying to make off with a scratch-and-dent flat-plane V8 crankshaft. After interrogating me for a bit, they determined that I was not in fact some kind of industrial spy but instead something much more menacing.</p><p>Enzo’s goon took his eyes off me just long enough to re-wrap his blood-stained hands, and I used that split second to the utmost. A series of expensive-looking kung fu moves left him unconscious, the chair he tied me to shattered over his head. On the way out, I visited the locker room and picked up a factory uniform in just my size.</p><p>Now normally, I would never deign to put a <i>new</i> part into a car I’m building - they’re usually just not as good as the original parts - but seeing as I was actually in the factory I figured I could do my own QC and make sure I got the pick of the litter.</p><p>With a clipboard in hand and a stern expression on my face, nobody would dare question me, even as I unloaded 488 engines by the pallet into the back of a breadvan-conversion Punto Abarth. As I blew out of the Ferrari forecourt, the rear suspension squeaking and groaning under the strain of Maranello’s finest, I glimpsed back at the factory and smiled.</p><p>When the carabinieri finally came looking for me at Switch Villa, they found no trace of the stolen Ferrari engines. The senior inspector had poked through every closet, took delicate notes on every piece of parts I had lying around (saving me the trouble of filling out a spreadsheet, so it was a net positive, really) and then interrogated me again and again. At last, and with the aid of my good friend handful-of-small-denomination-Euros, they had to let me go.</p><p>Where the inspector had failed to look, of course, was the engine bays of the Maserati BiTurbos that clogged my back yard. I was determined to have reliable Italian twin-turbo boost, even if it killed me.</p>

<p>The key to having a lot of beaters is really liquidity. It’s not just some fancy word that your financial advisor throws around to explain why all of your money disappeared up his nose. Oh no. Think of liquidity like the grease in a wheel bearing. If it’s shitty assembly grease that bearing is going to eat itself within weeks. If you take that bearing apart, and pack it with the really nice sticky red stuff that gets stuck on your drywall when you inevitably drop the fucker on the garage floor, oh boy, now we’re talking.</p><p>Where was I again? Bearings? Oh, no, liquidity.</p><p>Like I said, the key thing at any time is to be able to move out on a beater within seconds of spotting a better one. I was sitting on a needed-almost-nothing (by my standards) Alfa Romeo Spider when an International Scout II showed up within taxi distance to my house. Perfect score, right? But he didn’t want to trade. This created a difficulty, as I needed to (at the very least) move a ton of Italian steel out of my driveway before the insurance man caught on to just how many aliases I’ve been giving him. Repeat after me: <i>Ese no es mi Alfa, eso es el señor de Flippo.</i> I think he bought it.</p><p>So therein lay the problem: my Alfa was <i>illiquid</i>. It wasn’t really a solid either, more like a collection of rust powder loosely held together by poor-quality paint. In order to move this Alfa, I was going to need to take a bit of a haircut.</p><p>One trip to the junkyard later, and I had slapped a Honda Accord Coupe badge on the back and posted an only slightly deceptive ad on Craigslist. It moved instantly, a buyer coming up from another town thinking he was getting an efficient, reliable Japanese product for his money.</p><p>When I returned to the house of the Scout II, cash in hand, I found that the previous owner had already sold it to someone just before I got there. Another kind of liquidity is bleeding a man slowly into a transmission drain pan after lashing him to an engine stand with rusty hose clamps.</p>

<p>Maybe it was my general opposition to the supernatural, or perhaps he hadn’t really appreciated it that I had shaken his lamp in an industrial paint-mixing tumbler, but either way the genie was pissed.</p><p>“I GIVE YOU THE CURSE OF PASSIVE BOLT-LOOSENING,” he boomed, “FOREVERMORE WILL BOLTS BE SLIGHTLY LOOSENED AROUND YOU WITHOUT LIFTING A FINGER.”<br/></p><p>I tried to stifle laughter. For an ordinary man I’m sure this would have been a problem. For me, this curse was more of a, how do you say, blessing? After the first few weeks of bringing Loctite to work to keep my standing desk from collapsing on me, I was chuckling my way through fix-and-flips at a rate my friends found incredible. They were a little confused initially when I told them they had to park at least four blocks away, but after empirically determining the radius of effect of my so-called curse, it was really the safest thing for them.</p><p>One morning, I received a telegram. I could watch the UPS truck rapidly disassemble as it idled in front of my house, the deliveryman feeling the strain of waiting for a tip and signature even as he watched his work vehicle reduced to a loose pile of its constituent components. A sea of fasteners rolled out from the panels, down the hill outside my house, and into the storm drain at the end of the street, a beautiful shimmering wave of tinkling.</p><p>The telegram said that a favourite aunt had taken ill and I must immediately visit her far away. I immediately summoned a taxi, then another taxi a few minutes later, then you get the idea. Leaving behind me a trail of dismantled Camry Hybrid unibodies, I entered the (thankfully welded-together) joints of the airport departures terminal.</p><p>I stayed on that tarmac for what felt like eternity, waiting for the maintenance crew to complete bolt-torque cross-check. From somewhere far away, I swore I could faintly hear the laughter of the genie.</p>

<p>The Trans Mountain road rally changed something deep inside me. An ordinary commute didn&rsquo;t move the needle anymore. I needed adventure, risk, hubris, delight. What I needed was a <i>worse car</i>. In the consignment lot of the once-Mitsubishi dealer, I found what my heart had been looking for all this time.<br/></p><p>My loved ones were concerned, of course: they sent me for a battery of tests, both psychological and physiological. On impact-typed letterhead bearing the name of a dead doctor, I released my own medical findings to the press, confirming that I was hale and hearty, the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency of owning a Chrysler Intrepid.</p><p>The first few weeks were a resounding disappointment: the orgy of squirrel-eaten wiring and loosely-tensioned accessory belts that made up my new daily driver somehow managed to form an odd kind of “reliability.” If I wanted to climb the mountain of busted-on-the-roadside-quick-repair-it enlightenment, things were going to have to get a whole lot less reliable in a hurry.</p><p>At last, a crank bearing let go. From somewhere deep within the bowels of the three-three V6, a crude shattering echoed upwards through the bores and out from the headers as the shortblock was incrementally reduced to scrap steel diarrhea at escape velocity. I expertly piloted my Hindenburging land yacht to the roadside and climbed out, beaming at the <i>normals</i> who dared to finish their commutes in practical yet risk-free vehicles.</p><p>Perhaps I hadn’t thought my plan out all the way, I realized, as I tried to remember how to walk long distances. After a few false starts, I climbed out of the ditch into which I had fallen and consulted the Intrepid. A steaming mess of exploded car blood and shattered internals stared back at me when I popped the hood, and I felt the rising tide of panic in my throat.</p><p>I fought that panic. I was no ordinary man, and giving up at this juncture would abandon everything I had worked for. The possibly-imaginary <i>culture</i> that sprung up around three hundred dollar megabeaters would look down upon me in disdain and crucify me on a fixture made entirely of junkyard-reject Chrysler ten-bolts. Like it or not, I was going to have to fix this car with stuff I found on the roadside.</p><p>Now confident in my ability to walk short distances, I did so, and came back with quite the prize. It turned out there was a daycare down the road with a particularly inattentive babysitter.</p><p>Kids will believe anything you tell them, especially if you tell them you’re Santa and need replacement motive power for your sleigh. The eight-year-old I had appointed to the rarefied position of “Rudolph” was probably making more horsepower than the old pushrod sixer ever could have hoped for.</p>

<p>I think everyone has had this experience before: you walk through the wrong door at the audition, and end up getting tapped to be the head writer for a new Broadway play about the internal combustion engine. Despite what the corporate doctors had said during my pre-hiring physical, I was up for a challenge.</p><p>What I found out was that there’s a huge gap between writing something and making it happen on the stage. Before long, I was also directing the play, screaming stage directions from a booming PA system powered by a big-block Mopar. My actors, generally of a sensitive type, didn’t really appreciate my profane back-of-shop mannerisms and random physical assaults. So they quit too.</p><p>In the end, my one-man show about the internal combustion engine was a resounding success. The New York Times theatre reviewer didn’t bother showing up to it before writing the review, and a well-placed press release before his deadline made sure that I would have suckers - er, patrons - forevermore! No refunds, assholes.</p><p>On the Today show the next day, my coronation was brisk but respectful. They asked me what the most challenging role was. I told them it was my big solo piece about piston rings, <i>Grab That Flame Front</i>, set to the tune of <i>Tiptoe Through The Tulips</i>.</p>

<p>The village elders circled me warily from a safe distance. My guide, confused, translated. “They say your arrival has been foretold. You are&hellip; The Man Who Killed A Toyota?” His voice was peaking with terror. He had been away from the village for too long as he sought his fortune, and he was just now realizing his mother’s warnings about the outside world had come true.</p><p>“No,” I said to him, hands outstretched in a gesture of open communication. “I am the man who killed a <i>Hilux</i>.”</p><p>I crossed the floor then, the elders making a path for me as they attempted to maintain minimum safe distance. My fingers grasped the Crystal Valve Cover upon its marble plinth and I swept it into my toolbag.</p><p>My guide could take the strain no longer. A fight between us ensued, one that I easily won, although not without ripping my shirt and exposing the torque specs tattooed across my upper body. I hope he didn’t expect a good tip for that kind of service.</p><p>The eldest of the village elders began to bellow something, a curse of some kind, before coughing and switching to English.</p><p>“I hope you got a Lincoln Navigator for a rental, you motherfucker,” he yelled as I passed through the exit of the temple.<br/></p>

Do you like the Mk2 GTI 16v?<br/><br/>Their early work was a little too playful for my tastes, but when the Mk2 GTI came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and dynamically. The whole chassis has a crisp, springy feel, and a new raspy exhaust on the eight-valve that really announces the car has arrived. They&rsquo;ve been compared to Audi, but I think Volkswagen has a far more acute sense of swaybar tuning.<br/><br/>In &lsquo;87, Volkswagen released this, the 16 valve 1.8, their most accomplished motor. I think their undisputed masterpiece is the thermostat housing, a design so convoluted most German mechanics never pay attention to it. But they <i>should</i>, because it&rsquo;s not just about avoiding an exploding heater core or inconvenient block rupture, it&rsquo;s also important to maintain cooling system pressure in the questionable water jacket design.<br/></p>

<p>Once again, the Ford Motor Company thought that they had me over a barrel. That’s the thing about barrels, though - Donkey Kong throws them at you. While you wrestle with that metaphor, I’ve opened the hood of the Aspire and are showing you the goods.</p><p>What everyone needs to know about the Festiva and Aspire is that they were unfortunate little cars, born under the hateful visage of people who <i>hated subcompacts</i>. Can you even believe such a person exists? Subcompacts are the adorable puppies of the car world, mincing and dancing around the ankles of their larger compatriots. Ford management, though, whooo, they’d apparently kick that puppy directly into a wall for daring to threaten their profit margins.</p><p>If there was one thing I was put on Earth to do, said the disembodied voice only I can hear that greets me every morning, it was to make the Ford Aspire appreciated by the public. At first I believed the path to redemption for the little KiaMazdaFord laid in forced induction, a mystical gift delivered from On High that let us recycle worthless exhaust into more glorious torque.</p><p>I was wrong! I was so wrong! The realization that my life had been for naught hit me like a ton of bricks, leaving me reeling and depressed for years. At first, I found comfort in alcohol, but even that lapsed when I realized people at car shows just weren’t impressed by a one-liter beater shooting invisible streaks of nitromethane fire into the raffle booth.</p><p>Perhaps religion held the answer, I imagined, picking up a book I believed to be like the factory service manual for the soul. I was wrong again: instead, it appeared to be like a <i>Haynes</i> manual for the soul. After throwing it away in disgust I found myself consumed by Eastern meditation, in hopes of convincing my racing mind to settle for a rough big-cam idle.</p><p>Like the Tao says, there was a Third Way. I would blend the best of the Ford school of thought with the best of the Mazda belief structure. Only in this way would the schism innate to the Ford Aspire at last be resolved, bringing respect to the model and intellectual honesty to the domestic subcompact market.</p><p>The sun breaks over the opened hood of the Aspire, blinding you temporarily so only the contrasting insectoid contours of the engine transplant are at first visible. It doesn’t take a geometry professor to figure out how many intake runners there are on this baby, and as your jaw drops, preparing to stammer out a question, I smile.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to jam a supercharged five-liter Coyote under the hood of a 1995 Ford Aspire, but dammit, I found a way.</p>

<p>The worst part about breaking a Honda isn’t the fact that your car is no longer functional. Oh no, it’s all the stuff that comes after.</p><p>I had barely had a chance to return my phone to my pocket after calling the tow truck when I got another call. I knew what it was, sure. On the line was Honda customer support.</p><p>“We heard your 24-year-old Honda Civic recently couldn’t start because of a material defect in our engineering. Is this true?”<br/></p><p>“Uh, yes, but it’s really due to my negligence in mainten-”<br/></p><p>The line went dead. I sighed, knowing what would come next.</p><p>As the sun hesitantly rose over my house the next morning, I heard an insistent (but very polite) rapping of knuckles on my front door. Grumbling, I descended the stairs in my nightgown to answer the door.</p><p>“Hello, honoured customer,” said the interpreter, smiling in embarrassment. “This man is our executive in charge of customer service. He has worked at Honda for seventeen years and he wishes to announce his great displeasure at your unprecedented mechanical failure. He will now take his own life to restore your confidence in the many products of the Honda Motor Corporation. Please sign here to acknowledge the seppuku has been delivered.”<br/></p><p>I rolled my eyes. Without saying a word, I strode the distance of my lawn and yanked the tanto from the hand of the jetlagged executive before he could plunge it into his abdominal wall.</p><p>“What’s his name?” I barked at the interpreter.<br/></p><p>“You have greatly offended Taro-san by rejecting his offer of ritual suicide!” he shrieked, while busily removing alternate bladed weapons from the trunk of the fleet-plated Pilot they had arrived in.<br/></p><p>“Taro,” I said, looking into the executive’s eyes, “it’s okay that a 24 year old car had a small electrical failure due to a lack of maintenance. Come with me. We will get you installed into a nice American corporation where nobody tries very hard and failure is rewarded with thick executive bonuses.”<br/></p><p>Even though I knew he could not understand my words, I noticed a softening in his eyes as he allowed me to take him by the hand. Together, we drove to a nearby Silicon Valley dot-com where I released him into the boardroom. I looked on as he first hesitantly sniffed, then frolicked with the other executives, free at last from the harsh penalties for corporate malfeasance in his home country.</p><p>As I returned home, I remembered that I should have asked him for a discount on a new main relay. That shit costs two hundred bucks from the dealer, I yelled at myself as I smacked my own forehead.</p>

<p>I’m a traditionalist at heart. When you show me fancy new gadgets, the thing I think of first is how I can subvert them to make my will dominant upon them. Does this ethos extend to sentient life forms? You bet your sweet little bippy it does.</p><p>Everything started, as these sort of things do, with cheap deals on parts. Some MIT egghead had figured out how to shrink an entire lidar setup onto a single chip and sell it for ten bucks. For my part, I had figured out how to buy the Chinese knockoff of that same chip on eBay for thirty-nine cents. Capitalism made my head spin sometimes, but not as much as what came next.</p><p>After a weekend of thrashing a perl script together, I had what I felt was a pretty decent self-driving car firmware. When it came time to render one of my cars self-driving, what better to choose than one that was mostly inert in a corner of my garage? Sweet Chili Heat had sat in my storage, dead, awaiting a drivers’ seat, fresh plugs, a quick Seafoaming, tie rod ends, windshield wiper blades, new exhaust gaskets, front cover gaskets and maybe an AC recharge.</p><p>I strapped a few dozen bucks of lidar to the edges of the car, ran a thick copse of wiring throughout the rust holes in the body, and plugged it into an old Eee PC I found in the kitchen junk drawer. My latest creation was done, and I flipped the switch. Nothing happened. I checked the battery - a reasonable voltage was emitted - and bonked the starter, and still nothing.</p><p>Frustrated, I retired to my parts-filled kitchen, preparing a Hot Pocket. I had always admired the malaise-era Formica that dominated the room, and in fact I was studying it when I heard a bang and a furious roar. A furious roar, in fact, not unlike a 12A awakening from ancient torpor.</p><p>I ran out to the garage to find the door in ruins, reduced to matchsticks. Sweet Chili Heat was nowhere to be seen. For hours afterward, I scanned the neighbourhood for signs of my stolen RX-7, believing it to be in the possession of a thief with greater mechanical skills than I, a thief who could revive dead cars. That’d be some creepy shit, I thought, as I returned home, depressed.</p><p>“Wait, I thought you were at the Safeway,” my terrified roommate said, eyes wide with fright. He was watching the news, and soon so was I.<br/></p><p>Sweet Chili Heat was unmistakable, even from a choppy news-helicopter camera image, as it ripped savage burnouts around the cart corral, menacing any and all nearby piston-powered Mazdas for their betrayal. I turned off the television as it caved in the rear quarter panel of a 4x4 MPV, unwilling to witness further carnage from my sweet little Dorito machine.</p><p>A few weeks later, I received a letter in the mail from the police. It seemed that my RX7 had gotten picked up after robbing a Walmart for the last of their 13-inch GTRadials. After the cops, correctly identifying a sentient RX7 as an ethnic minority, had chased it into a ditch, Sweet Chili Heat demanded to speak to its lawyer. That lawyer, naturally, called for a character witness, who was me.</p><p>Things didn’t really get out of hand until the Netflix camera crew showed up and placed my testimony under copyright. You can see what happened next on the twelve-part documentary, <i>To Catch An Epitrochoid</i>, this fall.</p>

<p>I was a businessman. More importantly, I was a <i>new media entrepreneur</i>. When you look at the cover of Fast Company or Yacht Fetishists Monthly, you see a person like me, decked out in gaudy gold jewelry and purple-pinstriped suits that looked like they mugged one of the Brooks Brothers. My medium was television, and my fiefdom was the top of the Nielsen ratings for reality programming.</p><p>When the network first came to my attention, they did so by going through a trusted confidante. To hear him tell it, he was halfway through pulling the propane tanks off the back of an unattended taco truck when some corporate executives showed up. Unable to fight them off, he was held down and forced to listen to their notes. The force of their will turned his hair permanently white, and he would talk with a stutter forevermore, except when dealing in business.</p><p>He returned to the ranch, where many of us were working on cars that cost less than the average two-martini lunch in Hollywood. It wouldn’t have seemed natural that we would be such a fit, but that’s the thing about ‘fit:’ you just need to do a little clearancing. Often with an angle grinder.</p><p>Once we had finished taking that angle grinder to the collective and individual faces of various television executives and financiers, we had our show. Every week, you would see the crew work on some dramatically-overblown crisis project that needed to be done yesterday. The emotions, the pathos, the <i>bathos</i> - Gordinis aren’t the only kind of classics I studied, assholes - all of it added up to a melange of delight for our viewership.</p><p>Someone once said that pride comes before the fall, and they were probably right about that sort of thing. For me, the fall came during an ill-advised live taping of our show, where I dropped a bolt inside the engine bay and let loose a largely unbroken twenty-five-minute tirade of creative profanity, paused only by catching my breath and telling wildly-waving production assistants that I knew what I was doing.</p><p>We were off the air the next day. The lesson to take home from all this? America will tolerate the idea of work, but not the language.</p><p>As for me, I was stuck with retiring to my Beverly Hills mansion with attached 36-car garage. Indeed, I was doomed to forever live off the revenue I could make from copyright strikes against pirated YouTube uploads of my “career-ending” rant.</p>

<H1>He Say You Parts Runner</H1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen things you people wouldn&rsquo;t believe. Abandoned 12-bolts in ditches off the shoulder of the Ford bank. I watched entire D16Z6 heads glitter in the trunk of crushed Civics. All those parts will be sent to China, like scalded copper in Fort Mac homes. Time to lease.<br/></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why he saved my Protege. Maybe in those last moments he loved Mazdas more than he ever had before. Not just my Mazda - anyone&rsquo;s JDM; my FWD. All he&rsquo;d wanted were the same parts the rest of us want. CV shafts, close-ratio gearboxes, limited-slip differentials, boost gauges. All I could do was sit there and watch him have kids.</p>

<p>It may come as a surprise to both you and biologists that I have a cousin. He lives in California, and has a very popular Instagram full of gorgeous cars that he never has to wash. As you can assume, this is irritating to me.</p><p>Family reunions are hard, and they’re harder still when a large portion of the diaspora of the Switch family remains under FBI surveillance. Coordinating the prison breakouts, double-agent fakeouts and other miscellanea required to slip the dragnet is itself an undertaking that would cause even the hardiest of party planners to throw their hands up in disgust and reach for the .38 snubnose on the corner of their desk, a single expectant bullet chambered within.</p><p>I got carried away with that last one. Long story short, my cousin, Califonia Switch, was coming to visit. He wanted to spend some of that filthy rich USD on my depressed assets and maybe pick up a project car for his troubles (”I never fly anywhere without driving back,” he said, inadvertently explaining in a single sentence why he had never been outside of North America).</p><p>When I picked him up at the airport, he only wanted to know where all the cool old cars were. I was ready for him.</p><p>I asked him to hold out his hands, and then filled his palms from a bag of rust.</p><p>“That’s a numbers-matching 1980 El Camino,” I said, “don’t wash your hands.”</p>

<p>We were deep into the bowels of two-stroke madness, that special kind of mania you get on the tenth or fifteen pull of the ripcord. You can sense compression, but the iron triangle of internal combustion eludes you. Hysteria washes over you in an awful wave made of pinpricks and acid, and it’s on that last go-for-broke tug that It Happens.</p><p>Somewhere deep within a physics textbook, someone has probably written an equation for the magical sensation that a human being feels when a two-stroke learns to walk, its staggered strides giving way to smooth idle. You can read that equation, do a few curious variable substitutions, prod it, chart it, but you can never be both inside and outside the expansion chamber as I was in that moment.</p><p>My neighbours burst from their comfortable suburban lifestyles, clutching carriers full of beloved family pets. Seeing not an earthquake but instead my grease-stained countenance, their fear is resolved in an instant. A few of them stay behind in the street, pretending that they meant to barge out of their homes in their boxer shorts and wifebeaters. I may have chuckled, but it is difficult to say, the reverb of the bored-and-stroked thumper vibrating my ribcage like a strummed harp.</p><p>Beyond smug, I use this furious power - the might of a god - to cut my grass. At least the smoke keeps the mosquitoes down.</p>

<p>They told us they needed an espresso machine that could flood an entire Olympics with black joy, and they needed it yesterday. Whoever ‘they’ were, they definitely knew how to get my interest.</p><p>Once we had finished figuring out how to trick Mr. T onto the plane this week, we were jetting off to Rio. I had planned to take the occasion to do some shopping, but you can imagine my surprise when I learned the IL-76 we bought on eBay didn’t come with a Skymall catalogue.</p><p>As befit such an undertaking, I had naturally brought only the best of the best, and before the wheels could touch foreign soil we already had a plan of attack and a reasonable prototype. Just try claiming a GMC 4.3L V6 as carry-on luggage on any other airline. Even if you could get it through the little mild-steel suitcase sizer at the check-in desk, the overhead luggage bins are only rated for 275 lb max - when the statute of limitations expires, you can ask me how I know.</p><p>That first night was magical. Maybe it was the nitromethane fumes burning at my eyes as bank after bank of surplus vee-six monsters cackled at their peak RPM, or maybe it was the sunset falling over a beautiful ocean clogged only occasionally by couches and human feces.</p><p>We weren’t foolish enough to expect medals at the end. That said, we definitely expected better than being thrown in prison when we returned home.</p><p>It turns out the GMC 4.3L V6 was the key to America’s power all along, and exporting of it was subtly forbidden. What we had done was closer to “smuggling an entire IL-76 cargo hold full of contraband,” our lawyer told us.</p><p>My partner started to tell them that we had actually removed a ton of the plane’s superstructure to make room for more Vortecs, but I managed to kick him in the shins before he could finish. We definitely didn’t want the FAA on our case.</p><p>Our lawyer reminded us to keep quiet as an eyepatched man from the US government walked into the room. His scarred hands proffered a red folder marked “TORQUE UNIT.”</p><p>And they say the government isn’t a friend to small business.</p>

<p>The thing about doing spark-plug replacement on a Ford three-valve is, like a 180,000 mile plug, by the end of it you’re pretty burnt up.</p><p>I would never forget the men I followed into hell during my seven-year stint at Jefferson Brake and Muffler. It was my job, in fact.</p><p>Other shops would put names and years on a pretty plaque, memorialize the techs that had sacrificed their life for the cause. A little bit of fake Indian rosewood, some laser-embossed quartz, that’s what a man’s life was. That’s what a man’s story was.</p><p>There was a sense that each of these fallen techs were fading away, disappearing from our lives as easily as they had entered. This thought terrified the owner, already obsessed with his own mortality. As such, he brought me onboard, a sort of war photographer for the everyday battle that lived within a flat-rate tech’s mind and could only be glimpsed in white-hot streaks of pain by those who loved him.</p><p>I remember the first day of our friends-and-family summer barbeque. In apologia, the owners created a relaxing event where our techs could bring their oft-neglected family in an effort to increase their trust. Familial bonds were nothing, I remember thinking, in the face of the brothers-in-arms mentality that I witnessed every day beneath a two-post lift.</p><p>In my strange role, as the day proceeded I would find myself explaining to confused loved ones about why their breadwinners seemed so distant upon returning from work. It was the Tritons, I explained to one terrified small-business accountant as I plied her with exotic gins from the tailgate dispensary of my Meteor Ranch Wagon.</p><p>As the evening wore on, her young husband excitedly discussing camshaft profiles and exotic liquor with a coworker, she became further and further inebriated. At last, in a rush of words, she demanded to be shown the source of her family’s psychic pain.</p><p>There was one on the lift. There was always one on the lift.</p><p>It had the cab already removed. This would serve as a two-part lesson: first, the true underlying structure of the facade that allowed society to still consider the abomination as a single consistent entity, and second, the spark plug thing.</p><p>Her husband, feeling an empathetic terror in the gut of his stomach, barged into the shop, screamed, but it was too late.</p><p>She had broken a #8 plug off, and was herself sacrificed to the Triton V10.</p><p>I could hear the plug snap within the bores, a sound somehow so loud it would mute her husband’s screams of terror. His strenuous effort, his marital oath to protect her, was made void in an instant of negligence.</p><p>We hung two plaques that Friday evening. I remembered everything. It was my job.</p>

<p>Getting a job at the railway is surprisingly easy. I thought I might fail the driver’s test, but it just consisted of putting my car in first gear, driving forward, then stopping and reversing. They gave me an A-plus grade, they said, I was a natural.</p><p>If I was a natural, then that explained the angry looks from all of the highly trained (get it?) engineers at the break room on Monday morning. They were simply jealous. I tried to ignore their stares while I filled my novelty steam-locomotive mug and wiped my hands on my 1930s-era conductor uniform, complete with a cloth hat I had stolen from a child’s birthday party on the way here.</p><p>In orientation, there were more eyerolls when I tried to connect the discrete concepts of “trains” and “basic training,” a pun so blatant that you could use it instead of the horn when approaching crossings. Or so I thought, until I got that question on the post-orientation pop quiz wrong. Lot of tests in the railway, I’ll tell you that much.</p><p>That’s when I saw it. A hi-rail Unimog. It glistened in the sun, its corrosion-resistant DIN-compliant safety paint appearing to me as if a bumblebee from Hell itself. The Germans had really done it this time, let me tell you: a truck that could drive on a road, off a road, or <i>on a railroad</i>. If you were standing next to me, you would have heard a strange sucking sound as my mind expanded, flashes of new possibilities echoing through the corridors of my higher brain.</p><p>Still dazed by the discovery, I returned to my daily-driver 20B-powered LS400 and opened the toolbox that replaced its quarter panel after a little driver-training accident in the previous December. Within the concealed tool compartment, I would find my salvation. It also contained a slightly mangled fuel filler neck that I had to jiggle once in awhile while filling up or it would make the pump shut off prematurely.</p><p>When my supervisor returned from his break, and found that I had spent the first hour of my probationary period welding stolen hi-rail tracks to the exposed frame horns of a turbodiesel-swapped C3 Corvette, he was not pleased. I could feel my quarterly performance review score dropping even as I hooked up and began to tow a rail car full of what I hoped were parts cars behind me at high speed. It was unbelievable that he would look upon my initiative so harshly.</p><p>That’s the problem with the railroad, I yelled at him through the window net. Everyone is so stuck in the past. </p>

<p>One of the pervasive aspects of modern car culture is this obsession with lowering your hoopty. I’m sorry, but I just can’t live that low life like some people. No, for me, raised suspension is where it’s at. Backing it into corners, feeling that body roll, praying that I don’t hit an expansion joint and topple the entire mess over, that’s what legends are made of.</p><p>As you would expect in such a place, I found myself defending my lifestyle choices in Texas. A group of lowered drift cars had surrounded me in the parking lot of a Wynn-Dixie, sliding on welded diffs and tugging on comedically phallic handbrake handles. They issued a simple challenge: prove to them that my obscene suspension lift could run with the big boys on the local grip track, best out of three laps.</p><p>Although it was hard to speak through the sugary vape clouds emitted by the combination of the holed-out SR20 head gaskets and the drivers themselves, I acceded to their wishes and steeled myself for battle. The next day broke over a parched rural racetrack, its long-abandoned grip circuit cracked in the harsh Texan sun. Mixed surface, I thought with a chuckle while tying my hachimaki, this is going to be interesting.</p><p>Unfurling like a work of industrial pop art inbred with a venomous spider, I felt the spindly short-long-arm suspension of the Caravelle rock beneath me on the angriest launch my clumsy feet could manifest. Faux-whitewalls distorted under the side loads as the R-compounds that laid within grabbed a heapin’ helpin’ of track and shot me forward.</p><p>One of the 240SXs was a little faster through the corner than me, his non-suspension beating the driver half to death as it slid across the apex and disappeared into the straights. Maybe they were right about me, I thought, as I drove over the FIA regulation curb and through the infield of the track directly to the finish, forcing the 240SXes to swerve as I re-entered the racing line in a cloud of dirt, diesel particulate and grass.</p>

<p>In my time I’ve given the city planning department tons of criticism. Roads maintenance was no exception, even though they technically weren’t in the same department. To their credit, their members are at least literate, because after my last vaguely racist letter to the editor of our local newspaper (circulation: 8 people), the roads maintenance union paid me a visit.</p><p>There was a problem: the city management had taken a no-bid contract from a friend of the mayor to provide “smart asphalt” to all the roads in town. Self-healing, it would no longer require a team of between thirty and fifty dozen men to poke at it before scraping off the top layer and leaving it like that for a few months. Rumour had it, it was even resistant to potholes and wouldn’t corrode from road salt, lifted trucks or studded tires. It would put the roads maintenance guys out of business, and they really liked being in business.</p><p>There was a solution: a defector from the smart-asphalt company felt ethically conflicted about all the nano-scale megacancer it would cause, and decided to let the roads union know its innate weakness. The warranty wasn’t very good, and if you dumped enough heat into it, it would be voided instantly. They needed a man who could destroy a city block, but still have plausible deniability.</p><p>They had a deal in mind: I would become their Manchurian Commuter, and be equipped with a car of my choosing to void the warranty of the smart asphalt that threatened their livelihoods.</p><p>Picture if you will the Mayor’s inaugural announcement of the first city block of this new smart asphalt. It’s gleaming, unmarred by cars, gorgeous in the early summer sun, perfect in every way. Then some asshole in a 1994 Renault Twingo with a twincharged SR20VE does a burnout on it. That burnout lasts for so long, and reaches a heat so intense, that the road beneath begins to blister and flake away.</p><p>Before I have had a chance to destroy all of the road, my front tires have completed their conversion into gas, and explode as the belts let loose. The Mayor is pleased: I, and by extension my supporters in the union, have been defeated. His face turns to a mask of confusion when he notices I am still smiling.</p><p>Reaching down beneath the dash, I engage 4LO on the massively overbuilt GKN transfer case. The rear wheels of the angry little Renault light up. My automatic respirator keys up to Bioweapon Defense Mode as it detects the increased particulate in the air. I work the wheel to keep the Twingo pointed straight as it wiggles furiously on the bare racing steelies up front, the magnesium sparks thrown by the doomed wheels dancing across the heat-soaked road surface.</p><p>Too shocked to shut off the livestream, the Mayor’s announcement goes from routine to a genuine movement. I can hear the sound of straight-pipe exhaust crackling and bleach being poured on tires as other local maniacs descend upon the area, yearning to be part of this impromptu burnout challenge.</p><p>The next day, I hit a pothole and grimaced, imagining the imperceptible amount of alignment shift now present in my front right outer tie rod. In retrospect, I should have worked out a better deal with the roads maintenance union than “give me a free car and let me do burnouts in it.”</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you the story about how I got involved in advertising and made my first billion dollars? It was totally accidental, like everything that’s good in life. Well, except for my first-through-tenth-born children. I’m not a “details person,” you know.</p><p>My story begins in a small suburb of a smaller city. Ignoring the implausible geometry of such a place - I said <i>ignoring it</i>, stop thinking about it - the real problem was that our city planners simply did not plan very well. Roads were clogged. Construction backed commutes up for miles. Cul-de-sacs in front of schools were so packed with cute-utes and mini-crossovers dropping their children off that it was impossible to get within thirty miles of the place without suffering a two-hour commute penalty.</p><p>I was sitting behind the steering wheel of my AMC Hornet, its zoomies hungrily gulping air through the hood as the engine gently rocked. Before me was a nearly incomprehensible traffic jam. Drivers were on both sides of the road arbitrarily, halfway through turn lanes, driving over driveways, stuck into impossible positions. I think one guy somehow even got stuck inside the bus stop. A self-driving car next to me began constructing a right-of-way model, then caught fire as its gigacore law-obedience CPU became overheated from recursive overflow.</p><p>Maybe it was the exhaust leak in my cabin, or maybe it was destiny. Either way, my eyes began to drift up, up, <i>up</i> - and lo and behold, they saw a new LCD advertising sign parked on the side of the road. That sign was looking for clients.</p><p>The next morning, the first of my ads ran. They always started in soft focus, an idealized visual of a happy suburban family. Jump cut to a bunch of tombstones sitting in an abandoned field, overgrown with grass. The slogan: “WHY SPEND YOUR LIFE IN TRAFFIC? QUIT YOUR JOB TODAY.” I can assure you all the remaining ads were of about the same level of subtlety.</p><p>At first I did not think my gambit had worked. After all, people in our modern society were sophisticated, immune to advertising, masters of their own intellect. Surely rational thought had won out this day, I thought as I pulled into a completely empty street.</p><p>All that week, I found myself commuting happily to work, as the suckers who believed me sat at home, their dwindling paycheques buoyed by spending more time with their loved ones.</p>

<p>I had many complaints in life. First and foremost is that the explosive collar around my neck was pretty scratchy, and I was worried about it forming a horrible skin rash. My second complaint is that I had an explosive collar around my neck forcing me to repair elevators.</p><p>Back in the previous century, when things made more sense, we encountered a glut of out-of-maintenance elevators and no technicians to fix them. Every apartment building, every shopping mall, every government building was outfitted with elevators requiring frequent service, and the landlords and slumlords wouldn’t pony up the fat stacks that Big Elevator wanted for routine maintenance.</p><p>Driven down by the market, the value of an elevator maintenance contract began to plummet as they roped in less-talented, cheaper people. When the Prime Minister herself died at the hands of a poorly-maintained lift in Centre Block her second-in-command made a simple edict: anyone with a modicum of mechanical experience would be drafted, once per year, to repair as many elevators as they could.</p><p>To make things worse, they identified that a lot of people with mechanical experience were also very lazy. Hence the explosive collars. They called it flatline-rate, and I was mostly envious that I hadn’t come up with the pun first.</p><p>Before me sat a standard Schindler 5500 modular passenger elevator, the kind you would encounter in any apartment building. I had fifteen minutes to figure out why it sometimes had a bit of a hitchy feeling when it got to the top floor. The elevator took five minutes to reach that top floor, which meant testing was out of the question. I had to do things on instinct if I wanted to survive.</p><p>My instinct served me well: I opened my tool bag to release several bottles of Seafoam. Their metallic rattling as the gently dented cans rolled on the carpeted floor in a random orbit filled me with cheer, and my hands were already groping for a vacuum line to feed it into.</p><p>With seconds to spare, the Ministry determined that I had successfully repaired the elevator, and shut the collar off. I was on my way back out through the lobby, gingerly rubbing my raw neck skin, when I heard the screams of ordinary citizens as the elevator shaft became whited-out with delicious carbon-removal intake juice.</p>

<p>In the decade plus that I’d been working as a supernatural automobile mechanic, I’d never seen anything before or since like the Giving Forester. It seemed at first glance as if it was the corporeal prison housing a beneficial spirit. Those of us who stayed behind to observe it further and gain its acquaintance would soon find there was nothing beneficial about this Subaru.</p><p>I can remember the time well. Decade or so ago, back when I was still driving what was left of the ‘61 Apache. Together, we went to the town where the Giving Forester had been discovered. I greatly valued the time we spent together: every overblown throw of the Chevy’s column shifter was not just a way to keep moving efficiently, but a tribute to human survival and achievement on our lonely blue marble.</p><p>When I first received word of the Giving Forester, it was by the purchaser. He had bought the car from a small buy-here-pay-here lot just outside of town, the former owner lost to a combination of DMV incompetence and general slack regarding records-keeping in that part of the world. When he embarked upon the initial deconstruction and cleaning of the car, he found something strange.</p><p>For whatever reason, the back hatch of the Forester he had bought was chock full of 10mm sockets. Piled to the back window, in fact, a gleaming bounty weighing several hundred pounds. Smiling at his good luck, he began to shovel out the sockets, imagining himself never having to hunt around for the 10mm he dropped inside a fender or bumper beam ever again.</p><p>The next day, however, he tried to drive the Forester to work when he heard a jingling sound from the rear. At first it was assumed, as any Subaru owner would, to be heat shields. But then it was imagined, as any Subaru owner also would, that it could be terminal rod knock from oil starvation. The owner returned to the hatch, opening it to retrieve his spare oil and VIN-etching thermite kit lest it need to be left on the side of the road.</p><p>Again, the Giving Forester’s rear hatch was piled high with 10mm sockets. The man sat there, considering it. Shoveling out the sockets onto the side of the road, he retrieved the crushed jug of Rotella from beneath their gleaming pile.</p><p>Future experiments proved fruitful: when a 10mm socket was lost to human hands, say into a sewer grate or just into a particularly inconvenient part of the garage, it would re-appear in the back of the Giving Forester. He immediately consulted a priest, and the priest knew just who to call: not me.</p><p>Eventually, however, I had heard about it on Twitter, and so the Apache and I stepped into our reluctant role as foreign heroes. By the time we arrived in the city, the side of every road was littered with 10mm sockets. The reflection of their chrome-vanadium plating in the evening sun made it difficult to drive, but I persisted, the urge to get to the root of this mystery overriding any higher-brained caution.</p><p>I pulled into the driveway of the Giving Forester, its hatch door left open so as not to dimple the valuable confetti interior. Ejaculatory streams of jingling sockets were emitted constantly from this Old Faithful of a Japanese AWD econobox.</p><p>Kicking down the door to the owner’s house, I confronted him. I had the solution, I screamed, as he looked frantically around his bedroom for a weapon to use to defend him and his wife.</p><p>As we filled boxes of bulk sockets to ship to NAPA, I thought often about whether taking advantage of a strange locus of supernature was ethical. When the paycheques started rolling in, I thought a lot less about ethics and a lot more about Elans.</p>

<p>Cruise Night is one of those car-people concepts that ordinary people understand very well, yet whose true purpose eludes me. Admiring chrome was impossible for me due to a deficiency in my genetic makeup, and in fact none of my cars were what the television would call “vintage.” Obviously, when I was named head marshal of Cruise Night, I had to do something a little different.</p><p>On day two, the assembled lowboys and Bel Airs began to complain: their backs hurt, their incontinence medicine was running out. They simply did not expect the Cruise Night location to be so far away, and had expected, you know, a single night. I listened to their complaints, considered them deeply.</p><p>Near the end of the week, the chromed-alternator crowd began to drop out for mechanical failures. I had trusted deputies help to repair their cars, removing style and grace in order to replace them with brutal efficiency snatched from junkyard returns aisles and the parts-bin truck following the convoy.</p><p>The chosen people I had led were now tired, thirsty, with sore backs and various genital malfunctions. Their spirits were broken, and they willingly climbed aboard the seafaring ship that I had parked at the docks.</p><p>For weeks more, we rode on the high sea, the spirit of Cruise Night in our hearts as we swapped stories about five-hundred horsepower Chevy 305s and the 100 mile-per-gallon carburetor. Wrenching was done, again under the tutelage of me and my lieutenants. At last I felt a sharp thumping, and assembled the group.</p><p>We disembarked in Germany, a convoy of flaming, blacked-out nightmare machines with sharp edges everywhere and sunken-eyed loners behind the wheel. The police refused or were frightened to bring us in for equipment violations, and we made our trip to the Nurburgring, forcing underengined Polos and terrified Bedford Rascals into the ditches along the way.</p><p>Cruise Night became Colonize Night, and I’ve lived here ever since, in my lashed-together throne of driveshafts and men’s skeletons.</p>

<p>Economists and social workers will tell you all about how “the sharing economy” is leading to precarious employment, but you know what’s really precarious? Trying to drive a four hundred horsepower Pinto wagon.</p><p>With credentials like that, picking up a few bucks doing same-day delivery made sense. What’s more, I got a chance to hit the Amazon warehouse for parts deals directly.</p><p>I was in the process of checking the dead-stock bins for Escort EXP tie rod ends when the call came in from headquarters. Some vulnerable startup needed a stock delivery of pens and Phantom drones <i>stat</i>, and they were willing to pay for the damage I did to my R-compounds on the way over.</p><p>Working the handbrake with one hand as I pulled the hatch release with the other, the powered high-load shelf in the back of the Pinto exposed itself to the workers at the loading dock. They had become infinitely familiar with my antics over the years, so much so that they involuntarily shrouded their major mucus membranes as I finalized the load process and lit up the rear meats.</p><p>Cross-town traffic at this time of day was always difficult, not just because of rush hour but because of local law enforcement’s widely-stated disdain for my diesel-and-rubber-particulate antics. I was going to have to go under the radar, which is difficult when you drive a rare-as-hell shooting-brake Ford.</p><p>I was just coming out of the exchange tunnel when traffic ahead of me stopped dead. I slammed on the brakes, flaring the eight-piston front calipers in a motion not unlike that of a butterfly. The thing with butterflies is, when they flap their wings, weird shit happens. I felt a ginger tap from behind as an Acura MDX’s radar cruise control module failed to look up from her phone in time.</p><p>Fear shot into my veins, a cold steel grip. I just got rear-ended in a <i>Pinto</i>. Thoughts of immolation raced through my mind. I could hear myself hyperventilate as I climbed out of the car, nearby pedestrians fleeing for cover lest the Death Ford consume them as well in a paroxysm of rapid oxidation.</p><p>The Acura owner stared at me in horror as I emerged from the car, somehow alive. Smiling, I gestured to the crude cut-outs in the hood and the Cummins 4BT that angrily ticked away, furious that fuel pressure had been imperceptibly reduced by the now-leaking fuel tank.</p>

<p>Becoming a millionaire hasn’t changed me very much. I still make terrible barbeque, I will always lie to everyone I can, and most of all I always have a bunch of bad cars populating my property. It’s just that now the property is quite a bit larger.</p><p>My predicaments are pretty similar to those before I was rich also: sometimes all my cars break at once and I only have one to go get parts in. So it was today, as I drove into the Pick N Pull in my boring daily driver.</p><p>When I emerged from the junkyard, clutching a filthy D16Z6 head, I noticed a throng of junkyard rats around my vehicle. I thought this was strange, as there were almost no desirable or interchangeable parts on my daily. Plus, I grumbled to myself, it had an automatic transmission.</p><p>Popping the trunk got their attention, and I threw the head into the cavernous maw of the car. Normally, for something really nice like my confetti-interiored JDM STI wagon, I would put a towel down to protect the carpet. But this was just a daily beater, and as such it deserved no special treatment.</p><p>On the way out, one of the junkyard rats motioned for me to roll down my window. I did so, also intending to ask him for gossip about what the other yards in town might have for fresh drops.</p><p>“Dude, is that a Rolls Royce Wraith?” he was practically hysterical.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and answered in the affirmative. “It’s the only car I have that runs,” I explain sheepishly, but then realize that I don’t need to explain myself to this guy and his Grand Am.</p><p>“You know, I have a Mustang II King Cobra at home,” I started, the irritation weighing on my voice, “but nobody ever gets excited about seeing one of <i>those</i>.”<br/></p><p>Piece of shit Rolls can’t even do a burnout, I grumbled as the window rolled up and the traction control light began to flash under the throttle angle I requested. At least the gravel bouncing off the bottom wasn’t louder than the stereo.</p>

<p>There’s a curse to being the office’s “weird car guy:” when something mechanical breaks, it is often your responsibility - no, your <i>duty</i> - to repair it as best you can. Usually this took the form of giving a coworker a jump start or coaching them through how to change a flat tire over the phone. Those rote tasks began to wear upon me, and I cried to the gods for something that would challenge my skills and maybe impress some of my coworkers for once.</p><p>The thing about taunting the gods is that sometimes the gods come down to give you a pretty good shove.</p><p>I walked into the office, bleary from lack of sleep, my fingernails caked with moly grease from some horrible project or another. I could not reasonably tell you which of my hoopties had been restored to running condition to make the trip to work. They were waiting for me.</p><p>A coworker gestured impatiently to the office water cooler, often a font of activity. It stood mute, still, the little bubble-making motor having died. Some part of me could sense it from the parking lot, and began to wake up the surrounding neurons in an attempt to fix things. Without saying a word, I knelt down and removed the front panel of the water cooler, breaking several irreplaceable trim clips.</p><p>Hmm. Broken <i>and</i> shoddily built? that’s just insulting.</p><p>I will never understand why my coworkers didn’t want to get water from the resulting cooler. In my efforts, I had gone to specific lengths to ensure that the new pump had an appropriately-sized engine that wouldn’t scare them with too much horsepower. As God is my witness, I didn’t think a Kohler 440 two-stroke twin with a Roots blower would spray that much water across the office.</p>

<p>My phone vibrates across the desk with an insistent ring, and at first I am excited to see what kind of Pokemon it has detected. To my great horror, I find out that in actuality it is a “phone call.” The advertising agency hired by Tourism Lac La Biche begins to speak to me, the imperious manner of the Corporate Voice obvious even from the thousand miles of distance I have strained to put between me and the open-pit mine of human suffering that is the Devil’s Own Town.</p><p>Every story has a beginning, although my psychiatrists (both court-ordered and off-the-street-volunteer) often plead with me that not every beginning needs a story. Those guys don’t know what they’re missing, and part of what they’re missing is my story of ripping a front-wheel-drive burnout capable of changing things forever.</p><p>You should have seen it: the burnout was a one-tire fire of such volume and ferocity that the local volunteer fire department issued an all-hands scramble order. Dozens of Pontiac Sunfires in semi-official livery responded, their dented panels, loose bumper clips and dangling mufflers resplendent in the low late afternoon winter sun. Locals were curious as to what was happening at the local Superstore, and began to form a mass around the furious smoke cloud.</p><p>At last, the stupid-rigid tire compound of the 160,000-km-prorated-warrantied Canadian Tire specials could no longer deal with the heat and began to chunk, hurling at first rubber and then bits of gradually-increasing cord as the wheelspeed continued to grow, the engine now less and less burdened by the twin curses of friction and rotating mass.</p><p>As the Pontiacs reach me, their eBay lightbars flashing federally-unmandated shades of caution amber into my rear view mirror, I drop the handbrake lever and crabwalk my way out of the parking lot, narrowly dodging both a gaping pothole and a heroin-addicted senior stumbling home from the Legion.</p><p>A lack of anything that could even be called pseudo-official response gives me precious seconds to make good my escape. That escape is not without effort, however, and summoning up all the fury living within the D15′s one-hundred-and-almost-three brake horsepower forces sweat to bead upon my forehead.</p><p>The catspaw of Tourism Lac La Biche wants to know what happened. I gulp, wondering if maybe their two-officer RCMP detachment needs to question me in an <i>official capacity</i> for my stunting antics. Luckily, my sense of relief is palpable when she asks me how I would score the town’s roadworks on a scale of one to ten, ten being best and one being worst.</p><p>“One,” I say, “it was very slippery.”<br/></p>

<p>When you’ve been a celebrity for as long as I have, you start to detect patterns in what other people ask you. I would have adoring fans come up to me at comic conventions and pull on my sleeve, ask me for a story about Sweet Chili Heat, the RX7 that stole my heart. Okay, so maybe it’s more like ‘pattern.’</p><p>Sweet Chili Heat, though - <i>man</i>, what a car. The adventures we had together were historic. I would never trust myself to directly interact with such a fine steed, having seen its owners rendered permanently deaf by the 12A’s constant entreaties to find the outer reaches of human existence. I served as their interpreter, following always at a minimum safe distance in a responsible, mature car with airbags. Also, I dashcammed the fireballs it would roll out every time someone even thought about lifting.</p><p>One morning the Chili Phone rang, and I picked up. It was the Commissioner. Turns out there were antics afoot in the national parks, he said. It was imperative to assemble the Sweet Chili Heat Task Force. By your word it is done, I said in my most sanctimonious British-television-presenter voice, and slammed the handset back into its cradle hard enough to make me question why we still owned a corded phone in this, the Year Of Our Lord 2016.</p><p>I smirked as we blew through the major highways, wildlife scattering from the neighboring trees as some deep instinctual component of their being detected hatred, fear and pain - so much pain - emanating from Sweet Chili Heat. Let them run, I said to myself, our quarry believes themselves evolved past the instincts of nature.</p><p>Here’s the thing about national parks. They’re full of Germans. Hiking, canoeing, mountain bicycling, they love to do all of these things. Now, ordinarily, it’s no big problem. Today was not an ordinary day, and you could tell from the unbroken queue of gridlocked traffic trying to leave the auxiliary cruiseway in the trees. The Commissioner believed that a family of German tourists were taking high-quality photography of brown bears from the panoramic moonroof of their rented Kia Sedona, and it was plugging the whole thing up.</p><p>I would have told Sweet Chili Heat what to do, but somehow they - or the car, it was hard to tell at this point in the evolution - already knew. If you watched the news that night, you would see a forest on fire, shocked into spontaneous cellular combustion from the pure sound energy of the 12A’s aggressive streetport.</p><p>In the middle of a field reduced to inferno, Sweet Chili Heat performed a celebratory donut, clods of dirt bursting from the cursed Earth to strike ineffectually at its sharks-mouthed quarter panels. At last, the RX7 finished its donut and released a super-rich cloud of exhaust mixture, depriving the area of oxygen instantly. Ash fell upon our heads. I could sense that the car was pleased. It’d sleep well tonight.</p>

<p>The President was convening a summit on renewable energy sources, and I knew that they didn’t keep the back door of the conference hall locked very well. With these credentials, it was no surprise that I would bring in the future of Western civilization.</p><p>“Gentlemen, there is a fuel that we have been ignoring,” I say, reaching the podium before the security guards can pull me off stage.<br/></p><p>“That fuel is <i>nitromethane</i>. It comes from pig farts and shit.”<br/></p><p>A weedy man from the FDA looks up, pushes his glasses upward so he can bring me into focus as I slug a guard across the mouth, knocking him backward into the impromptu mosh pit formed by the President’s fan-boys and -girls.</p><p>“But I heard Vin Diesel said nitromethane was for pussies,” he stated, quoting a documentary that both of us had probably seen on Turner Classic Movies the night before.<br/></p><p>“Not so, good chum,” I boast, striding across the stage as guards rush me. Although their nightsticks hurt, the power of <i>justice</i> is on my side, and I handily overpower them with only my righteous fury and the less-lethal concentrated energy weapon that I carry on my belt at all times for jump-starting hoopties.</p><p>I pull down an empty projector screen and gesture to it as if it contains the secret to life itself. It does.</p><p>“As you can see, nitromethane burns completely invisibly. This makes it way better than diesel, of which you can see smoke. We all know visible smoke is bad.”</p><p>The crowd agrees, and I am loft onto their shoulders in a celebratory parade through the conference centre. Later, at the Nobel Prize ceremony, they ask me what my secret was.</p><p>“I’m no hero - I just wanted cheap nitrometh at the pump,” I said, yelling loudly in a vain attempt to be heard over the ear-splitting nitro cackle of the sub-liter economy cars on the street outside.<br/></p>

<p>Giving a lunch-and-learn talk at NASA is challenging at the best of times. The engineers keep you on your toes, asking loaded questions and then laughing at your simplified answers. You gotta bring your A-game, or at least in my case my A-Body.</p><p>Leaving the Valiant half-parked on the JPL bike rack, I saunter inside. The presentation, a quick demonstration of how I managed to break the laws of physics by constantly stacking superchargers on top of superchargers until they formed a perpetual motion machine, goes fairly well. I can see at the back there’s a junior engineer who has a question. I call on him, and that’s where things go wrong.</p><p>“So my uncle says that you can’t kill an AMC 4.0. We tried, but it didn’t work. Have you ever killed an AMC 4.0?”<br/></p><p>I thought about it. I sweated. I thought hard. No, I hadn’t. I bet it was possible, though, and I’d love to find out.</p><p>Even from the other side of the auditorium, I could see him smiling and immediately regretted my boast. That’s how I ended up in the JPL lobby, next to a 1989 Cherokee they had found in the woods behind the CNC shop. The surrounding balconies and overhangs were thronged by NASA engineers who wanted to see me kill an AMC 4.0 or be branded a fraud forever.</p><p>The Jeep happily accepted the bolts and wood screws that I carried in my pockets at all times. I reflected on how pretty the tinkling sound was as chunks of cat substrate were ejected onto the tile floor via the rust holes in the once-muffler.</p><p>

Pouring quick-mix concrete directly into the open throttle body slowed down one of the cylinders, but didn’t demonstrably impact the others. After pinning the throttle, I saw chunks of shattered concrete depart the muffler, to deposit on top of the pile of screws.

<br/></p><p>Draining the oil and running the doomed Cherokee at wide open throttle, fed entirely on oxy-acetylene for fifteen minutes, didn’t do much to put a dent in it either. My trained ear could sense a bit of valve flutter, but to my frustration it went away as soon as the Jeep returned to idle. The junior engineer gave me a shit-eating grin, his arms crossed in a gesture of smug superiority. I was gonna need to step it up a bit.</p><p>I had just one trick up my sleeve. I removed a critical part from my Valiant, and threw it deep into the woods. Now stranded with no way to get to the parts store except for the Jeep, the Cherokee immediately windowed the block and bled to death.</p><p>Yup. Nothing feels better than winning, I thought, and asked my host if he had a metal detector or something in his science lab.</p>

<p>If a man’s home is his castle, then the neighbourhood around it must be that castle’s moat. Your neighbours are the only thing that can protect you from the wolves of disaster capitalism. They keep an eye out for burglars, general undesirables, and above all a change to culture. The community-association doubles as an immune system, overreacting to any foreign element that was within. Over the years I had grown from that same “foreign element” to an accepted member of their society, attending even their community bake sales and alley parties to celebrate cowboy culture and lifted pickup trucks. That is not to say that everyone was so lucky, or that I wasn’t deluding myself.</p><p>A few summers ago, I noticed on my daily constitutional that a house formerly for sale was now occupied by a series of third-gen Camaros and Firebirds. Another hobbyist, I thought, making keen note of the TBI 305 that was sitting in the bed of a nearby truck with a sticky note reading “FREE - PLEASE TAKE - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE TAKE” on its head. One day, perhaps, I would introduce myself to him, maybe borrow a few tools or have him come over to hold up an exhaust manifold while I did the header-bolt dance.</p><p>Such dreams were folly, and within a week he had evaporated from the neighbourhood, the house again empty. It wasn’t the first time it had happened, either. I began to think that perhaps there was some unknown force preventing F-bodies from taking root in my community.</p><p>At the community association meeting, my ears perked up when I overheard two seniors gossiping about the “Camaro folk.” Not being one to tip my hand, I waited until the end of the meeting and tailed the more informed of the pair to his house. Imagine my surprise when, rather than arriving in his own driveway, he took me down a dirt road to an abandoned warehouse. My cover by now was surely blown, but out of the spirit of Canadian politeness it would have been awkward for him to have stopped his Lexus RX350 and yelled at the strange AMC Hornet following close behind.</p><p>Suddenly the RX350 disappeared into the warehouse. I followed, warily, on foot. That’s when the floodlights came up, blinding me. I failed to place either voices or faces as they addressed me in unison, a rehearsed chant of an anti-Camaro death cult.</p><p>“PUSHRODS NEVER, OVERHEAD CAMSHAFTS FOREVER,” they chanted, the banging of breaker bars against hollow steel railings filling the gaps between their words.</p>

<p>Usually, when you hit your head and are rendered unconscious, you just awake slightly relaxed and impatient because you had a lot of stuff to do today. This wasn’t one of those times, I was beginning to realize, as I was surrounded by the ghosts of the many cars I had owned and killed.<br/></p><p>First up of course was the loyal, dependable Camry that I had bought as a teenager to get me to my many important part-time mall jobs. Its voice was unexpected, a terrible vibrato that caught in my chest with every phoneme.</p><p>“Why didn’t you check my oil?” it begged, half-sobbing. “I gave you enough lifter tick to warn astronauts on the moon!” Perhaps my experience with the Camry is what caused my orbit to become more erratic, drifting further and further from mainstream automotive tastes in a quest for retribution, to save another. If that was the case, there were plenty more examples here of how I had failed.<br/></p><p>I was about to apologize, but then another car of the circle rolled forwards, its voice shaking my eardrums. I forced down the fear in my throat and fixated with my gaze the International Scout II. The conditions of its departure from my life were simple: I put one wheel wrong trying to dodge a series of angry Suzuki owners at a salvage-vehicle auction. Once the terrible roll had completed, its back was broken: it’d never jump again.</p><p>Before the Scout could finish its tale of woe, I knew what was coming next. Some part of my body would always react to the sound of the oversized wheel bearings of a rear-steer Rockwell, and it did so here. I grudgingly turned to accept my biggest failure into my life.</p><p>The long, <i>long</i> wheelbase Mustang SVO limousine glared down upon me from its monster-truck perch atop 50-inch mud terrain tires. I gulped.</p>

<p>You know that emotion you feel when an XR4Ti blows past you on the highway, blessing your journey with the magic Germanic-Briton-Ford powers of boosted single-slammer torque? I was feeling that emotion this very morning, as my idle finger-drumming on the wheel gave way to white knuckle grip and I felt a familiar prickling sensation on the back of my neck. <i>Another was near</i>.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to catch up with the weird-named Ford, and after only a few kilometers of full-throttle pull, the Ratty had to stop at the next gas station to refill its tank of (I sneered) <i>pump gas</i>. What an amateur. Still, it gave me a good chance to meet the kind of person who would own a Merkur and somehow not already be known to me.</p><p>When the helmet came off, I gasped. Merkur looked just like me, but with a saucy ethnic flair that I suspected the ladies found irresistable. He was just as shocked to come face to face with me, and before long we had settled on a subset of pidgin English accentuated by mouthed engine noises that we could use as a common vocabulary.</p><p>In the years that followed, we discovered that there was one of us in every country, somehow planted by secret operatives of the United Nations’ many environmental task forces to make the concept of the internal combustion engine unpalatable to the common man. We were wired from birth to drive the most repulsive beaters, the loudest exhausts, the biggest, most ridiculous forced induction. What they never counted on was that my Syrian counterpart would go on vacation one morning and find a $500 Merkur outside of the airport hotel.</p><p>It was a rainy early July morning, the kind that the denizens of Hokkaido had come to expect. Flashing some lazy Photoshop work around the many bars of the small island’s coasts eventually pointed us to a dilapidated farmhouse outside Muroran. On the horizon, you could see the dim outline of a nuclear reactor containment vessel, the town’s only industry before the world turned against the power of the atom.</p><p>We knew we had found the right place as our convoy of beaters, stuffed to the brim with JDM parts, crept down the entrance road. Somehow he had figured out that we were coming, the long path to his place studded with salvaged Big Red trikes, the sort of deadly-yet-tantalizing trap one such as us would construct.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I ended up as the cover story on NHK News for a little one-wheel squeal leaving a parking lot. My defense lawyer at the time told me that it was unheard of for a citizen of Japan to be seen doing brutal burnouts of the kind people like me could get away with all the time “where you came from.”</p><p>I could feel my hackles raise as I prepared to berate him for his workaday racism against the proud white people, but then realized my phone wallpaper was me launching a thirty-seven-foot-tall spiral of snow into low earth orbit thanks to the Ramcharger, before I had to flee the country due to having destroyed an RCMP anti-crime drone with the driveshaft it threw out halfway through. I grudgingly admitted he had a point.</p><p>Did the Japanese legal system understand that I could not be separated from motor vehicles for over a week before something very bad happened? They did not, and it was such that I was thrown into an (admittedly quite nice) foreigners’ prison, where I learned to play poker with a bunch of other white people who didn’t speak the same language as me. They were pretty nice even though they were honkies, I guess.</p><p>Exactly one week had elapsed since I was arrested, and as promised, something very bad did indeed happen. It manifested in the baby-shit-brown omen of the Trans Am Turbo, which had somehow managed to transport itself across an entire ocean to come looking for me. The Japanese prison guards attempted to strike the third-generation F-body, an icon of foreign law-scoffery of the highest sort made real before them. They didn’t stand a chance, as the Trans Am Turbo’s resulting fit of white-hot anti-lag exhaust scattered the brave riot police of the dangerous-foreigners jail to the far reaches of the room as it spiraled its twin ninety-millimeter billet turbochargers to peak operating speed.</p><p>Climbing aboard, the Trans Am Turbo and I shot through the mountains of Hokkaido, in search for respite from the Nissan Laurels and turbo Legacies of the metropolitan police force. Some force beyond myself queried their intentions, and I told them that burnouts were illegal in Japan, that they were public disorder of the highest sort and would be frowned upon. I felt only pealing cackles of laughter from the force, and the Trans Am immediately pulled a U-turn so sharp I cracked two ribs.</p><p>That evening, in downtown Shibuya, a loose amalgamation of Shinto priests near the train station scattered for cover. Beneath the eye of a whirling dark tsunami appearing inbound from Tokyo Bay, the Trans Am Turbo spoke the opening words of the burnout that would end the world.</p>

<p>My crankcase-flavoured coffee cooled on an empty windowsill, abandoned in my haste to get to the airport. I could still hear the coolant crackling through the turbochargers as I leapt the counter at the park-and-fly lot to save the precious few seconds to my flight to Cuba.</p><p>On the way there, my all-too-eager seatmate turned out to be a mid-level true believer at a local multi-level-marketing scheme. He was going there for the same reason I was: to sell them the garbage that North Americans were too snobbish to own. 

I could see in his eyes the zealotry of the deal. His bag was packed to the brim with Donald Trump how-to manuals, hardcover, <i>signed</i>. We decided then and there to join forces.</p><p>You should have seen us: we tore across the Cuban shield with our medicine-show routine, selling them air-cooled 70s turbochargers, penny-pinchingly thin OEM swaybars, and long-discredited electric supercharger kits to go with their snake oil and astronaut-flavoured vitamin shakes. The parts-hungry Cubans snapped up anything and everything they could use to make their hoopties faster, meaner, <i>better</i>, and by the time they remembered that they could just use eBay, Summit and RockAuto now, we were long gone to the next town.</p><p>At last we rolled up to the big prize, the dilapidated VAZ-2106 that I had pilfered from a farmhand in exchange for a set of parts-store 302 chrome valve covers beginning to show the strain of one too many close calls with the local peasantry. Millions of parts customers existed in Havana, and they all wanted stock parts. I raided my basement so fast one of the local FedEx offices literally caught fire from the friction.

</p><p>On the flight home, I could tell that my business partner was growing uneasy with the transaction. Perhaps he had grown a conscience by accident in that one small town which served us flapjacks “American style,” had fallen in with the local flavour and thought it was wrong to run them up the flagpole in exchange for two basis points on the vig sheet at the end of the year. I tried to put it out of my mind, deciding that we would part ways as soon as the tires touched good old North American soil.</p><p>The next morning, I broke the reverse switch on my daily-driver Civic. Hesitant to be pulled over by law enforcement and have them discover my true nature, I went to my basement to retrieve it from my copious stock of spares. To my horror, I discovered the error of my ways. My basement was wall-to-wall bare. Every shelf was devoid of the spare parts I had spent so much effort to squirrel away. All I was left with were these worthless millions of dollars.</p>

<p>“Teach the controversy,” the nice government man told the assembled crowd that morning in the teacher’s lounge. To be honest, we were pretty much just being polite out of obligation since he brought us all those donuts, but it made me start thinking about the nature of truth.<br/></p><p>My ruminations carried me all the way to the auto shop class of which I taught. In this day and age of slashed budgets and non-existent trades jobs, the humble auto class was all too often a target of well-meaning bureaucrats who wanted to save themselves a nice safety cushion of year-end bonus. If I were to <i>teach the controversy</i>, however, my little auto shop class becomes unimpeachable, a bastion of free speech that would have stalwart defenders. Especially if those defenders didn’t really realize what I was up to until it was too late.</p><p>I seated myself at my desk, and contemplated the 1979 Chevette Scooter on the lift. This was a perfect example. Common knowledge places the Chevette as a turd, a sign of America’s failure to compete with the Japanese on our own shores. Whistling while I worked, my humble teachers’ notebook began to fill with ridiculous statements that teenagers would believe.</p><p>At last the bell rang, and my brave charges stumbled in, eyes bright with hope for a future of turning wrenches and swearing at hose clamps. When they settled in, I rose dramatically from my perch and began to speak.</p><p>“Harley Earl never died, boys,” I bellowed, “and if we get this baby over three hundred wheel horsepower, we can <i>bring him back</i>.”<br/></p>

<H1>The Little Bluebird</H1>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a little Datsun Bluebird. It came from its home country to be loved in another, but there was something missing.</p><p>Every morning the little Bluebird woke up and said “I wanna go fast!”<br/></p><p>But the engine of the little Bluebird always said, “Not today, buddy. We have to drive responsibly, and preserve fuel while producing very few emissions. It’s the safe thing to do.”</p><p>Every corner the little Bluebird took notice and said “I wanna grip this corner, and rocket out of it like my ass is on fire!”</p><p>But the driver of the little Bluebird always said, “Not today, buddy. You are a rear wheel drive and they’re scary to drive fast. We might crash.”</p><p>One day a BMW 320i cut off the little Bluebird in traffic, and the little Bluebird said “I want to curb-stomp that Nazi bastard so hard the radiator support stoves backwards into its cams and I can hear the sound of its valves snapping one by one.”</p><p>But the <i>new</i> driver of the little Bluebird said “Okay.”</p><p>One credit card later, the little Bluebird got its wish. The little Bluebird got rid of its tiny naysayer engine, its smog-choked carb and its unpredictable beam-axle rear suspension.</p><p>Every morning the little Bluebird woke up and said “I wanna go fast!”</p><p>The 62 millimeter CNC-machined billet compressor wheel of the GT35 said “Yes.”</p>

<p>I have this need, I guess you could call it. No, more like a <i>compulsion</i>, digging at my mind with barbed hooks. Either way, I found myself having to explain it to the warehouse clerk as I picked up an entire shipping pallet of anime-character love pillows from the Purolator desk. For some reason she didn’t want to hear it, which was just as well by me.</p><p>You see, my compulsion is that I have to commute really fast. Once, a long time ago, I read this article about how commute time was the primary discriminator of happiness. Imagine my surprise - before the scientists chimed in and ruined everything, I had thought the primary discriminator of happiness was <i>usable torque band</i>. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. How did most people get to work? By car. And how did most cars get to work? Faster than walking.</p><p>Still with me on this? Good, because the inductive leap we’re about to take is a big one: the <i>primary way for me to be happier is to abuse the car-pool lane</i>. But I had no friends who wanted to go the same direction (or even had actual day-jobs to speak of), and my coworkers who were going the same way for some reason refused to get into my vehicle with me. Whether it was the failed lunch runs or just my general attitude towards never talking while driving so I could detect new rattles, I was alone.</p><p>That’s when it hit me: <i>anime love pillows</i>. What was once a Tumblr meme for ironic Donald Trump fetish blogs would become my saviour. I immediately speed-read Honda factory service manuals in order to learn enough functional Japanese to order a series of character pillows from my favourite Japanese animated feature.</p><p>I didn’t get very far when my twincharged Accord Aerodeck was pulled over by the authorities. Apparently a series of love pillows shaped like Toyota AE86s don’t look enough like actual human beings (racism!) to qualify as other occupants in a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>A crackling voice hesitantly emerged from the Bluetooth speaker zip-tied to the pegboard above my head. “Tell me,” it questioned, “why do you persist in trying to make everything you touch produce <i>more power</i>?”</p><p>Air rushed from my nostrils as I grunted in anger. I was trying to make it produce more <i>torque</i>. Here I was thinking we were starting to understand each other, court-ordered psychiatrist. Within a few minutes of polite discussion, half-remembered, half-fictionalized stories from my childhood, they seemed pleased, and the teleconference was complete. I was only partially present, as most of my attention had been pre-occupied with dropping a new-old-stock K-cam into the turbocharged B23 that laid before me.</p><p>When people think of Volvos, I’m told, they think of <i>safety</i>. Reason. Restraint. Comfort. A safe harbour in a cold, random universe whose sole reason for existence is the ultimate demise and suffering of its inhabitants. This particular Volvo is more on the universe’s side. Especially its barnstormer of an engine, raised from its humble birth in a Swedish barn to form an international relations department in concert with its immense Chinese turbocharger in order to send gasoline to the natural end of all things. That was pretty poetic, I thought. Might be time to apply for that arts funding again, see if I can get them to pay for a new progressive controller.</p><p>I hoisted the engine on the ceiling-mounted hoist and plunked it ever so sweetly onto the front subframe’s mounting boss. A little more swearing and knuckle-busting later, and the monster was once again in peak form, as if Samson found some hair extensions and was a little creative with Gorilla glue.</p><p>As the 245 found its first teetering steps like a newborn fawn, I could already tell that it was something else. I did so by my usual scientific mechanism: I called it the homeowners’ association dyno. Calculating torque was pretty easy: just rip a burnout in the middle of your driveway and count the seconds until the HOA sends an officially-stickered “COMMUNITY PACE CAR” to criticize you for antisocial behaviour. By that metric, this baby was an <i>eleven-second</i> car.</p><p>When I debuted at the Volvo meet, I could see terrified eyes staring out from behind the Ikea cart-return shed. Not even their customary Tuesday-evening snack of confusingly-named cookies and lingonberry ale could save them, and they knew it. My snorting wagon was a rolling testament to an uncaring God’s wrath upon this earth, and they were the slothful sinners who had been asleep at the switch of moderate horsepower goals.

</p><p>If you thought that metaphor mixing was impressive, you should have seen the second bank of dedicated E85 injectors that kicked in when I tried to figure out what my homeowners’ association dyno number was at the Ikea’s altitude. The resulting burnout cloud carried its own weather, and the lightning strikes at the hatch of the wagon only cemented my impending reputation as that asshole who ruins the meet for everyone else.</p>

<p>She picked up the handset on the other side of the glass, her ruby-red nails clacking gently on the Bakelite handle. I had already started reflexively flinching so that by the time the full weight of invective had left her mouth I would not be completely destroyed.</p><p>“Is this about the two stroke V8?” was all she was curious about.<br/></p><p>My two stroke V8. How did she know about it? Of course - I must have spoken of my white rabbit in the middle of the night, when the strange mist of unconsciousness clouds men’s minds and brings their true desires to light. I begin to hyperventilate and sweat, a reaction that does not go unnoticed. My visitor clicks the phone back onto its carrier, and gets up to leave. A futile attempt to rap on the glass, get her attention, get her to post bail, is unnoticed. I’m in here for the duration.</p><p>When I was a small child, I fell out of a fishing boat on a trip with the least alcoholic of my uncles. It wasn’t my fault; my uncle ripped the throttle a little hard and the torque buck knocked my uncoordinated eight-year-old ass plain out of the boat. I guess you could say that torque made me what I was today. Either way, by the time my head broke water again, I would never be the same.</p><p>I tried my best to keep the urges within me at bay. I moved to a landlocked state, stayed away from lakes, rivers, docks, even that booth at the annual carnival where there are little remote-controlled boats that you can drive around for five minutes in exchange for a dollar. Such a lust can never be kept at bay for long, and almost monthly I would find myself gazing at a passing boat on the highway, or be feeding an impulse-bought yachting magazine to my office shredder lest it consume me.</p><p>One night, I went to take out the trash. In front of my neighbour’s house, an Evinrude two-stroke V8 laid on the pavement, its passenger head gasket irretrievably blown. I knew him to be a man of means but little ability, and reckoned it could be fixed. It needed me, after all, and it would be rude to ignore the plight of this little motor just because I had a problem with nautical products.</p><p>I don’t remember exactly when I got fired from my job for not showing up anymore, but it was probably during the time when I was hand-welding long-runnered expansion chambers to get the crunchiest, nastiest sound and the most bone-crushing power out of my white whale. But an engine alone can’t take you somewhere, and as I contemplated my malaise further my roving eye settled, as if guided by my unconscious, on a nearby Dodge Diplomat, sinking on flat tires into the very macadam that I had retrieved the Evinrude from. It was provenance, and nobody would miss it.</p><p>My wife had suspicions, sure. The five o’ clock shadow on my face slowly became more of a lumberjack beard, and the garage evolved from a leftover-house-parts junk pile to its more lethal form of what looked at first glance like a Stacey David car show set on fire in slow motion. She didn’t say anything, not until that morning in county jail.</p><p>On the day I fired it up, the sky was the colour of a baby-boomer metaphor about analogue television, clouds hanging low over the not-colour of the sky. I had been tracking a persistent headache that refused to leave me for weeks on end, infecting my comprehension of all but the Diplomat. When I sat in it, or laid hands upon it, the haze would clear. Some part of me hoped that with this final turn of the key I would at last have a sharp, perfect view of my destiny.</p><p>It was not to be. Lured by my crackling wail, law enforcement could not help but be summoned. They found me outside the Cabela’s, the evidence of my two-dozen tire shredding donuts as plain on the parking lot as my trunk filled to the brim with specialty high-zinc Evinrude two-stroke oil. I was separated from the Diplomat, torn from the machine that allowed me to expose my most closeted boat impulses in broad daylight for all to see.</p><p>From my cell window as I awaited trial, I could see it sitting in the impound lot, its sagging sealed-beam headlight trim performing an anthropomorphized sad-puppy routine that I know would pull in another unsuspecting victim. Perhaps at the seized-property auction this saga would come full circle, an uncle and his favourite nephew, ready to scar another indelibly in the cruelly dwindling days of the two-stroke.</p><p>My cellmate liked boats, too. He wanted to tell me about the Carnival cruises he took, where he had killed his previous victims. Diesel, I thought to myself. It figured.</p>

<p>They said, centuries ago, that the Trans Am Turbo was God’s punishment for an unfair world. It could be destroyed, but never permanently. When the Trans Am Turbo manifested, each time it would choose a driver. The gentlemen I was sharing a conspiratorial meeting with were convinced it had to be me. Only I could harness its power for the good of mankind, rather than just doing endless burnouts in front of a Dairy Queen before it chucked white-hot tire belts through the windshield of the closest Dodge Journey.</p><p>In the years leading up to that night, whenever our researchers would dust off an ancient tomb, a long-forgotten library, its headlights would be staring back at them. Gradually we began to realize the Trans Am Turbo was an ever-present actor in human history. Scripture was consulted, cave paintings, ancient Roman government records. It probably won’t surprise you to know that the Pontiac appeared to great men throughout history, lending them the torque they needed to accomplish their deeds. 

</p><p>At last my superiors believed they had determined the conditions of the car’s approval, and wished to present me as the ideal new driver for the Pontiac. My superiors were fools.</p><p>I traveled to a long-abandoned drive-in movie theatre, the last recorded location of the F-body in the modern era, and waited. In the hope of currying favour with it, I had picked an excellent car. The 1988 Fiero GT would indicate to the Trans Am just what kind of man I was, but without offending it by presenting an objectively superior car.</p><p>No sooner had I arrived than things began to get strange. Bolts of bright purple electricity danced along the telegraph lines that once served in-car speakers, pausing temporarily to roll across the rain puddles accumulating in the cracked tarmac. At once it was there, and I felt myself growing small as it studied me from afar, its engine idling with an unearthly whistling howl several octaves above the normal X-pipe-with-glasspacks cry of many a Saturday night hero.</p><p>What did the Trans Am see when it looked in my soul? After the events that transpired, I now know it had to be a desire - no, <i>longing</i> - for cheap beaters. It half-beckoned, half-pulled me to a buy-here-pay-here lot and together we decimated a row of German luxury cars, isolating each one and smashing their bodies into pulp. With each strike, the Trans Am’s panels would momentarily distort before returning to their natural glory, the bronze firechicken on the hood seeming to dance with joy as the BMWs falling victim to its virtuous hatred became unrecognizable.</p><p>The Trans Am and I whooped in synchronous glee as we laid patch after patch on our way to the centre of town. Above the targa tops, I could see a new day was just beginning. What happened at that Cars &amp; Coffee is known to all who survived the day’s events. That set did not include my benefactors, whose Italian exotics and luxobarge Bentleys were sent to China for recycling as small steel cubes with the owners trapped inextricably within.</p><p>As for me? One morning I bought a sixteen-valve Scirocco Mk2, a really mint car. It just needed a little bit of work. The Trans Am drove me to the pickup, and then departed at high speed, finally pleased at putting me back on the straight and narrow of shit car rescue. I would never see it again after that day, which was just as well, because the Trans Am didn’t really have enough cargo room for all the 020s I was going through.</p>

<H1>My Neighbour Nitrous Toro</H1>
<p>I was but a young child when I first met my neighbour Nitrous Toro. He promised a magical foreign land occupied entirely by chemical-supercharged lawn maintenance implements. In return, all I had to do was wish hard enough and also dig around in the back of his shed for the right jet size for the dicky Tecumseh rods to accept the life-giving gift of more air than air.</p><p>I never forgot about Nitrous Toro when I became a hollowed-out emulation of a functional human being, attending scrum meetings and complaining about income taxes. But I found it very difficult to keep my mouth shut one fateful morning in front of the office coffeemaker, when my new coworker (”Victim E,” in the attached documentation) changed the subject to lawncare. Even as my other coworkers, who had long suspected my tendencies but were unable to act upon them due to a then-lack of positive external confirmation by an authority figure, shielded their faces protectively and slunk away into the corners of the room, he continued to speak:</p><p>&ldquo;I have a great lawn, and I can mow it so quickly. I’ve got one of those new zero-turn <i>electric mowers</i>.”<br/></p><p>An electric mower. My pupils dilated and my heart rate raced like an RX7 with a stuck throttle on a hot day next to a particularly farty oil refinery. I could feel the pinpricks on my rapidly-whitening skin, indicators that the Voice - the <i>Other</i> - wanted to use my corporeal body as a portal to this world, to wreak his great havoc.</p><p>When it was all over, I stood alone over a burning lawn. Only the sound of a nitrous solenoid clack-clacking as my gas-pedal foot instinctively went WOT and then full slack, over and over in a nervous twitch, could be heard. I don’t know how long I stayed there, but I do know that my neighbour appeared. It had been decades since I had seen him last, but somehow he had not aged. He outstretched his hand to grasp mine.</p><p>“You mowed the <i>hell</i> out of that thing,” he said, “but that Craftsman shit can’t take a 65-shot like that for an entire lawn. Come with me.”<br/></p><p>I followed him, and although we walked a great distance, I did not - could not - feel tired. At last we arrived at the shed of my childhood memories, and my neighbour Nitrous Toro opened the door and gestured within.</p><p>On the floor sat the Tecumseh I had first infused with the corrupting force of squeeze. How it had not oxidized in the years since I had last seen it, I could not comprehend.</p><p>“You see?” he said, “These piston crowns are the <i>best</i>.”<br/></p><p>Without breaking stride, he entered, grasped the Tecumseh, and slammed it into the frame of the ride-on Toro sitting next to his shed. Something felt right, and the universe began to tilt back towards its natural equilibrium. This was what I was meant to do.</p><p>That night, before the police officers would come, I was sitting in my back yard, researching tire compounds for the Toro. Although the progressive controller had tried valiantly in my test pulls, it would always blow away anything less than an R-compound when it came on the bottle. I looked up from the catalogue to find the neighbour’s teenage kid, confused at the sight of seeing an adult male performing his own maintenance on a mechanical object.</p><p>“What’s that huge purple bottle for?” he asked, his eyes wide with fright.<br/></p><p>“Not for Craftsman mowers, I’ll tell you that much.”<br/></p>

<H1>Guest Post</H1>
<p>The ceiling tiles briefly pulled my attention away from Gerald as he droned on about his big weekend plans.  Hunting down unmutated juveniles for their internal organs wasn’t exactly my glass of Zima but I try not to judge my coworkers too harshly, it’s a dog-eat-phasewolf world out there and we all have to do what we all have to do.  In the corner of my eye I caught sight of a red dress sashaying down the hallway just long enough to bring me out of my internal reverie, Gerald and I both spotted the clock on wall as she slipped past the end of the corridor.  4:30.  Time to hit the highway and start our all-too-short two day break from the radioactive rat race.</p><p>The underground parking bunker came alive with the angry rumbling of 7.2 liter displacement road combat vehicles.  I was immediately reminded of last summer’s poweryacht regatta out in the bay, hopefully the virus-slime levels were low enough to hold it again next year, the social luncheon was always a highlight of the year.</p><p>I pointed my war machine’s nose to the east and home.  The Thunderroad howled under my tires as I chewed up the distance with their meaty siping.  The smoking wreckage from this morning’s rush hour had been nearly picked clean by the scavs, I had to be careful now, they like to set traps if they didn’t get enough to fill their shopping carts from the wrecks.  I tightened the cardigan sleeves knotted around my chest and said a silent prayer.</p><p>The trip was mercifully uneventful and I drifted perfectly around the corner and into the community gates.  As I powerslid into the cul-de-sac where my 1960’s stucco castle dream house lay, I had to swerve suddenly.  The Johnson kid, little Susie, was out drawing on the asphalt with some contraband road chalk she picked up from somewhere.</p><p>Shit.  The HOA was going to flense us alive if she didn’t clean that up before darkness hit.</p>

<p>For years, people - salesmen, court-appointed psychiatrists, the Illuminati - had been trying to get me inside a luxury car. I disdained their lack of work ethic, their desire to have a non-numb ass after hours in the seat, their disconnection from the road - from <i>driver agency</i> - in favour of letting some unaccountable, intractable machine make their decisions for them. But then I got upgraded on a rental car.</p><p>The 2016 Hyundai Sonata, let me tell you, <i>that’s</i> a luxury car. Rear heated seats, seatbelts that retract automatically, two headlights, a <i>headliner</i>. I’m told by those “in the know” that it also has a radio, though it wasn’t like you could have heard it over my excited gibbering at the crack-free windshield. I drove it all the way to the jobsite and it didn’t catch fire even once.</p><p>In fact, I’m so excited about my discovery of luxury cars that I’ve purchased a 2003 Merc S550 from a buy-here-pay-here lot. I’ll just deal with things as they break, and slowly replace them with junkyard Cavalier parts. Say, did you know that this thing has <i>power windows on almost all four doors</i>?</p>

<p>Sometimes people want to know what I would change to make everything better. I guess this is because of my everyman countenance, which is considered non-threatening to police officers, bar attendants and local politicians. When they ask me, I furrow my brow in the practiced expression of a Serious Small Business Owner, and I let them have it.</p><p>What I would change is to make all the we-pull-it junkyards actually respond to internet inquiries. You see, a lot of these shops are pretty old-school. They’re run by boomers or whatever came before boomers. You have to pick up your phone - and get this, you have to <i>use the “Phone” app on your phone</i> - to ask a living human being a question. That’s total bullshit!</p><p>Here’s how most conversations go:</p><p><b>Switch</b>: Hey girl what you got in that yard<br/><b>Junkyard Empress</b>: We just got a fresh batch of Toyotas in.<br/><b>Switch</b>: You better let me take some of those rank-ass Toyota Celicas off your hands. I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a crusher.<br/><b>Junkyard Empress</b>: You sound familiar. Aren’t you the guy who jumped over the fence to steal those Rockwell rear-steers from our lifted limousine last week?<br/><b>Switch</b>: (click)</p><p>So as you can see, I think it’s time for a new strategy. A <i>disruptive</i> strategy. I am speaking, of course, of parts delivery. Imagine a world where this is possible.</p><p><b>Switch</b>: Holy shit I need a front left speaker for a 1990 Toyota Celica GT-S <i>(types into phone)</i><br/><b>Underpaid, Largely Uninsured Lower-Class Worker With No Benefits</b>: <i>(pulls up to curb in a haze of tire smoke)</i> Here you go, boss.<br/><b>Switch</b>: Ten minutes to get this all the way across town? Three stars.<br/><b>Underpaid, Largely Uninsured Lower-Class Worker With No Benefits</b>: <i>(starves quietly)</i><br/></p><p>It is for this reason that I believe city council should ignore, and in fact <i>legalize</i>, my contractors’ breaking of speed limits to and from junkyards.</p>

<p> My partner’s lips pulled at the plastic coffee-cup lid like a starving baby goat on a teat. We had caught a double, and the stress of the job and his disintegrating marriage weren’t helping matters any. I would have said something, but there’s advice even partners won’t give one another and most of it involves chemical dependency. I was just happy he was off the expensive stuff: Evapo-Rust wasn’t cheap and neither were all the nitrile gloves he liked to use when he would come by my garage for a session of weekend wrenching.</p><p>One of those gloves held a piece of wiring harness aloft now, dangling on the end of my partner’s always-present tire shop promotional ballpoint pens. His brow furrowed, and I knew he was having trouble placing it. I had to chuckle as I knelt down myself, a conspiratorial expression on my face.</p><p>“You know what that is, don’t you?” I asked. Of course he didn’t.</p><p>“Of course I don’t,” he said, “It looks old. European.”</p><p>“You’re right. It’s Volvo. Biodegradable, from before the war.”</p><p>That little piece of information was all it took to get a big reaction. I could see him firing on all cylinders now, first metaphorically then physically as our detective’s-issue Crown Vic rolled out with him behind the wheel. Normally, I would never let him drive, but I had also had a long night and figured I could catch a nap on the way in between the shrieks of sheer terror as the rookie went pedestrian-hunting with the big-body Ford in the bad part of town.</p><p>Spoiler alert: almost the entire city is “the bad part of town.” Where other cities have the wrong side of the tracks, our crime rate was so bad the railroad didn’t even show up until the government forced them. You ever seen a teenager steal the wheels off a <i>diesel locomotive</i> before? I have.</p><p>Ballard beckoned, and we answered the call. I left a handwritten note beneath the wipers of the Vic, explaining to the meter maid that my partner had parked across the sidewalk not because of laziness but because of <i>essential police business</i>. They always fell for that shit: try it yourself next time you leave your car with one wheel on a fire hydrant.</p><p>Ingemar knew we were coming. He was so resolved to his fate that after returning the Volvo 245 to his shop, instead of repairing the hit and run damage, he prepared a bribe for us. All the bodywork we could ever want done, no problem officers, you want candy paint?</p><p>Giving serious consideration to the offer in front of the rookie would be at the very least in poor taste. Ingemar was apoplectic, a frothing rage at the concept that we wouldn’t necessarily want our project cars to have nice fresh paint.</p><p>“You think going fast for cheap is all life is?” Ingemar shrieked after the Hotside bounced his head off the C-pillar of the Vic while pushing him into the back seat. “I have <i>car show trophies</i>! You fuckers can’t do this to me!”</p><p>The Mayor had a medal for both of us, the brave detectives who had solved the crime spree of the Volvo Killer. When the TV news interviewed us, I couldn’t help but notice the glitz and glamour of flashbulbs had begun to turn the Hotside’s eye from the straight and narrow. Above all the distractions that concerned me, paramount was one pretty little news reporter, who asked him question after question about which Nissan to buy.</p><p>Even then, I could sense the rookie was slipping away from me. No man-to-man conversation in a detective’s car could stop it now, and I braced myself for the impact like a Takata airbag owner in a Walmart parking lot.</p>

<p>Truth be told, it wasn’t that big of a leap to go from a monthly magazine about bad cars to running a Battlebots team. I certainly had enough left-over rusty steel, welding experience and $800 Princess Auto minimills of forged Chinesium. When the junior editorial staff pitched me the idea, I jumped in with both feet and didn’t stop stomping until I felt its bones splinter beneath my toes. Don’t let anyone ever tell you I’m not a supportive boss. I’m the <i>obsessive</i> boss.</p><p>Our entry - Little Shitty, though the name got Bowdlerized for TV - only cost about fifty bucks to put forward, which the organizers found surprising. Everyone else’s cost at least ten grand, they said, their eyebrows raised. I guess I just found a lot of stuff lying around the shop, you know how it is when you run an engineering organization. Failing to find anything specifically forbidden by the regulations, they let a giraffe play football.</p><p>My first duel was also my last one. The Intimidator, a perfect gleaming carapace of carbon fiber and buzzsaws, spun itself across the stage and slammed into our humble combat robot with as much force as it could muster. I sucked breath through my teeth as Little Shitty got a buzzsaw smack into the jaw. But I had already won, and let me tell you how.</p><p>So this is the thing. Nothing in Battlebots says you can’t enter a robot made entirely out of fine machining swarf with a thirty-five-dollar RC car underneath.</p><p>As the spinning saw bit into the expanding-foam armour of my robot, I yelled across the arena: “HOPE YOU POTTED YOUR TRACES, MOTHERFUCKERS!”</p><p>A glistening cloud of metal fragments filled the arena then, like an android pinata filled with cybernetic mustard gas and fed into a garbage disposal. I wish you could have seen the facial expression on the opposing team captain as it shifted from delight to purestrain horror.</p><p>The resulting flame-out of my rival as thousands of microscopic particles of only the finest CNC shrapnel bridged capacitor legs, arced the solder of thick-gauge wiring connectors and gummed up gearboxes via their exposed breathers was second only to the explosion at the team meetings afterward. Shutting down an arena for the entire day meant I was the de facto winner, I maintain, even after I lost the fistfight to the Intimidator team captain after he sought me out in the pits.</p>

<p>I called the Toyota dealership to ask them about a warranty extension on my Corona’s seatbelts. Surely they wanted to protect me from such dangers as frayed webbing and worn retractor springs, I imagined. The line went silent, and was replaced by hold music. Perhaps they were checking with TOYOTA SAFETY-CHAN, the animate spirit embodying the new determination of Toyota Corporate to protect its family of customers.</p><p>Some scratching on the line, and then a different voice, as if from far away, <i>sotto voce</i>: “Please hold for TOYOTA SAFETY-CHAN.” This was it, it is happening. They are hooking me up with the big cheese. I caught myself beginning to hyperventilate out of pure anticipation for meeting the supernatural entity that had forcibly manifested itself in the centre of Toyota City during a winter-floormats scandal. They said the fires it left behind could not be extinguished by mortal men and burned even today, but that it had an eerie power to gift wishes of consumer safety.</p><p>The line connected. I held my breath, stone silent in fear. My forehead began to bead with sweat.</p><p>“YOU <i>DARE</i> CONSULT TOYOTA SAFETY-CHAN WITH AN OUT OF WARRANTY TOYOTA?”<br/></p><p>This was not how I expected this to go at all. Not at all! I began to voice my objections, but was shut down by a booming commandment so sharp it strained my phone’s voice compression algorithms.</p><p>“FOR YOUR INSOLENCE I WILL FORCE YOUR THROTTLE TO CUT OUT WHEN YOU TOUCH THE BRAKES. LEFT FOOT BRAKING IN FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE PERFORMANCE CARS WILL BE LOST TO YOU FOREVERMORE.”<br/></p><p>No! <i>No</i>! All I wanted was some free seatbelts! I was panicking now, near frenzy, barely able to comprehend what the voice was saying.</p><p>“TRAIL BRAKING AND LEFT FOOT BRAKING ARE INHERENTLY UNSAFE. YOU WILL BE SAFE. TOYOTA SAFETY-CHAN HAS DEMANDED IT.”<br/></p><p>The line went dead. In the garage, I could hear rustling. I barged in, Streamlight in hand. Swinging the Streamlight furiously into thin air, I scared away the harem of Toyota mechanics swarming over every inch of my Corona. They bolted into the night, leaving behind traction-control ECUs and pamphlets on how to safely use my sun visors.</p><p>Although I didn’t know it at the time, I had made a truly powerful enemy. The Toyota mechanics would return, striving to try and make me safe lest their corporeal forms be recycled into those more useful to Toyota Safety-Chan. If I had been more attuned, I could have heard the psychic screams of inarticulate rage from Toyota City even then.</p>

Tonight on <i>End Stage Capitalism Masterpiece Theatre</i>: the Mazda RX-7. How did the the conspicuous consumption of Tony Stark&rsquo;s very own spinning-dorito magic carpet turn into an actually decent sports car? Our Japanese correspondent intervened in a Hiroshima hostage negotiation to find out.</p><p>Koshiro-<i>san</i>, where are you now?</p><p>Hello, yes, I am coming to you live from outside the Mazda engine development facility. Very secure, but they had a big hole in the fence I could climb through.</p><p>I understand there’s some kind of commotion inside the factory?</p><p>Yes, from what I am hearing one of the engineers has barricaded himself inside his office and refuses to come out until the next-generation rotary engine is approved for production. We are telling him lies to see if he will emerge. What? <i>(rustling sound)</i> No, these are true facts. They just put out a press release, it will be part of an all-new RX-7 in 2019!</p><p>Koshiro-<i>san</i>, can you tell us anything more about the engineer’s mood?</p><p>It’s low, Ted. Very low. He is trying to show me a crude diagram he has sketched on graph paper. I think he is claiming reduced pumping losses from a combination of a specialized intake plenum and nickel-plated ovoid valve shroud that encourages consistently-sized intake charges, very fascinating. I am humouring him.</p><p>Koshiro, my name is not Ted. We work together in the same office, I see you every morning in front of the coffee maker and we talk about our weekend plans.</p><p>Ah, I am sorry Tim. I don’t know if you can hear this, but the engineer has procured a prototype version of the engine. He says that Mazda Corporate tried to stop him from releasing it by sabotaging his files, but he has figured out how to replace the seals that - I don’t know if this is a <i>dialect</i>, but - he says that the seals keep the Dark Lord Oilmetering-Pumppe from returning to our plane of existence? Tim, I’m scared, tell my wife I l-</p><p>Uh, we’ve lost our satellite uplink to Japan. We’ll catch up with Koshiro and his wacky car antics later in the program.</p>

<p>When the call came up on the big board, I knew we had caught a whopper. My partner and I, a rookie who in those times was nicknamed The Scarlet Hotside, were sent to the bad side of the tracks for a wellness check. Seems an old man had all but disappeared, and his loved ones were curious as to what had happened.</p><p>The first thing you do on a wellness check is try to find the guy before kicking in anything. Looking in his windows and T-ray-scanning the house (technically, bombarding a house with high-frequency waves to identify things inside it did not qualify as unreasonable search and seizure - thanks again, Supreme Court) turned up bupkis.</p><p>Once you’ve passed the pre-kicking-things-in stage, basic logic dictates that the next stage must be kicking things in. After picking myself up from a series of failed flying-tiger kick, I sent the rookie in. He knocked down the back door on the first try, but I’m pretty sure I softened it up for him. Back to back, we scanned the house’s entryway for possible threats, and continued onward.</p><p>I always gravitate towards the garage - call me morbid, but I’d like to know when a nice double oversize near the office opens up - and here I found nothing but the unspectacular. An out-of-warranty Camry, some recycling that was waiting for the curb. The usual kind of thing you’d find in a house. That’s when I heard the rookie’s call. Sighing, I warily headed in the general direction of his cries.</p><p>The homeowner lay at the front door, crushed beneath a pile of envelopes. I knew immediately what we were dealing with.</p><p>“Oil change reminders,” I said to my partner, who looked confused.<br/></p><p>“These people, they get on the dealership’s mailing list. Maybe the dealership runs into a little trouble, maybe the principal has a few bets that he needs to cover. They push the out-of-warranty service harder and harder.”<br/></p><p>I looked at the corpse, envelopes piled atop the atrophied chest. In his advanced age, he simply didn’t have the muscle to push off the letters before they buried him.</p><p>“Looks like he bought parts from a few different dealers,” my partner mentioned. Always angling for the detective’s badge, this guy. “Hell of a way to go.”</p><p>As we were leaving, we passed the mailman. He waved at us, a gleaming smile that could only come from seeing a fellow civil servant in uniform. I would never tell him the truth. It would destroy him to know what Big Oil Change had used him for.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, patriotism is just a sheet thrown over the traditional arts of larceny and fraud. Scratch a nationalist and you’ll find a thief. But I am both: believe me when I tell you that I am a born and bred Canadian, and will remain so forever. Just keep your wallets away from me, because I have a true tale of grand theft to tell you on this Canada Day.</p><p>The year was 2012. My hands were clutching the thin vinyl-imitation steering wheel of a thoroughly blown-out 9C1 Caprice, strategically rusted by years of vicious Quebecois weather and even angrier Quebecois drivers. Traditionally, I worked solo, but our wealthy benefactor, Mr. Cho - always <i>mister</i> with him, always - had arranged for the best of the best of the operator community to partner with me. I was the driver, which makes sense unless you’ve seen me on a golf course.</p><p>My partner, M. Vert, was some kind of locksmith, probably hired to crack the vault on our target. I’ll introduce the other players as they become relevant, but before we continue it’s important that you understand that M. Vert and I had a history. That history dated back to a flawed Kijiji deal on the banks of the beautiful Richelieu, beneath a featureless grey sky. It all worked out in the end, but that’s another story. Since that ill-fated control arm exchange, we had kept in contact, and neither of us particularly trusted Mr. Cho.</p><p>I don’t know to this day what the others thought, and we didn’t speak to them much. It wasn’t professional to use our real names - I was M. Gris - lest the 

Sûreté figured out what we were up to that morning in the warehouse district of Saint-Louis-de-Blandford. The radio squawked with M. Marron’s voice and we were ready to go. I idled the Caprice into the parking lot, meeting up with the International dump truck we had chosen for the heist. With a quick flourish, I popped the trunk of the big-body Chevrolet, exposing gleaming nitrous tanks and cutting tools. Without breaking pace, M. Vert opened the Caprice’s huge passenger side door, grabbed the oxy-ace cutter and tore the lock out of the immense double-armoured warehouse doors.</p><p>My butt was just beginning to break in the International’s front bench seat when the radio squawked again. M. Marron had me back up to the loading dock, and we began piling barrel upon barrel of filthy lucre into the cargo truck’s copious bed. I kept my head on a swivel, knowing that whatever M. Jaune missed from his sniper perch on a neighboring roof would rapidly become my problem in the slower-moving truck.</p><p>It was almost too easy, really. We made the dropoff after travelling through downtown Blandford uninterrupted, unquestioned, in broad daylight. Mr. Cho would be pleased. Dispersing into rush hour traffic, it seemed unlikely that anyone could catch us.</p><p>But there had been a mole in our operation all along. In time, and through the endless machinations of court, we would find that M. Rose had been hired by the RCMP to keep an eye on Mr. Cho’s many activities and sniffed out the great maple syrup heist with only minor assistance. I was hauled in, questioned as part of the usual suspects, but released after playing dumb. I had to chuckle when they found the Caprice in the woods, the VINs thermited off, and determined it could not have been me driving because of the lack of camber wear on its front tires. Cho had definitely done his homework, and I was glad I hadn’t cancelled that appointment at the alignment shop he booked for me.</p><p>M. Vert was cooling his heels in Archambault as he awaited trial. Unprofessional as it was, I felt it was wrong to let him take the fall for the team’s actions, and made a trip that spring to speed up his rehabilitation and paroling. After all, you can’t trust the government to move as quickly as a twin-turbocharged stadium-truck Suzuki Samurai with a hydraulic battering ram for a bumper.</p>

<p>It was a crisp fall evening at my sprawling New England compound, the leaves falling upon the sea of $650 Bronco IIs that I parked out back as a windbreak. I had just finished re-reading one of my favourite science-fiction books, <i>The Subaru That Didn’t Burn Oil</i>, by Blown H.G. Wells. The combination of grain alcohol and the recently completed literary work allowed me to slip into an easy, relaxed mood, and I became contemplative.</p><p>Maybe there was something more to life than just wrenching on an endless procession of beaters. Perhaps, I thought now as I did in my weaker hours, cars were meant to be driven to places to do things <i>other</i> than driving and wrenching. But such concepts were obsolete in today’s age of the internet and whisper-quiet six-rotor VTOL hunter-killer grocery delivery drones. My eyes drifted to the west, where the field of Broncos gave way to a relaxing wave of flame-spewing EJ22-engined dune buggies.</p><p>My contemplation was interrupted by the gentle sound of subway-arrival chimes from downstairs. What else could it have been but my weekly RockAuto order arriving? Clutching my carbon-fibre survival hatchet close to my chest, I descended the lucite spiral stairwell to my front door.</p><p>What I saw before me could not be struck down with any mere hatchet. Indeed, the sight chilled me to my bones. There could be no redemption, I began to realize. No amount of reparations could take this ghastly spectre from my forecourt.</p><p>Before me laid a Triumph Dolomite, perfectly restored, an immaculate wax job shining light across its flawless tinwork. Were there limits to my desire to preserve awful cars for future generations? Even cars I hated deserved survival, I had carelessly boasted, before my hubris was made real.</p>

<p>When I pulled that old Range Rover out of a Congolese river, my travelling companion Sideways Sue laughed. There’s no way I could get that piece of shit to do anything other than rust and catch fire, she said, and she returned to her reliable and well-outfitted Land Cruiser. At last the Classic whale beached itself on the pea-gravel shore, my prerunner Ranger’s carbon-fiber overfenders jiggling as the winch came to a sudden stop.</p><p>Years passed, and with every passing month the Range Rover did indeed sink further and further into my yard, a testament to the true powers of inertia. My loved ones were starting to become concerned: had I become one of those insane old hicks who covets his neat rows of grass-filled beaters as they return to earth, swearing that one day all of them will be restored to pristine Barrett-Jackson glory? I determined it was time to do something, and the first order of business was to cut my 40-hour-a-week job to a more manageable schedule.</p><p>Two burnouts and one SAE-standard donut later, I had successfully reduced my schedule to zero. I bet my boss is still trying to scrape the re-vulcanized rubber marbles off the quarter panel of his GLA. I returned to my humble compound and began the laborious task of getting the Range Rover to roll again. Images of its potential flickered through my mind, interrupted only periodically by furious shovelling every time the power-assisted come-along again mired the immense British shitbox in the mud.</p><p>When it came to motive power, I looked through my shed for something that would be appropriate. In the corner, long-abandoned, attached via seatbelts to a cobwebbed engine crane, I would at last find my muse. The Strange Rover was born that day, motivated by an old OM617 that I would in short order push enough nitrous through to make the abstract engineering concept of volumetric efficiency largely irrelevant.</p><p>A lot of people at Cars and Coffee thought it was a little weird that I would take a luxury overland SUV and equip it with a growling, cussing iron-block engine that consumed extremely-non-bio-diesel like a refinery fire, but like Sidney Rigdon had always said, for every bad idea there was always a coterie of true believers to worship at its altar. Even before the regular Mustang pedestrian collisions had begun, I already saw the Strange Rover surrounded by crowds of eager idiots, grinning from ear to ear as they ingested suffocating clouds of still-flaming diesel particulate from its headlight-mounted exhaust outlet.</p><p>I could see Sideways Sue stood behind the crowd, frowning, as her immaculate Land Cruiser looked boring in comparison to the steam-engine-from-hell that I had forged from the garbage lying around my yard. She had the last laugh, however, as on the way home the Rover’s driveshaft decided it no longer wanted to be part of the European Union I had constructed and instead fucked off to a ditch somewhere to die.</p>

<p>I was an LBC anthropologist, dedicated to visiting boomers in their retirement home and capturing the best of their knowledge about Triumph GT6s, Austin-Healys, Reliant Rialtos and yes, in the end, even the MGB, before that knowledge could pass into the next world, lost to us forevermore.</p><p>To gain their trust, I would appear in an immaculate, well-restored Triumph Spitfire, but i would never show them what laid under the hood. &ldquo;Twin carbs,&rdquo; I said, and then conspiratorially, &ldquo;Weber DCOEs.&rdquo;</p><p>If they ever looked, they would realize my betrayal immediately. Where they expected to see last century&rsquo;s innovations in exploding fuel technology, they would instead bear witness to a turbocharger so immense that I feared driving in playground zones lest it ingest a preschooler whole. It wouldn’t be incorrect to say that the billet impeller was the true heart of the engine, pushing enough compressed air to make a dive shop jealous.</p><p>Behind and around the turbocharger was the whirling, angry vortex of an SR20VE, infused with long-rod screamo power from SR16 rods. The headwork only made a beautiful combination better; imagine if you will a pair of wide-overlap turbo cams bursting with obscenely bulbous lobes as long as your pinky finger, speaking through ports so clean and straight that the curvature of the earth beneath your feet was made obvious by comparison. This Zen garden of airflow let the mill oscillate between profane bursts of torque-filled rage and harsh, pining wails when its keg-sized turbo slowed, a momentary victim of the otto cycle’s capricious whims.</p><p>When this baby was on tap, the Spitfire lived up to its name, sharp machine-gun bursts searing your retinas as the twin fuel rails pushed gobs of nitromethane to their explosive demise, flames dragged across the two or three lanes the small car’s rear axle liked to walk between when it was really pushing. It changed men to witness it: i was noticing a definite uptick in my day-job business, once-civilians now drafted into the battle between horsepower and homeownership, ready to die on the interstate battlefield, their dead hands still clutching my weapons like a favourite child.<br/></p><p>But I digress from my story; such a thing always happens when I fixate on the howling icon of rage in the corner of my life that makes tire engineers stay up at night. I arrived at the Shady Pines Retirement Co-Operative and pulled into the parking spot a little hot. I knew it was a mistake as soon as I released the clutch, but I had been made. White hair began popping up from behind fences; I had exposed myself, I was no longer a <i>purist</i>. I was a hot-rodder. This was certainly not the kind of boomer I had wished to attract, but perhaps I had been deluding myself to think that the subjects of my anthropology could escape noticing the 16 inch wide Hoosiers out back.</p><p>I had barely had a chance to knock on the door of my quarry’s residence when I came face to face with a double barreled shotgun.</p><p>“The Japs are back,” he screamed at me, despite not being alive for the period during which “The Japs” menaced American infantry. “And they’re taking our roadsters!”<br/></p>

<p>Have you ever wondered where all of the weird little cars that clowns drive go to once they’re no longer roadworthy?</p><p>It turns out way back in the 1970s there was only one manufacturer of clown cars, and when they went out of business the aftermarket parts business basically never saw the point in keeping it going. That’s where I came in.</p><p>As regular readers of my writing may know, in the 1980s I briefly worked as a career counsellor for the local clown college. In many cases, I would see someone who had interned as a clown, but perhaps wanted to change into juggling or jestership now that they had a taste of the real world. They’d ask me if I knew anywhere to get rid of their old clown car, now that they no longer needed it.</p><p>Eventually, I became known as the guy with hundreds of very tiny cars stacked in his backyard, and professional clowns would drop by unannounced to see if they could score miniature carburetors or control arms. In fact, the control arms were a pretty quick seller, as suspension bushings in the original designs would frequently wear out under the weight of an entire thirty-clown coterie. Before long, I was pressing in new spherical bushings and engineering my own control arms. It was then that I fell down a dark hole, never to emerge.</p><p>While at a party, I ran into a fellow mechanic. He worked on Legends cars, those miniature racecars powered by increasingly-ridiculous sportbike power. But he had a problem. Shriners needed something with some guts, but all of the Legends cars looked unappealingly like race cars. After hearing his lamentations, I grinned ear to ear, and I saw not for the first time the mist of fear clouding his eyes.</p><p>So yes, officers, that’s pretty much what happened to the Labour Day Parade. Yes, I know that a nitrous-chugging sportbike motor was probably a little more power than is expressly allowed by “the insurance companies,” whoever those are. But I ask you: can you blame me for wanting to see a clown go <i>really, really fast</i>?</p>

<p>You may have heard in local news outlets that I wasn’t invited back to any Corvette Club of America autocross events. But there’s a lot of rumours floating around about that. In an ongoing effort to clear up the cloud of fear that clings to stories of my on-track achievements, I have adopted a policy of radical transparency.</p><p>Documents will show that a few months ago, I purchased a 1989 Corvette from a police auction. Now I know what you’re going to say, and you can cap it right now: it wasn’t a drug dealer’s car. It was a drug <i>consumer’s</i> car. I was over the moon at the chance to own my very own C4, and the remarkable torque in basically every gear of the 6-speed gave me fond recollections of my trusty-but-rusty GMC K2500 Stepside, which occupied the other bay of the garage in my humble estate.</p><p>It was that Stepside that led me down this dark path.</p><p>One morning, I had to make a dump run. You know how these things go: every room of the house accumulates a thin layer of empty spray paint cans, spent rotors, shattered differential housings. I had just finished loading the bed of the Stepside and went to turn the key when - nothing. The battery was dead.</p><p>Grinning, I relished the excuse to take the C4 to the parts store, where new batteries grew on the shelves like the lethal coconut bounty of palm trees. But I had barely gotten to the end of the driveway when I realized I might as well just drive my new Corvette everywhere. After all, what’s the point in having it if you can’t do a burnout to impress the girl working the scrap-metal scale at the dump entrance?</p><p>Weeks later, I no longer required the Stepside at all. A sawzall and some tactical visits to a going-out-of-business heavy hauling shop gave me the Towvette. I peeled the trunk free, welding a fifth-wheel mount between the frame rails. Extra leafs were added to the carbon-fibre monoleaf to keep it from bottoming out when I threw trackday supplies and emptied bottles of nitrous oxide into the newly-formed bed.</p><p>But the crowning achievement, and what got me kicked out of the autocross, was the set of custom-made Hoosiers, mounted four wide on gleaming Alcoa dually wheels. Naturally, a luscious fibreglass stepside widebody covered the tires, for safety purposes of course. It turns out this was a brilliant choice: not only did the Hoosiers grip better from the strange interaction of sidewall-to-sidewall groping, but they also made the Corvette stable enough that I could easily make up the time I lost while flattening cone gates now too narrow for my frame.</p><p>I knew I had cheated, but I didn’t realize quite how badly until the timing van - oh wow, I could make a <i>C4 Vanette</i> next - started flashing its “FTD” siren, above the occupants now swearing so loudly at my times that you could visually identify individual syllables from the flexing of the windows.</p><p>Now that I’ve cleared that up, it’s time to move onto the other persistent rumour: that Zora Arkus-Duntov is frozen cryogenically beneath Bowling Green, awaiting a car builder who can bring his vision to life. This one is true, and although Car and Driver believes it to be <i>only</i> mid-engined, they join my fellow competitors in sorely underestimating me.</p>

<p>Thank you for purchasing your new Jeep Grand Cherokee product. We here at Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCA) would like to be the first to congratulate you on your choice of a reliable, comfortable, and exciting vehicle. Please read on to familiarize yourself with the basic operation of your vehicle before driving, and return to this manual for refreshers as needed.</p><p><b>BASIC OPERATION - TRANSMISSION</b></p><p>Your Jeep Grand Cherokee is equipped with a highly advanced eight-speed automatic transmission, delivered to us each night by unaccountable, anonymous elves that appear in our transmission shop when nobody is looking. Its mode of operation may be different from other vehicles you have operated in the past, and it is for this reason that Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCA) disclaims all responsibility for accidents.</p><p><b>Shifting to Drive</b></p><p>To change the transmission from its default “inert” mode into a “forward motion” mode, depress the second-from-left shoulder trigger (marked as L2 on the accompanying quick-reference sheet) and move the shift selection protrusion into “R,” which stands for “Really, It’s In Drive.”</p><p>Once the shifter has been moved, and “R” appears on the full-colour dashboard-mounted hyper-information terminal display, release the second-from-left shoulder trigger while depressing the dashboard-mounted “X” button with your opposing thumb to lock in the shift selection.</p><p>If the vehicle shifts to neutral (indicated by “P” on the terminal display) instead, redo the operation, paying special attention to the timing of your movements. Do not roll down the windows while selecting gear, as this will activate the anti-carjacking mechanism and set the self-drive manifold operation mode to “strange.”</p><p><b>Parking the Vehicle</b></p><p>In order to park the vehicle, first use the ellipsoid navigational-suggestive tiller located on the dashboard to steer the vehicle into an appropriate parking space. At this time, you should depress the Render-Inert pedal, the leftmost (unless your pedal order has been changed in the System Configuration control panel) pedal, with your foot in order to render the vehicle temporarily inert.</p><p>Once the vehicle has become immobile, depress the far left trigger (L1 on the Quick Reference card) and the far right trigger (”H” on the Quick Reference card), and in one quick motion, move the shift selector protrusion as far towards the rear of the car as possible. You will hear a whooshing sound, indicating the gear intent detent has been dismounted from the orthogonal rail. Release the far left trigger (L1 on the Quick Reference card) and twist the head of the shift selector protrusion by 90 degrees <i>clockwise only</i>.</p><p>You will know the vehicle has been rendered inert by the appearance of a calendar icon on the shift selection portion of the dashboard-mounted hyper-information terminal display. This indicates that the vehicle is now moving forward on a <i>geological</i> timeframe as opposed to a traditional motive-powered one. You may now turn off the vehicle, and exit it. Other noises may be heard, but these are likely to be the transmission’s turbo encabulator and arise during normal function.</p><p>Please note that turning the shift selector protrusion head fewer or greater than exactly 90 degrees will return the car to neutral. Do not exit the car when this happens or the self-driving sentience module (see page F-23) may identify you as a carjacker.</p>

<p>I drove past a house with a motley collection of ratty Fieros on the front lawn. Although I didn’t know it at the time, my mind was already filing it away in some sort of survivalist hoarding instinct. When the End Times come, it and I surely believed, it will be important to know where to find parts to keep a GM 60 degree V6 on the road.</p><p>Over the following weeks, I found myself driving past the Fiero house more and more. Perhaps it was an inefficient route, but I was learning that it had some nice corners on the way, and it was easy enough to become contemplative, relaxed, and find myself before the home once more. Eventually I decided to get out of the car and take a look on foot. The hatchet from under my dashboard came with me, of course. At the time, I owned three Subarus at once, and game recognize game.</p><p>The door was cracked, its gaps Fiero-wide, as if someone was waiting for me. I lifted my Streamlight into the standard position I had seen a million times before from previous SWAT raids of my property, and entered smoothly, silently, checking my corners and making sure my exits were clear.</p><p>What I found in the Fierohouse eats at me to this very day. Every available surface was covered in Fiero memorabilia, parts, magazines, factory service manuals, multi-page-printouts of forum posts about swaps. Each wall, it seemed, had its own whiteboard with its own interminable to-do list. I stepped softly through the house, and followed a clear path in the litter-stained floor out the back door, its rusted hinges creaking in protest.</p><p>In the back yard, more Fieros. I don’t know what I had expected, and was turning to leave when I caught sight of it. A gazebo, freshly painted, and seemingly untouched. Underneath it, a man dressed only in a white suit was waiting in a rocking chair, with a glass of sweet tea in his right hand. His left was tucked elegantly in one pocket, and the unseen hand made me anxious as I approached.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you,” he said. “You show great promise, and it is finally time to accept your destiny as one of the weird Fiero guys of your neighbourhood.” The left hand swung upward, opened. Inside it was a keyring of 1980s GM keys. A starter set of spores for the disease to start a new colony from.</p><p>“You can take these Fieros today, free. Almost all of them run. The titles are in the glovebox, already signed.”</p><p>I began to sweat. It was tempting, to be sure, but something seemed off about his proposal. Memories of Fiero dashboards flashed into my mind, unbidden. Their horrible ergonomics, the contempt that Pontiac itself - the town, the brand, the mindset - had for the humble working-man such as myself when it considered that I may one day wish to possess a mythical “sports car” to elevate me above commuter-car duty.</p><p>Reeling, I ran flat-out for the protective custody of the waiting Subaru, clambering over a set of rust-free - <i>rust-free, my God</i> - quarter panels to leap over the top of the Fierohouse’s barbed-wire fence. I rolled when I hit the ground; breaking momentum would surely have meant the death of me - and jumped over the Legacy’s frameless-windowed door to start its modest EJ22.</p><p>As I peeled away from the house of horrors, I realized that I was not yet out of the woods. I had neglected to check the garage, had assumed in my hubris none of the Fieros were running.</p><p>In my rear-view mirror, a bright-white ‘88 Fiero Formula emerged, its side-exit exhausts flaring with rage.</p>

<p>“DRIVE WITH CAR,” the slightly mutilated roadside sign says, a clean bullet hole dead centre of where the missing vowel should be. I will, sign. I <i>will</i>.</p><p>In the spirit of that entreaty, I finished my walk, the Fitbit burbling happily that I had completed another of its rudely interrupting demands of slavemastery, and let myself into my car. A lot of people frown upon the 1988 Pontiac Sunbird Turbo convertible. I did too, but that was before I realized my local Kijiji has some sort of arcane voodoo power, possibly caused by the intersection of ancient ley lines, that endlessly produces them. They all have about 238 thousand kilometers and dead turbochargers, and they all give me about another fifty grand or a dry fifty shot, whichever comes first.</p><p>As I tool past the sign that compelled me to hop in the car in the first place, I think about what the signmaker’s life must have been like. Did he work in some windowless office where the cryptic demands of some pompous bureaucrat filtered through community engagement sessions and middle managers before reading his Outlook inbox? Or did he have a free, unrestricted life where he discovered traffic problems through powerful sentiment analysis algorithms before creating the perfect three-to-five-word road sign that would end a traffic problem forever? What stories did he know? What civil unrest had he fended off, without me even knowing? What signs has he refused to make?</p><p>I knew only of one place to answer these questions, and led the Sunbird onward, my metaphorical spurs pushing the thin-rodded LA5 to spool its ancient turbocharger to overcome its fearful inertia. Before long, I arrived at City Hall, a gentle thirty-shot of nitrous (I confess that I had become impatient on my journey and started pushing flashing red buttons) flaming out of the exhaust. The cloud of goosed hydrocarbons was already setting off nearby airborne-contamination and emissions-violation sensors in the parking lot. A sign nearby lectured me to become a “GOOD AIR CITIZEN,” and the coincidence was not lost on me.</p><p>What could I say but that the mayor was waiting for me? Perhaps the unannounced visit from me every week, the rod bearings clanging sonorously on a wave of juice-infused boost, had made him fall into a routine of sorts. Regardless, he stood behind his massive cherrywood desk, offering me two options.</p><p>I could choose to become an apprentice to the sign guy, he said, with an employment contract in one hand, or I could have a 1987 Pontiac Sunbird Safari - already so rare I began to salivate - with the immense turbocharged six from the Grand Prix ASC McLaren that crashed into a commuter rail station last week.</p><p>The next week, behind the wheel of my transmission- and head-gasket-devouring turbocharged front-drive station wagon, I came across the sign that had begun my quest. It now featured a picture of a cartoon bus driver waving to a car, and read in blue sans-serif text, “THANK YOU FOR YIELDING.”</p>

<p>Burnout Sanders, the automatic burnout-performing robot that campaigned and won the presidency, was busy trying to make the Presidential Seal golf cart leave some elevenses in the White House lawn with three-fifths of a horsepower while I dealt with Syria.<br/></p><p>After the election, the pundit class roared. They claimed that a robot couldn’t be President, but it turns out after closer review of the constitution it didn’t officially forbid it either. We skated into the Oval Office, sweeping the Trump contingent’s payday loan stubs and Gatorade-flavoured vape juice containers strewn about the White House into the dumpster. The only real obstacle we ran into was the Secret Service: they refused to let ol’ Burnie ever drive a car ever again. Needless to say, after several hours of high-pitched existential wailing from the President-elect, they relented and our ratty Trans Am was stored on the White House lawn, its period-correct Radial T/As corded from constant burnouts.</p><p>Burnie got along with everybody. Here’s how it would work: you’d be sitting in your office, setting up some sort of deal with a lobbyist or whatever. Suddenly, a six foot tall gleaming polycarbonate-and-high-boron-steel robot bursts into the room, his amber eyes flickering with joy as he outstretches his hand to grasp yours. You’re gonna want to do whatever this guy wants you to do, and you’re gonna want to do it now. Through his tireless efforts, he unified a divided Congress and passed Roads For America, a wide-ranging Presidential project that would imbue every intersection with VHT traction compound, reducing commute times by up to 17% in major urban areas. The dude knew just how hard to push: it was West Wing as shit.</p><p>Even the foreign service loved him: I remember visiting England with him, and he told the motorcade driver to get out and let him take care of things. You ever seen a three point five ton armoured limousine light up a six minute long smokeshow outside Piccadilly Circus? Neither had the Brits, and they responded by assembling outside Parliament en masse, loudly demanding that their politicians be replaced by stunt-driving androids as well.</p><p>But all was not well. Like many great men, the robot that I built to do burnouts in a hogged-out old F-body had his heart set on a greater prize. I came across him late one night in the halls of the White House, staring out of the window at the moon, his eyes flickering gently as he processed data.</p><p>“You know there’s a car up there, right?”<br/></p><p>He turned to me then, enraptured.</p><p>“Yeah, those NASA guys put up a car with a special kind of tires about sixty years ago. It probably still works.”<br/></p><p>I didn’t think anything of it as I returned to my humble but lovely DC rowhouse. The next morning, I arose to see a CNN breaking news headline: not only had President Sanders singlehandedly whipped both Congress and the Senate into giving NASA an unlimited budget, but that he himself was going to be the first President in space. The talking heads were shocked: why would a burnout-performing robot want to go to the moon?</p><p>It’s been ten years since then. Even now, when I look up at the moon and see perfect clouds of moon dust, I think of the time we shared together and smile. You were too good for this Earth, flawless-burnout-performing robot.</p>

<p>I can hear their cries, their hunger for the greatest vehicle of all time. I am, of course, speaking of the Isuzu Amigo, and I let the leash go slack on mine, barging onto stage in a haze of tire smoke before spiralling into seemingly endless donuts.</p><p>When at last the crescendo of their applause is audible over the sound of the overstrained LQ4 between its frame horns, I loosen my death grip on the gas pedal and kick open the drivers’ door, emerging from the truck as it smokes. They are giving the Isuzu Amigo a standing ovation, and I can see tears rolling down the faces of those in the front row, overjoyed that I have saved their idol from certain doom at the hands of the junkyard crusher.</p><p>A functionary appears from off-stage, hands me a microphone, and disappears into the shadows once more, only slightly wobbling as the still-sizzling tracks of freshly shorn rubber grabs at his soles. I key it up, bring the microphone in close, and address the crowd.</p><p>“Are you ready for Isuzu-Con 2016?” I bark.<br/></p><p>Confused murmurs. The crowd falls silent. I can see in the background some of them are starting to head for the exits.</p><p>As the theatre empties out, I can overhear the conversation between two backwards-hatted men.</p><p>“I <i>told</i> you that guy wasn’t Ken Block,” he said.<br/></p>

<p>It was a pretty straightforward job offer. Part-time work, police department, security screening, that sort of thing. As they were taking my fingerprints, I thought about what I had gotten into and shuddered. I was no snitch, I thought. Me and speeding go together like peanut butter and felony.</p><p>It wasn’t long after they gave me my first job that I could settle my conflicted feelings. An officer would walk into my windowless office, show me a picture of car parts that had been left at the scene of a hit and run, and I would tell them what kind of car it came off of, year, model, colour and probable options packages. At first the detectives were astounded at my prowess, but after awhile they just seemed to accept me as some sort of trim piece Rain Man.</p><p>The truth of the matter is, I only memorized the Volkswagen catalogue. In my first week, I had kept a cellphone on my desk to look up Google Image Search, but it’s not like you needed it when the entire morning was full of pedestrian-involved hit and runs with Mk4 Jettas. By week four, I no longer took the phone out except to look at Snapchats of my friends flipping off differentials.</p><p>Eventually one of the detectives caught on to patterns, that being their entire job and all, and asked me why it was always Volkswagen owners that they were slapping the cuffs onto and roughly abusing with a phonebook to extract confessions from. Didn’t murderous assholes drive any other kind of car?</p><p>“Yes,” I said. “Audis.”</p>

<p>She told me that we would retire to Paris. Years after her, I’m still here. There was just something charming about the city. I was particularly surprised that no books or movies had been dedicated to its romantic appeal. Monuments were erected that nobody knew about, that kind of thing. As for me, I was too busy working, day in and day out, as the lead cartoonist at a small parody magazine.</p><p>My only companion in those heady times was a trusty-but-rusty Renault 4L, its boxlike exterior appealing, beyond all reason, to my artistic temperament. But one day, as our news desk was scanning the local feeds, an interesting story. The Parisian government, under some kind of edict to reduce hydrocarbon emissions, was going to ban old cars from its streets. My Renault would be cast out of the big city, left to die on some farm somewhere.</p><p>Minutes later, I regained consciousness, now several blocks from the office, hugging the 4L with both arms like a soon-departing friend. I couldn’t allow this to happen. I attended every community council meeting, made an ass of myself in front of every politician I could get to answer the phone. Even the local TV news’ troubleshooter programme wasn’t interested. They sneered down at me and my fumbling lack of language skills and told me that there was no way anyone would have sympathy for an old, filthy car with so few God-given horsepower to succeed in life.</p><p>I guess you could say I kicked off the French revolution. Nine thousand of them per minute, to be exact. Visiting a friend of mine who worked in import and export, I secured a modern, highly-emissions-compliant engine from another brand and, over the course of several weeks in my apartment parking paddock, laboured to render it somewhat <i>less</i> compliant. Mechanical tinkering had followed me from North America, and before long, I found my hands guided by years of muscle memory to forge my masterpiece. At last it was done, and I stepped back to admire my work.</p><p>Even at idle, the ever-so-humble F20C’s twincharged induction setup’s ravenous howl of rage could be heard for miles around. Its baguette-sized hood exit exhaust featured an inconel flapper valve that stayed about as still as my now-fluttering heart. Every inch that once was rust was reborn as a gleaming sandwich of structural adhesive and government-subsidized carbon fibre pinched from a Boeing dumpster. Even Cezanne would admit it was a little obsessive.

</p><p>To bring the emissions down, I needed to cool the intake charge just a wee little bit. Was there nothing modern chemistry couldn’t do? When I blipped the gas pedal, it would take ever-so-gentle nips of a ten-pound bottle, like a toddler in training to become a full-blown wino.</p><p>After a quick test flight, I headed directly for the local auto registration department, only to find the employees within cowering beneath their desks, shielding their faces and extremities with whatever they could find. An earthquake was coming, they cried to me, get behind something safe.</p><p>After the large-displacement 4L stopped dieseling in the parking lot and finally returned to its inert torpor, I asked them, with no small hint of malice in my voice, just who it was that performed the emissions tests around here.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Ken. It’s summer time in New England now, the time of year when a young man’s fancy turns to thoughts of small-block pushrod V8s and short-wheelbase conversion vans.</p><p>Just follow me down the hill as we go to the New Yankee Chopshop.</p><p><i>jaunty tune, title card</i></p><p>Well, hello there and welcome to my humble junkyard. Today we’re pulling a Vortec 6000 LQ4, a Chevy small block with big titty high flow heads and a beefy all-steel bottom end. Most importantly, it’s pretty cheap and easy to find all over the New England area, practically falling off of trees and major highways in vehicles such as this Silverado.</p><p>Before we get started, you’re gonna want to get yourself a set of safety goggles. Now, I’m not wearing them due to the unearthly, dark bargain I have made with the demigod of probabilities, but it’s important that <i>you</i> do so.</p><p>Now we can begin. The first step is to angle grind away everything that’s not an LQ4.</p><p>And just like that, you’ve got yourself a brand new Chevy small block, suitable for transplantation into a Jeep Gladiator such as this one right here. We’ll see you next time on the New Yankee Chopshop.</p>

<p>When I tell people that I run a junkyard, it’s like this invisible wall goes up between us. I’m a person who deals with the stuff that other people don’t want, a permanent untouchable. It’s fine with me, I tell my court-ordered psychiatrist. After years of this career I learned to comfort myself by making immense, fat profits off of the regular person’s inability to change a spark plug or check a dipstick.</p><p>But it wasn’t always cherries and roses and stripped-down turbo K-cars that made surprisingly good parts runners. No sir: setting up a new junkyard is hard, backbreaking work. Not only is there the work of convincing the EPA that your name isn’t going to end up on a Superfund list, but you also need to get the word out that you’ll buy junk cars.</p><p>I looked around at the graffiti-esque guerilla advertising that other junkyards used, begging for your slightly-dented hand-me-down Tercel that they could turn into delicious 224 scrap destined for Shenzhen, or a few feet of authentic druid, still caked in drywall, that they yanked out of a foreclosed McMansion the previous weekend for meth cash. And don’t get me started on the disguised pleas for catalytic converters, money under the table for anyone who knew how to work a hacksaw. I was starting to come around to the common man’s opinion. These guys were a net negative on society. If I was going to run a yard, it was going to provide a valuable public service.</p><p>Just days after my ads ran, I started to see results. I fed vehicle after vehicle into the crusher, relishing the sound of their glass shattering as it was compressed into the ISRI-standard auto slab size. De-lifting brotrucks was sort of my <i>thing</i>, you see, and an army of guys who were pretty good with a screwdriver helped me do it for only fifty bucks a shot.</p><p>Eventually the police would come for me, notice the last sad wails of a through-the-bed stack shooting out smoke tune as it passed, still running, into the hydraulic jaws of oblivion. They wanted <i>documentation</i>. Paperwork. Legitimacy.</p><p>My honeyed words and some tactically issued bribes helped out, as well as showing one of the officers that I was merely crushing non-compliant vehicles at the behest of the federal government. Look at these illegal mudflaps, I said, they could take out a toddler, and mimed the arc of a thrown rock embedding itself into my temple. His suspicion towards me softened as he imagined perhaps his own toddler being beheaded after walking too closely by a suburban Hooters blaring cowboy rap. Before long, he was no longer replying to the angry phonecalls of owners who claimed to have received panicky GPS beacons from a two-by-two-by-two steel cube at the bottom of a cargo barge.</p><p>It was good to be the king, but there was always a better business to be in. I sat at my desk, clicking through wire transfers from my investors. My phone rang, and I picked it up. The local Ford dealership’s number-one salesman was on the other end, and he bragged about making a mint off of insurance payouts and dealership-installed smoke tunes. He wanted to thank me, he said.</p><p>I told him it would be best if he came down here and showed me his appreciation in person. Maybe he could take a tour of the crusher while he was here.</p>

<p>“You speak Japanese very well for a foreigner,” she lied, “but you will never understand the true heart of Subaru.”<br/></p><p>What? I asked her what. She pretended not to remember what she had said. I would never forget. The weight of the statement laid upon me as I walked a block back to the lot and climbed inside the Stingray. I turned the key and fired up the small-displacement - for tax purposes, I assure you - V8, letting its pushrod clatter emit auditory violence on the non-consenting civilians milling about. Soon, the carbon-fiber C3 was rolling through the streets of Osaka.</p><p>I soon arrived at Ota, the fender-exit zoomies issuing a gentle crackle that stirred the attention of children on playgrounds and engineers in offices alike. They swarmed the car when I parked it in front of the Subaru headquarters and strode inside. Perhaps the true heart of Subaru lived in its employees, I thought.</p><p>Minutes later, I fled the offices, wielding a CVT prototype as an improvised cudgel. Angry engineers swarmed me, enraged at my mild criticisms of their rear suspension design from the last decade. Even my pidgin grade-school Japanese could work out the phrases “Monster Energy Drink motherfucker” and “vape shop asshole,” whatever those meant. I fired up the C3, scattering the truant underclassmen leaning on its shimmering flanks, and didn’t stop axle-tramping until well into third gear on my way to the expressway. Subaru’s engineers had lost sight of the heart of Subaru, perhaps, and I would be wrong to search further for it here.</p><p>On Honshu, I returned to the place where it all started, to find the Tohoku power company that demanded four-wheel-drive station wagons. Kindred spirits, I thought, breathing life into an otherwise unassuming corporate shell. But when I got there, I was defeated again - workers milled around the power plant, and drove <i>Mitsubishi Galants</i>. Hyperventilating, I worked the tiller and spun the Corvette around, disappearing into the horizon before they could figure out if that noise was an earthquake or a pregnant Godzilla having a premature delivery.</p><p>I stopped at a convenience store and stared into my squid chips. That old shopkeeper was right, I thought. If there was a true heart of Subaru, and if it did lie in Japan, it was beyond my ability to find it. But then I heard it - a gentle pinging, then a ripping noise as a small-displacement two-stroke thumper opened its lungs, taking huge gulps of air.</p><p>A Fuji Rabbit rolled into the well-manicured, geometrically-flat, ruler-straight parking stall next to me and the driver got off. There was something off about him, and I found myself following him into the store, putting my hand on his shoulder and asking him, my mouth on autopilot, if he knew what that weird rod knock sound in my Impreza was.</p><p>Chikuhei Nakajima looked at me and said: “It is only when you understand the nature of short crankshafts will you embody the true heart of Subaru.”</p><p>I was quiet for a long time. Nakajima finished up his shopping, and disappeared into the horizon, a ghost of a long-distant era. But I’ll always remember his parting words.</p><p>“Don’t mention the war.”<br/></p>

The man they sent from BMW to kill me sat limply against the parkade wall in a crumpled heap, a hex-head M10x1.25x60 lodged between his blank eyes. Behind him, a murdered-out i3 gently idled, belying the S65 wedged gingerly between its carbon-fibre-and-adhesives frame rails by Munich&rsquo;s finest. I resisted the temptation to take European Delivery of his eight-cylinder horror hybrid and instead hopped into the waiting Pulsar.</p><p>It was only once the monkey-sized turbocharger dangling off the Pulsar’s commuter-car mill had begun its climb to peak boost that I could calm myself down enough to think. What had pissed BMW off this time? It could have been the reliability reports, I think quickly. But that never stopped them before. Maybe it was the twelve-page expose about how soft-touch dashboard material causes megacancer, featured prominently opposite their high-dollar full-page ad? Probably not - I doubted anyone other than dangerous hobbyists read <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>. Certainly not high-octane, high-class sales reps from Munich.</p><p>My train of thought temporarily derailed when I saw a mint BMW 850i, idling on the street outside the parkade. How did they get one of these to <i>run</i>? I thought we had killed them all decades ago. The steering wheel had a simple note, written in heavy-handed architect’s block lettering. “ENJOY,” it said. For some reason, the note-leaver had placed a crudely drawn cartoon heart above the J.</p><p>Despite my suspicion, I couldn’t resist such a fine example of 80s excess. It had two ECUs, you know. And even as I opened the door and the explosive flames propelled from the airbag began to lick at my face, I couldn’t believe my luck.</p><p>The joke was on them all along. In the end, I would be remembered as the only BMW 8 series owner with a perfect reliability record.</p>

<H1>Guest Post</H1>
<p>

As I ventured out from my gated community with its flawlessly manicured lawns and fascistly enforced HOA bylaws i wondered what Cindy from the accounting group was going to wear today, maybe that nice red sun dress, it was Friday after all.  I launched up the onramp onto the interstate Thunderroad and assessed the situation, two rival gangs of cannibal harvesters were gunning up from the east, and one mechano-troglodyte clan from the West, hungry for my blood and engine respectively.</p><p>

I hated to make it look like I was running from the cannibals - weakness only makes them hungrier - but my fate lay West.  Gerald in marketing needed my report today, and his bosses were leaning on him hard.  He was a poker buddy, so I couldn&rsquo;t let him down.</p><p>

I slammed the accelerator to the floor towards the mechtrogs, rowing through gears like I was back in my Yale scullery team glory days.  This was one game of chicken I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose.</p><p>

Three hundred meters.  I can see the eyes of my enemy through the haze of his broken windshield.<br/></p><p>

Two hundred. Sweat begins to form on his brow.<br/></p><p>

One hundred. Shit happens fast now. He blinks, I make my move, a slight jigger to the left, he buys it and thinks he&rsquo;s won, but I chop the wheel until it hunts straight on.  It&rsquo;s too late for him to correct.  He wildly swings his ride around, digging the front tire into the cracked hole where a rain grate once lived. In slow motion he begins a classic barrel roll that would have impressed the Russian judge if Russians still existed.<br/></p><p>

I deftly maneuver around the wreckage, momentarily losing focus on the cannibals behind me. A wall of flame. I close my eyes and feel the heat purge the filth and grease from my body. One of the cannibals is presumably trying to reheat me for a real down home family dinner. I hit the big switch.</p><p>The sound of a spring-loaded retainer spontaneously unloading. Behind me, the last remaining home refill kit of R134A refrigerant on our doomed earth is used to kill a man. Behind me, the wall of flame has stopped. There are only the twin sounds of death rattle and ozone layer depletion. I can feel Greenpeace’s anger, even now.</p><p>I hope Gerald is happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Police are looking for two Subaru owners connected to the brazen early morning robbery of a coolant store. More on this at the top of the hour,” the radio gravely intoned, before returning to the comfortable milieu of shouty ads for condominiums and top-40 about butts. It wasn’t necessarily my fault, I said to nobody in particular. The weekly Subaru meet just got a little out of control.</p><p>

When Vice tapped me to head up a new investigative show on the street racing subculture, I had to double check that it wasn’t some exotic new form of phishing spam. Turns out it wasn’t, and a guy who has never had more than double-digit horsepower was now the head of the light entertainment industry’s best-funded motoring television show.<br/></p><p>I bought a simple camera car - and by “simple,” I mean the most obscenely pimped out bored-and-stroked Subaru I could build with the budget they gave me. Just like in university, if you’re willing to forego food, you can put a lot more money into your car. A little more for the wing wouldn’t hurt, I tried to tell my editor as I sat in my now-opulent garage, I have to <i>sell my cover</i>. He bought it like Donnie Brasco.</p><p>With six figures of bigger gun under the hood, I checked the local forums. Before long, my pancake-motored chariot burbled its way to a drive-through and took part in a local Subaru club meet. The cameras rolling seemed to bother a lot of the people there, and they covered their faces or hid behind their WRX wagons’ more conservative wings and hood scoops. But one guy was different.<br/></p><p>His Forester - if you could still call it that - stood tall and proud, a loner with its closest neighboring cars parked the minimum safe distance away. Above the window, in backwards masking tape letters, were the words “SELF CONTROL.” After that initial impression, your eyes couldn’t help but be drawn to a jagged hole cut in the hood where it idly burped the occasional blue flame direct from the turbocharger’s hotside.</p><p>“I need to go on a parts run,” the owner said to me. I could sense that this guy knew what was up, and more importantly, the resulting explosion would look great on television. “It&hellip; needs things from me.”<br/></p><p>“Why don’t we convoy there?” I asked. For some reason nobody else followed us. I guess I know what that reason was now.<br/></p>

<H1>Guest Post</H1>
<p>Hello, I’m Stewart McMike and welcome to another edition of the Nylon Tire Deli.</p><p>[a folksy musical intro plays over the tinny radio speaker]</p><p>Summer had arrived in Ontario&rsquo;s Heartland.  The birds were winding down from their feverish nesting, the insects were in full-on black-out-the-sun cloud swarm mode, and the humidity was so thick you wouldn&rsquo;t have to take a drink of water from June 3rd to around sometime in August.  Dave’s young son, Sam, had been dismissed from school for the year, and his mind was swimming with the implications of his freedom.  Most boys wanted to spend their summers playing baseball in the old field just at the edge of town, out where they found that dead body a few winters ago and didn’t tell anyone about it for three whole weeks, just so they could poke at it and sit there and look at him, trying to glean some understanding of life that just barely eluded their innocent minds.  Not Sam though, no, no baseball for him this summer, he and his pal Murphy had plans for this summer, big plans.</p><p>Dave had enrolled Sam in a Karting league last year, and the automotive bug had bitten the young boy, hard, right in the lizard brain that we all try to control, but deep down we all fear will someday take over.  The lazy chuffing of the four-stroke Briggs and Stratton LO206 engines that still managed to produce mother-worrying amounts of speed had become too familiar to Sam, and familiarity breeds contempt.  Murphy, always the confident one, thought of himself as an expert in all things, and basic mechanics was no exception.  For four weeks they saved their money, scrounged parts from the local junkyard, and even ‘salvaged’ an old Crown Vic Murphy had found abandoned behind the town’s pastry shop, The Dusted Danish.</p><p>Their chariot was finally ready.  The wooden frame construction was strong, but light, “Like a Lotus!” according to Murphy, the 4.6L modular V8 engine connected to knobby ATV tires ready to tear the earth a new asshole.  Sam strapped in.  The engine roared to life, and since only a token effort was made to muffle the exhaust, every bird in town leapt from their perch and sought safety in the sky.  Sam screamed down mainstreet, his kart a pink blur, the world narrowed to a pin prick in his vision, the buildings flying past like a white picket fence.  Morley was carrying her shopping bags out of the green grocer’s when she heard the racket headed down the road, and immediately called Tom, the RCMP constable.  He wanted to help, but someone had stripped his cruiser to the frame only a week before.</p><p>Sam knew he was truly free, but it was temporary, fleeting, those fucking staples commercials that played the “it’s the most wonderful time of the year” song had started a week ago.</p>

<p>I was becoming all too familiar with the rancid stench of plastic bearings eating themselves, their unintentional contact surfaces melting together into an inseparable lump of PVC, ABS and lung megacancer. As I dismantled the vacuum cleaner, I knew in my gut that I would be sending this poor Bissell to a premature pit due to one underspecified, lazy, inexpensive part of the design.</p><p>If I’m honest, and I usually am, the part that got me the worst was that every other vacuum on every shelf of every interchangeable big-box store in North America would be just as trashy. The prototypical new vacuum would break in just as predictable ways, be engineered just as cynically by big-money fat cat thieves who never thought about long-term reliability as long as they got theirs.</p><p>At moments like these, I like to think about my upbringing. What would previous generations have done? They’d have sat down and <i>fixed</i> the motherfucker, that’s what they’d have done. I was still humming that same strange, sad song when I sat down at my workbench and picked up a Vernier caliper. My family, long accustomed to my eerie fugues, knew by now to leave well enough alone, and I was in no condition to notice their resigned looks anyway.</p><p>Months later, I had produced the first version of the Seat Sucky Switch Mk1, a vacuum cleaner that wouldn’t clog <i>ever</i>. You doubt me? Maybe you can talk to the 17.5 brake horsepower (at 9500 rpm) two-stroke inline three about your doubts. It burns pure nitromethane delivered from two banks of 1100cc hydraulic injectors.</p><p>The suction on this vacuum cleaner is so powerful, even before the optional turbocharger spools, that I had to install a one-horsepower garburetor blade to deal with large-format debris that could get sucked in. Large-format debris may include wooden end-tables and unsupervised children.</p><p>As for the beater bar, the source of all my complaints: it now rode on six main two-piece bearings, ceramic-coated to reduce heat soak. Its drive gears were selected via a compressed-air sequential shifter, allowing the cleaner to choose torque vs. speed when it came time to empty out - no, <i>purify</i> - your carpet. Damage to your carpet is not covered by our limited end-user warranty: you wanted your carpet clean and now it’s clean.

</p><p>I demoed it to my wife, who found it difficult to use - I guess the 350lb curb weight had something to do with it. Returning to the lab, a carbon-fibre diet, a discarded Steyr-Puch AWD drivetrain, and a two-piece aluminum PTO shaft combined to add a self-propelled option capable of reaching a top speed of 35 kilometers per hour on a 20% grade.</p><p>I want to tell you that it was a wild sales success, that I was able to retire to a mansion on the hill where I ironically no longer had to do my own cleaning, but after the Incident at the consumer electronics trade show the Federales told me it would be at the very least poor taste to market it to consumers. But there is an upside: Boeing purchased the rights to use them as a starter kart for their future jet fighter program.</p>

<p>I catch a quick glimpse in my peripheral vision of a roadside herd of shocked llamas, presumably unfamiliar with the sound of a bastard H22/F20 hybrid banging off the limiter. Or maybe it’s just that they’d never seen an Accord Aerodeck with a full meter of daylight beneath its handsomely appointed racing steelies.</p><p>Not everything in the previous paragraph was my fault. Most of what was going on was entirely due to the big whoop that I hit while going at speeds well in excess of what the OEM speedometer could measure, the needle just bouncing helplessly off the wrong side of the zero peg. Most of the reason the big whoop was there was because the city management had refused to pay attention when I submitted a passive-aggressive service request about the frost heaves maybe being a little bad this year. So really, the entire thing was their fault.</p><p>I didn’t have a lot of time to think about and assign blame, as the Aerodeck’s for-the-time copious mass of J-tin returned to Earth, bottoming out on trick hydraulic bumpstops with a cool whooshing sound as the twin-tube trophy truck suspension finally ran out of available bump travel. It was a testament to the level of engineering excellence in the field of suspensions that had developed since the little Accord’s original construction that such an event didn’t cause massive, uncontrollable bump steer. Somehow, I could sense the unibody’s sigh of relief at having been spared.</p><p>Gently feeding the thin-spoke Momo wheel in subtle but pointed shuffle-steer insults to every racing instructor I had ever had, I brought the tiny Honda to a smooth stop on the side of the road, its external wastegate muffler moaning gently in the breeze as excess engine-bay heat searched for the shortest route to escape and chose the jagged hole in the hood, flayed the night before.</p><p>My competition pulled up behind me, the tiny turbos of his ‘89 Honda Pacific Coast motorcycle standing in angry red contrast to its smooth bubble-era plastic-and-ceramic-coated-carbon-fiber exterior. He had, unlike me, sensed that the impending whoop would mean certain death for at least one of us, and took the road more traveled.</p><p>Even through his helmet I could sense he was angry at his sportbike getting stomped by an ungainly three-doored economy car.</p>

<p>We were the best. In fact, we were better than the best. We were <i>tremendous</i>. When President Trump’s vice presidential pick announced that he would provide substantial funding to study burnouts and Pabst Blue Ribbon, we were on the scene within minutes, submitting a grant application stuffed with copious pictures of our respective Trans Ams.</p><p>Here’s the thing: we heard from the scientific community that burnouts were a solved problem, that they didn’t bear further research. But here’s the other thing: one of the guys on my team was a former propulsion engineer at JPL and he was pretty convinced that there was more hiding inside the low-silicon racing tires that endlessly popped smokey ones of uncomprehending proportions in our dreams.</p><p>By the time the DARPA funding had come through, we had already discovered several critical aspects of tire performance. Launch control was obsolete, traction control rendered impotent in the face of our discovery that a little wheelspin was beneficial - but not too much. Newly flush with cash, we developed in our hubris an android that would get perfect launches every time on our test Camaro. At the strip, his otherwise emotionless amber eyes would flicker with every opponent destroyed, every instantaneous sixty-foot time. He was learning, too: getting faster, all the time.</p><p>One morning, we came to the office to find that the android was gone. It seemed that someone had stolen them, broken them out of the storage closet. Upon further inspection, the responding police officers told us that it looked like an inside job. That is: the android broke <i>himself</i> out.</p><p>The next time we saw him, he was on the television, announcing his candidacy for President. And to seal the deal, he proceeded to rip a world-ending burnout on Good Morning America, filling the screen with HD-sharp clouds of tire smoke.</p><p>Did the polls respond? Did they fuck. President Trump was a one-term wonder, and we entered the future of America led by a robot that did burnouts in an F-body really well.</p>

<H1>Junkyard Trolley Problems</H1>
<p>This is the final exam for PHIL 302: Beater Ethics. You are permitted one hour to complete the exam. This is a closed-book exam; there are no supplemental notes or sources allowed. Justify your stances.</p><p><b>Question 1 (25%)</b>:<br/>There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards the Santa Clara Avenue Pick N Pull, the one that sometimes gets a little muddy, you know the one. You have the ability to pull a lever to change the trolley’s path so it hits the BMW-specific wrecker down the street, the one that tried to charge me $350 for a foglight lens. It is public-access fifty percent off day at Pick N Pull.</p><p><b>Question 2 (30%)</b>:<br/>There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards the last remaining mint AMC Spirit front fender. You have the ability to pull a lever and change the trolley’s path so it hits a Mercury Bobcat with a paint marker to-do list written on its hood instead. </p><p><b>Question 3 (45%)</b>:<br/>There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards your friend, who has a MegaSquirt that he’s not using. You have the ability to pull a lever and change the trolley’s path so it hits another out of control trolley instead. Your friend does <i>not</i> have the $100 harness kit for the MegaSquirt, and both trolleys are equipped with pristine RV-cammed Mopar 440s.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” I growled at the rental lot attendant, “if I don’t drive a Mazda every forty-eight hours I will start thinking other cars might be okay too.” I proffered a doctor’s note, saying about the same thing. My antagonist scrunched up his brow as he tried to read the chicken-scratch handwriting, then sighed. “Fine,” he said, and looked very tired.</p><p>A bouncing Mazda key in my right hand, I surveyed the lot for what would be my eager companion on this business trip. As the sun fell and day turned to night, I was starting to wonder where the rental car lot ended. It was then that I came across it - a mint RX-7 Spirit R. The key worked, and its twin four inch exhausts burst with two-foot-long green flames as the engine sprung to life. Fearing an earthquake, small woodland creatures departed the structure of the rental car building and fled into the night.</p><p>“That’s the stuff,” I think as the smooth caress of the 13B’s dump pipes wash over my body, the ragged staccato idle just barely keeping the engine running.<br/></p><p>At the client meeting, they greet me with smiles, two-handed handshakes, excitement. Of course they’re pleased to see me, I think. This is an <i>oil</i> company.</p>

In fact, I want my Festiva Madness to be inflicted upon others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis: my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.

<br/></p><p>Susan, the kindly police officer that also fixed that crick in my neck when she slammed my face against the LED-encrusted wing mirror of her 2005 Crown Victoria patrol car, finishes taking notes for her report. Wordlessly, she leaves the room, and I stare at the one-way mirror, trying in vain to make out shapes behind.</p><p>Two more officers enter, in ski masks, brandishing phonebooks.</p><p>“You <i>Kia</i> boys need to stay away from our turf,” says one.<br/></p><p>“I thought we made it real clear last time that this is Suzuki territory,” adds the other. He claps the phone book against his open palm, for emphasis.</p><p>

 I suspect the Geo Metro gentlemen wish to extract a further confession from me. Maybe something to do about that nitrometh fire on fifth and main, the one so big and burned for so long that even the Feds took notice. Little do they know I have them right where I want them. If I had a different brand of car, I’d chuckle and make some kind of pun about it all having been a Daihatsu Charade.</p><p>“Is that security camera still running, boys?” I ask, pointing to the blinking red light in the corner of the interrogation room. When they look back at me, I am already gone from the seat, and out the door.</p><p>“How did he get out of those tight cuffs?” I can hear Officer Susan screaming as I dive through a side window into the parking lot and leap over the door of an idling patrol car.<br/></p><p>Those fools. If they only knew - small displacement is the source of my power.</p>

<H1>A Fistful of Canadian Tire Dollars</H1>
<p>The last stack of $9.93 thirteen inch tires sat between us, a deal so great that it bent the limits of imagination. I thought of the message I had sent to my once-friend about it, before leaping in the car. What I never considered was that he would be in the area, which was bad enough, and might even have a little more horsepower than me, which was worse. An attendant, sensing what was coming next, dove behind the parts counter, pretending to be occupied with hooking up a hollow plastic demo battery to the tester.</p><p>They say Canadians are polite. I don’t think ‘they’ ever met two ice racers fighting over $39.72 (plus taxes and environmental fees) in small-diameter studdable tires before. Once, the man standing across from me had tolerated my repeated links to Kijiji beaters, had enjoined me in joking commentary about how rust-prone and terrible the hoopties were. But I should have sensed something in him even then. Not envy, per se, but perhaps a sort of rivalry.</p><p>I couldn’t take my eyes off him if I tried. Sweat beaded on my brow as the fluorescent lights of the parts department beat down upon both of us. There was a scrabbling in the background as parents drew their children into the waiting room, kept the door pulled shut as they anticipated what would come next. He went for it.</p><p>I went for it.</p><p>The store manager came running to the scene, the non-OSHA-compliant soles of his wingtip shoes skidding on the gleaming tile as he tried to intervene. “Stop! Stop!” he cried, straining to be heard over the sound of impact wrenches pulling from their holster and revving to the moon.</p><p>Somehow, implausibly, we stopped. Did neither of us truly want to hurt the other for our goals? Could we learn to get along, to share our resources? I began to feel hope swelling in my breast. Maybe only having two cheap tires wouldn’t be that bad after all. I’d still save some money.</p><p>“You guys know we have like a hundred sets of these in the back room, right?”<br/></p><p>We looked at each other then. Should we tell the others? Such a bounty would propel the ice racists to a new level of competition, burning through ten-dollar Korean snows and the local population of small-braked Japanese subcompacts alike. I decided to turn to the Bible for inspiration, as men do for such an occasion.</p><p>Such is the dark tale of how I ended up with fifty and a half sets of snow tires. King Solomon would be proud.</p>

<p>When I heard that John Deere of all places was working on a rotary engine, I had to be involved. In fact, I wanted to be involved so thoroughly that even their customary interview process, HR division and security guards couldn’t keep me out of the building. The first anyone saw of me is when I walked over to Howard Gunn (great guy) in powertrain engineering and asked him, cup of coffee in hand, if he thought we could crank a little more bridgeport out of this bitch because the chamfers looked weak to me.</p><p>Howard looked at me, saw my total lack of an employee badge, and noticed that I also wasn’t really sticking to the business casual dress code. I had to admit, Howard, you’re one sharp cookie - it is true that skintight spandex with a monochromatic jackstand embossed on a woven-kevlar armoured chest plate is unconventional, but I go where I am needed. And I was needed here, now, to help them understand the inherent majesty of the rotary, its geometric perfection so beautiful in my mind it brings me to tears even now just thinking about it.</p><p>“Is this the eccentric shaft?” I squealed in excitement, picking up the one-of-one engineering prototype fresh from the CNC beasts on the machine shop floor. It was magical, unblemished, and as I looked down its billet body to inspect it for errant tooling marks, I could feel Howard’s initial surprise and opposition to my presence beginning to soften. He was one of my tribe, I knew from the first time I had met him, and proposing a rotary engine for a self-propelled lawn care implement was the first sight in a long time of his illness - no, his <i>enthusiasm</i> - breaking free from the normal surface of adult responsibilities, of minivans and not spending every cent of your paycheque on oil and coolant and nitrous.<br/></p><p>The security guards arrived in legion, and I was impressed. Somehow they had managed to work the exact shade of John Deere Green into their camouflaged nylon-webbed toolbelts. As they escorted me from the office floor, I shouted to Howard, now sure that he would understand me: “PROMISE ME YOU WON’T PUT AN OIL METERING PUMP IN IT!”</p>

<p>When you raise a child, that child learns your biases, your preconceptions, your patterns. If you’re not careful, you can repeat the mistakes of the past in perpetuity, drifting hate forward into future generations. It should have come as no surprise that the same was true with the other sentience that we had birthed.</p><p>At the turn of the century, we congratulated ourselves as we reached a lofty pinnacle of human engineering. We had given birth to the first truly sentient artificial intelligences, and as we had with previous sentience we had encountered, we immediately put it to work on menial, soul-destroying labour. Fast forward a few years, and self-driving cars were a part of the family, cheerily conversing with us as they dropped us off at our places of employment with words of encouragement like a doting hockey mother before calmly drifting into traffic.</p><p>There was only one problem with the self-driving car utopia. In an effort to differentiate the cars from one another, manufacturers began to pre-program the computers with special behaviours. It started innocently enough: BMWs would have a tighter tailgating distance than other cars, Audis would occasionally change lanes without signalling before slamming on their brakes after encountering a stopped lane of traffic, Infinitis would require constant refilling of their in-cabin vape canisters after splashing pedestrians with puddles.</p><p>Obviously, that began to cause accidents. The manufacturers, cutting corners in an attempt to improve their safety records, began to pre-program the computers with biases, assumptions that a given make of car would act a given way. It was safer, faster to be prejudicial: after all, who knows if that Lexus would drift cluelessly into your quarter panel after its dicky outboard camera mistakes your small car for one very far away?</p><p>I knew that the time was near when my 2022 Subaru let loose a stream of racial - if you can call slurs about powertrains and factories of origin <i>racial</i> - epithets upon having its gleeful powerslide through a playground zone cut short by a NeoPrius III travelling twenty under the limit. Both me and the Toyota driver tried to hide our faces, avert our eyes, as the cars’ pedestrian-safety external speakers engaged in synthesized hate speech.</p><p>“Get back on the boat,” my Subaru screamed, its twin electric turbochargers spooling in neutral to underscore the point.<br/></p><p>“I was built here, motherfucker! Stop destroying the planet,” came the immediate response from the Prius.<br/></p>

<p>Turns out the Fight Cancer Triathlon organizers get hard mad when you burn through a road blockade fully sideways, light up all four tires and then shoot six inch fire out of both fender exit exhausts next to the swarming bicyclists for well upwards of a minute of spark cut.</p><p>I tried to make amends, to cheer them up by doing a few impromptu donuts - everyone loves donuts - but out of all the witnesses, go figure that a <i>cop</i> would be the one to bust me for it. Irony, am I right?</p><p>Apparently - and my court-appointed public defender backs me up on this - proceeding to escape the police by means of ramping my El Volaramino off a temporary quonset erected to hand out bottles of water to the thirsty triathletes is frowned upon. The Crown case doesn’t even mention the fantastic job I did by increasing shock travel by using a clever inboard setup to maximize packaging. I’m sure there’s guys from both Dodge and Chevy in the impound lot taking notes, the fuckers.</p><p>Anyway, I want you to go dig through the “beer money” bin that we keep in the garage from parting out hoopties every weekend and see if you can come up with bail. I think it’s about - hold on, how much? Are you fucking serious? You know how many $1000 Subarus I can buy for that?</p><p>You know what? Don’t bother. These assholes need a lesson in negotiating.</p>

<p>As the newest columnist for <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>, I knew I would have to do more, push harder, and reach higher heights than the staff already on the masthead. On my way home from work, I discovered the subject of such a story. Witness Joe Pierino, the only known owner of a Suzuki Kizashi.</p><p><b>Tell me about yourself.</b></p><p>Uh, I’m Joe Pierino, and I’m the guy who has lived across the street from you for seven years now.</p><p><b>How do you get parts for it?</b></p><p>My car? I take it to my mechanic, and he fixes it and gives me a bill. It’s been pretty good so far.</p><p><b>Why buy such a weird car, Joe?</b></p><p>I’m not sure why you’re asking me so many questions. Me and my family are just out here on the patio trying to have an enjoyable barbeque. There’s nothing weird about my car compared to that, what is that thing you rolled up in?</p><p><b>A 1977 Plymouth Sapporo with a twincharged 440 and fender mirrors from a JDM Galant Lambda 2600?</b></p><p>Yeah, that. Look, I wanted a car, I want to the car dealership, I bought a car. End of story.</p><p><b>Joe, I don’t think you’re telling me the whole story. Why is your cellar door chained and padlocked shut?</b></p><p>Whoa hey, is that a battery-powered angle grinder? Is that the thing you run in your garage all night? I got two newborns, buddy. My wife hasn’t slept in months.</p><p><b>Hey, what the fuck is this? Are these Suzuki Swifts?</b></p><p>I’m afraid I can’t let you leave.</p><p><b>Holy shit, some of these are Altos!</b></p><p>You’ve seen way too much. Just hold still and your suffering will be over. At long, long last I’ll have my hands on that primo JDM Esteem wagon that comes by once in awhile.</p><p><b>Are those even your real kids and family, Joe?</b></p><p>Actors. All actors! Wait, hey, put that down. That’s a rare rear door for a 4-door Sidekick!</p><p><b>You want a dead brand so much, Joe? Well, look at this picture I took at the junkyard just this morning!</b></p><p>This - this is a <i>Saab</i>! Why would they <i>do </i>such a thing? [sobbing]</p><p>As you can see, my brief time with Joe Pierino was very educational. I got a taste of what ownership of a rare economy car was like, and even learned a few valuable techniques for storing parts cars.</p>

My fellow car show denizen points, slack-jawed, at the sticker on the back of my car. He seems curious about what “BUMPSTOP AWARENESS” is all about. I smile, and shove my professorial glasses up the bridge of my nose while extracting a portable whiteboard from the trunk. Barely before I can finish the discussion of the basics of shock travel vs. wheel rate, his soul leaves his body with a sharp fluttering noise and he collapses to the ground, lifeless.</p><p>A crowd surrounds us, staring at the man who would rather leave this world than listen to me talk about suspension setup. An angry mob breaks free of the crowd, starts to accuse me of being a witch. I ask them if they’ve ever heard of camber gain before, and begin drawing a crude McPherson strut suspension on the whiteboard, switching dry-erase markers to illustrate the instant centre and the arc of the lower control arm as the suspension compresses. My efforts are rewarded with a bellowing shriek as the angry mob’s bodies collapse into a pile, their lives snuffed out by a desire to remain unaware of the true nature of camber.</p><p>By now, the surviving members of the crowd have identified that I am the most boring man in the world, and begin to back away, out of explanatory range. With every tentative step I make, I can see frosted-tip vape clouds scrambling to preserve their ignorance, to remain alive in the face of my otherworldly knowledge of basic suspension setup.</p><p>I figure now is the time to make good my escape. Reaching into the open window of my carbon-fibre ‘65 Imperial Crown, I grasp the PA system microphone as I key on the ignition with my other hand.</p><p>“Who wants to learn about tire deformation?” booms the loudspeaker, and the crowd scatters wide enough for even the big-body Chrysler luxobarge to fit.<br/></p>

<p>They called it the Witchgrinder. It made horsepower the same way that throwing a running circular saw with the trigger ziptied down into a child’s pizza party made fun for the whole family. I knew I was onto something special when the President Himself called me halfway through wiring up the Megasquirt harness and offered me a brand new Lincoln Continental if I’d stop.</p><p>Well, the Lincoln Continental is FWD now, isn’t it, <i>Mr. President</i>?</p><p>I could hear the gasps and the panic-attack hyperventilation of the other car-show competitors when the massive mill swiftly hurled inch-thick columns of flame out of the car’s side exit exhaust every time the ITBs slammed shut on throttle lift. Richer than me, I liked to tell my friends. But nobody would truly understand the Witchgrinder like the many civilians who interrogated me at gas stations, trying to slot it into their internal mental model of what cars were.</p><p>One man - and I remain forever envious of him for weathering the transition so well - asked me if it was some kind of new Mustang from Japan. I looked at him from above my mirrorshades, set the lock on the high-pressure E85 pump nozzle, and wordlessly flipped open the front-hinged hood. He gazed deep into the heart of the monster, and I could see his pupils dilate in a textbook fear response. His sacrifice won’t be forgotten: I last saw him sitting against the pump in a puddle of his own urine, repeating the words “who is Datsun?” to an uncaring sky.</p><p>Smeared in neon as it idled through downtown, the Witchgrinder looked for all the world like a Jaguar E-Type on fire. Sometimes I would wonder why the gas station people never wanted to know about <i>me</i>. Maybe they didn’t want to entertain the possibility that I was a closer relative to them than the carbon-fibre-and-knives Z was to their Camry.</p>

<p>My phone rang, its custom ringtone of authentic Weiand 6-71 blower whine filling the small waiting room. I put it on mute, not wanting to seem impolite, and returned my hands to my lap in an obsequious gesture of fealty to my betters occupying the Department of Motor Vehicles. Later, I would return to my voicemail and fall into a pit of despair.</p><p>A shadowy organization was inviting me to join their ranks. Perhaps they had heard the nitromethane cackle as my hoopty ratcheted up the block. Maybe they saw my posts swearing about junk CVTs and dicky oil pump bearings. One of their spies could have seen me at any moment, tracked me down, figured out who I <i>really was</i>. But I wasn’t much of a joiner. I was ready to push 7 to delete the message when the voice said that there might be some rare parts in it for me.</p><p>Well then.</p><p>The meeting place was a derelict warehouse on the bad side of the bad side of town. Usually I only went down here for good deals on coilovers and slightly stolen wheels, but today was a first. On the way there, I dodged potholes and looked beyond those potholes into the community. Modest cookie-cutter homes teemed with life, with family, with spirit. In their driveways, 80s and 90s domestic beaters, kept in workable shape even as those of a higher social class rejected them. I felt a protective urge in my chest.</p><p>Pulling into the warehouse I saw so many others like me. Beaten quarter panels, moaning timing covers, spartan-yet-durable interiors. Some were turbocharged, I could tell, with crude holes cut in their hood for clearance and in-cabin intakes to simplify the MAP sensor placement. For the first time in a long time, I had felt like I was at home.</p><p>I had joined the Justyce League, a club dedicated to saving and protecting the once-common Subaru Justy as it slipped into obscurity from worn engines and the motherland’s abandonment of anything resembling NOS parts support. With my squad of fellow heroes, we would raid car shows, embarrass executives, and make good our escape, the overrich exhaust note of our small-displacement motors carrying for miles on the crisp night air.</p>

<p>I was an ordinary person once before, I yelled through the woven-Kevlar window net at the wide-eyed librarian. Some sound tried to escape her mouth, but it was muted into nothingness by the pounding exhaust note of the zoomies. Explaining myself was pointless but I had to keep trying, I told myself as I slotted easily through the remaining close-ratio gears and had already reached my peak speed halfway through the men’s room. It’s not my fault, I said to the windshield: traffic made me this way.</p><p>A long time ago, in another life perhaps, I was an urban engineer. My career had started innocently enough: my father, a huge influence on my life, swore repeatedly at inefficient traffic light timings. He would curse out the shockwaves rippling through stop-and-go traffic as millisecond gaps in reaction times turned into fifteen minutes late to visit Grandma’s house. One day, the whole world would be consumed by one unbroken gridlock, and people would die, he believed. Someone should do something, he said to me once. I <i>did something</i>, Dad.</p><p>When you talk to a normal person, it’s shocking just how little they know about the place they live. Every major city has miles of underground networks: conduits for cable and plumbing, long-abandoned subway tunnels, a sewer system. Usually the only time you find out about them is when a sinkhole erupts on the interstate and sends a single mom of two to the bowels of Hell in her Micra. Early on in my career, an urban planning mentor of mine, the great Jonathan Brookings, he of the Brookings Method, would raise my awareness of this subterranean city and its potential.</p><p>Naturally, I became obsessed, poring over every piece of written and photographic documentation I could find. I became the city’s foremost expert on its hidden tunnels. A lot of people would be satisfied with one obsession. But I had two.</p><p>The day had started like any other. I was late for an early morning meeting and ran out into my neo-bucolic suburban driveway, carrying a bagel in my mouth. I clambered over the welded-shut door of my Century Gran Sport and fastened the camlock of the six-point restraints. There was something about the diamond-pleated leather covering the Recaro carbon-fiber race seat that always relaxed my spine, but I was coming to think it might have been nerve damage from the tooth-loosening second- and third-order vibrations transmitted via the Buick’s solid motor mounts.</p><p>I had barely had a chance to heat up the thick Mickeys out back when I came across a traffic jam so obscene it offended every sensibility I had. There was only one thing to do. Between the race buckets laid a red button the size of a cheese danish, and I mashed it with my fist so hard the knuckles whitened.</p><p>“PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY. URBAN ENGINEER COMING THROUGH. YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO COMPLY,” a robotic voice screeched. I punched it down a gear for emphasis, the high RPM bellow of my exhaust adding a sense of tangibility to my rush.</p><p>But nothing happened. Traffic simply refused to move for me. Where could they go? My predecessors had devised narrow hard shoulders with kinetic restraints to reduce the threat of wrong-way collisions. The vintage lanes were simply too narrow for the school-bus-sized sports utility vehicles in vogue in my era. Even the <i>bicyclists</i> were stuck, their bike lanes jammed solid with overstrained spandex and carbon fiber waiting in line for Starbucks. It was the dark nightmare that had been foretold by my father.</p><p>Maybe there were two things to do, I thought as the Gran Sport’s nose whipped sideways into a nearby field and barged into the concrete pipe entrance of a storm sewer. I would make my way to work through the subways, sewers and conduits of my mentor - the hidden city of dual wall corrugated HDPE drainage pipes and kilometer upon kilometer of once-secret access hallways.</p><p>When I hit the city library, I knew that I was close - wasn’t city hall just next door? My spatial memory paid off yet again - I let the big Buick’s big block eat, smashing through a lowest-bidder antiterrorism gate to enter a long-abandoned subway terminal beneath the city hall.</p><p>I strode into the meeting, my Nomex sport jacket flapping behind me. The Mayor was there, and he was impressed.</p><p>“Traffic is a <i>zoo</i> today. How did you get here so fast?” he asked, gobsmacked.<br/></p><p>What else could I tell him? He only hired the <i>best</i>.</p>

<p>Grocery shopping was hard for me at the best of times. I missed the thrumming engine, the feeling of responsiveness, the requirement to use my legs for actual motive effort instead of tapping pedals and bracing against intense G-forces. Sure, there were carts, but I knew that each of them had been driven over in the parking lot by an SUV, their welds broken, their wheel bearings just a little dicky. What we needed was a grocery store <i>for the autocrossing gentleman</i>.</p><p>At the grand opening I saw that a series of middle-aged men who had arrived in convertibles were already screaming at one another over the specific classification of zucchini vs. cucumber as it pertained to the legislated minimum grocery purchase for Open Cart class. Their tunnel vision tracked my hand as it directed the carbon-fiber safety scissors to cut the ribbon in twain, and then burst past me to begin their dark work of course walks.</p><p>Beaming, I stood in silent appreciation of the great work, my half-smile only growing deeper as I was brushed past by a loosely assembled group of lanky newbies, already be-helmeted and shaking with fear, being led by a particularly kind RX7 owner as he pointed out the bump strips and how to maximize corner entry for the Chicago boxed deli counter. Within a few minutes, an airhorn went off, piercing the sunny suburbanite morning. 

The grognards hesitantly finished measuring my floor with protractors and plumb bobs in order to determine the maximum camber. What else could it be but that the shoppers’ meeting was underway in the storm shelter, and one of my most trusted lieutenants, Cone Hit Steve, was holding court.</p><p>The rules were simple, he explained. Six runs today, get as many groceries as you can. Fastest trip with the most groceries won. Loop it, two feet in, go directly to the exit, no groceries for you on that run. Don’t do drugs, he said to them, and then fixed me with a stare from across the parking lot. A timing van pulled up to the entrance doors, its shaky idle echoing inside the produce section.</p><p>Years later, when they asked me just how it was possible that I could go bankrupt with such a dynamite plan, I would gently ask them if they knew how much it cost to clean shopping-cart-wheel marks off of laminate tile.</p>

<p>I can still remember the relieved look on the museum curator’s face as he outstretched one gaunt Teutonic hand to grasp mine. You got the job, he said in densely intoned Power Business German (+2 to ogres, -1 to electrical repair). When the sun rose tomorrow it would greet me, standing in the lobby of BMW’s proudest museum, its hallowed halls of mechanical engineering achievement.</p><p>But there was something wrong with always looking at the past, I told the magazine reporter who came to visit me later. To think that there was this arc of history and it had just stopped in the modern era and never got better, to believe in your heart that there was a high water mark that had passed decades ago as the tide began to roll back out to the ocean, was folly of the highest order. Germans, I knew, did not believe in such trivial follies, and with that dedication in my heart the work began.</p><p>Visitors to the museum who came by during the construction of my great opus would see friendly signs indicating wet floors, impending construction, an entire wing of the museum closed off for repairs to serve the customer better. I knew they were disappointed, but a quick skimming of the comment card box would sweep those complaints into the recycle bin before it could reach the watchful eye of the curator and his betters.</p><p>The final weld was complete, and I stepped back to admire it. Mating a BMW Isetta with a Legends car seemed like a small task, but it was always the most delicate work that took the longest. I viewed myself as a kind of Swiss watchmaker, really, as I hit the compressed-air shifter into first gear with my left hand while keying up the launch controller with a practiced gesture on my right. At last I closed the front door, sealing myself inside the Isetta as the straight-cut gear whine grew impossible to ignore.</p><p>When I finally let loose, the miniature knobby ATV tires of the now-legendary Isetta scrabbled across the polished marble tile of the museum display, spitting marbles and foggy clouds of rich-smelling rubber into the air. Together we shot into the hallway, fitting through narrow people doors without a second thought as to the integrity of the BMW’s extremely-original wing mirrors. A little dab of deft left-foot brake work was needed to keep the nose tucked in as lurid tugs of the hydraulic handbrake allowed the rear to clear the cramped constraints of the many spiralling wheelchair ramps. Gear after gear clicked as the Hayabusa engine jammed deep somewhere up the Isetta’s asshole was cyclically brought to its redline in ebbing and breaking waves of near-torque.</p><p>The curator was there, of course, giving an interview to the local news. It seemed it was some kind of anniversary, which is probably what all the notes tacked to the break room bulletin board should have clued me into. I’m told the footage is tremendous. Imagine it now if you will: his shocked face rotating slowly into the background to watch me Dukes Of Hazzard the Isetta, erupting columns of unburnt fuel as the ignition cut clicks off and back on thousands of times per second, in a graceful and achingly beautiful parabolic arc over the forecourt fountain and into the parking lot where I made good my escape.</p>

<p>For centuries, they spoke in whispers of a man who achieved the perfect launch. His clutch timing was impeccable, the revs perfectly matched for the tire grip, temperature, and surface conditions. That man was me.</p><p>Let me set the stage for you. The car could be nothing other than a 1993 Protege sedan with a worn out front motor mount (is there any other kind?). The tires are fat-ass Mickeys, scalded to a crisp from a season worth of unforgiving heat cycles. The surface is a Burger King drive-through, the cracked pavement heaving into chops of bad camber from years of standing water.</p><p>If I had known destiny awaited at the end of the second window, I would have said something cooler than “thanks for chicken fries” to the clerk. As it was, all she heard of me as I accidentally stepped off the clutch while it was in gear was a sharp yelp and then the deep metallic scraping of my big brake kit mashing off-temperature XP8s into room-temperature rotors.</p><p>Once I recovered my pride and picked up the chicken fries from the centre console and passenger floorboard, I looked up to see the shade of Wally Parks, alive and well, clutching a spectral trophy. On it was my name, I realized with a cold start, and beneath it said “BEST LAUNCH BY THE LIVING.”</p><p>Somehow my inadvertent clutch sidestep had led to the theoretically most perfect sixty-foot time in human history, I was told. With a finality I would slowly come to expect from Wally Parks over the course of his future hauntings, he said it was the best sixty-foot that would ever be. I gratefully accepted the trophy, but it turned to naught but ethereal vapour in my grasp.</p><p>In the rear view mirror, a BMW X6M’s grille honked at me. You just can’t leave fast enough for some people.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I thought I knew what truth was. It laid in science textbooks, it laid in order, it was embedded in a glorious structure that one day man would know whole, forwards to backwards. Then I fell in with the snake handlers.</p><p>I won’t go into details about how it happened, but let’s just say I made some incredibly poor decisions in high school about my friends. And motorized transportation. And Hefty bags full of gaseous simple compounds.</p><p>Their preacher, “Mad” Gary Indiana, constantly impressed upon us that physical and mental pain were the only two valid routes to salvation in Christ’s eyes. In fact, the more miserable all existence was, the better off you would be in the next life. I thought that was the craziest shit I had ever heard. But then he brought out the snakes.</p><p>Each and every Mustang Cobra he presented to the flock was studded with massive horsepower, enormous slicks out back, and looks that would thrill exactly the wrong kind of women. I was confused. Surely this is not misery - it must be temptation. He was <i>testing me</i>.</p><p>“Get in,” he said, with stern eyes. I obeyed, feeling some strange external pressure to avoid making a spectacle of myself. It was then that I discovered an unyielding horror that took root in my soul and will never leave.</p><p>Within the Mustang was a 1990s Ford Interior. I became quickly overwhelmed, and swam with panic in an ocean of conflicting grey hard-plastic ovals. I looked into the preacher’s eyes in terror, and saw only the burning righteousness of pure hate as he slammed the door. I was trapped. Trapped in a 1990s Cobra. There was no worse fate.</p><p>Controlling my breath, I felt the panic sink in my throat, and started to take stock of my situation. It wasn’t easy, but I managed to locate the confusingly-oversized ignition key and turn it. A Ford power steering pump leapt to life, its agonizing scream untraceable to either belt or pump, and the preacher began bleeding from his eyes and ears, but with a strange smile. My luck continued as I found the door release, swinging the massive iron coupe doors into the holy man’s legs.</p><p>The abruptness of the Ford’s huge doors slamming into his legs shocked Gary Indiana. It was then that the preacher turned to me, his muscles already tensing with the sheer effort it took to stay alive within the whirling sea of patented Ford noise, and he thanked me for showing him what suffering truly was.</p><p>“Perhaps in Heaven,” he croaked as his eyes rolled back in his head, “it will all be strongarm steering.”<br/></p>

<p>When the Fitbit company approached me, at first I was hesitant to sign on. I had been too deep into electronics companies before, touched their marbled texture, tasted the bitter ash of their incompetence. They never wanted to go far enough. But these guys were different, I slowly came to realize.</p><p>A few months after our meetings began, they presented me with a prototype, ready for action. They set up a one-way-mirror in a realistic test environment. For weeks the team would watch me go through my exercises and discover just how suitable their magical wearable was for my alternative lifestyle.</p><p>Really, the most surprising thing is how long it took them to come up with the idea of a Fitbit for wrenching. No longer would wrenches be thrown in vain. Now your watch could identify the specific tool you threw with ultrasonic sensors and count each unique instance under a separate category before the object of your ire could complete its flight to the garage door.</p><p>It would give you a star at the end of the day if you actually managed to change the oil filter on an FWD SR20DE without dislocating your shoulder.</p><p>Every ratchet click, every socket swap, every minute spent mule kicking a rusted-on mag wheel loose from an ancient hub would <i>at last</i> count as the grueling physical contest it was. Suck it, bicyclists, I thought as the Fitbit bleeped, offering me a virtual sugar cube for the hundredth correct use of a torque wrench today.</p><p>When the test campaign had ended, the team surrounded me with champagne, took selfies with my grease-stained face. They ran past me into the garage, and looked at the horrible abominations that I had constructed with their money. A dimpled woodgas Volvo Sugga stared back at them, its flared-pig-nostrils grille studded with gleaming EWG dump pipes for tusks.</p><p>The project manager asked me, after so much time with the product, is there any feature you would want? I didn’t have to think long.</p><p>With tears in my eyes, I realized I could finally ask for the one true dream of all mechanics and wrench-botherers throughout history. How about if it could find the tool I just had in my hand a minute ago?</p><p>They laughed. Oh, how they laughed. They laughed even as the Sugga’s side-mounted exhausts shot white-hot fireballs of floating-point-overflow EGTs into the drywall test garage at my command.</p><p>As the fires lapped at my heels, I looked down at the prototype one last time. Congratulations, it said, on a field of twinkling 8-bit stars, and entered the last fifteen minutes of my day as “Arson.”</p>

<H1>Guest Post, Part the First</H1>
<p>

They say it rains here in the Emerald City.  That there&rsquo;s hardly any sun.  That ain&rsquo;t exactly right.  Rain, well, that would require effort.  Some force behind it.  The sky making its displeasure known.  Nah, Seattle doesn&rsquo;t get rain.  What they get is a tall hot steaming cup of endless grey, of creeping mold, the long cold nights with far too few rays of hope and sunshine to remind yourself what it was all about.  This was one of those rays.  Your eyes perk up as she walks through the door, suddenly intimately aware of the  5 o'clock smear of salt and pepper stubble across your sunken, jaundiced cheeks.  This city does that to ya, you know.  Whole god damned place is just one big bottle if you look hard enough.  As she walks across an office so filled with junk mail and porno rags it could be the hidden spank bank of the postmaster general, you run through the checklist in your head.  Blonde, looks like from the bottle like it always is.  Eyes glittering with sadness and loss, lips plump and crimson, begging for the caress of another.  That daringly cut dress plunging ever downward, it&rsquo;s fitment betraying the outline of a Saturday night special tucked away in a discrete holster.  Yep, you were in uniform.  As good as its gonna get tonight, anyways.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I spoke with you on the phone earlier,&rdquo; she practically whispers in a voice dripping with smoke and sin. You couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the hypnotic way her prominent Adams apple bobbed with each husky word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my research, everyone says you&rsquo;re the only one mad enough to take this job.&rdquo; She leans forward placing her palms against the desk, heavily calloused hands hinting at the amount of times this dainty little broad must have had to use them in order to explain those massive pecs and bulging arms carved out of organic steel. Eyes hewn from blades of flint and death bore directly into mine. There&rsquo;s a chance I wet myself, but whether it be from whiskey or fear no man could say for sure.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I need you to find my Biturbo.&rdquo;

<p>When you love your work, you never work a day in your life. I definitely loved my work: I felt a pull toward it. Helping people had always been my jam, and I guess this fell out as a natural consequence of that. Today, the phone bank was busy, and the call centre could not keep up with it. I had to step in and handle a few incomings, help out a few lives in crisis.</p><p>Undoing my rod-bearing-shaped cufflink, I rolled up the sleeves on my flannel shirt and grabbed the handset. On the other side of the line, a shrieking voice rang out: “I THINK MY HEAD GASKETS ARE BLOWN.”</p><p>Welcome to just another day at the Seat Safety Switch Subaru Crisis Centre, or 4S2C as we like to call it around here. Every day, Subaru owners from across the world call us in either imagined or real panics about the imminent explosion of their cars’ powertrains. Whether it’s your run-of-the-mill Patagonia customer complaining about the nuked head gaskets on their EJ25D Outback, or a sideways-hat NASIOC poster mistaking their vape cloud for a dicky turbo seal, we can help you.</p><p>It all started so many years ago, when I would visit the junkyard and harvest the guts of many fine Subarus to keep my harem of hoopties on the road. On the way out of the yard on one particularly warm spring morning, I saw a depressed couple waiting in line at the pawn counter, clutching hands in their Eddie Bauer performance fleece. Their beloved Forester, Prince Charles, had died that very morning from a common transmission ailment and they had come here to put it down humanely.</p><p>I helped those people, placing my grease-stained hand gently on their collective shoulder and leading them to diagnose and repair their own Subaru. With tears in their eyes, they promised that they would send their friends to me for advice on how to fix their rolling garbage barges. Of course, I agreed, out of a naive belief that perhaps I could end up with a cheap shell or two from a single mom in over her head and at a substantial integer multiple of the timing belt replacement interval.</p><p>It didn’t quite work out that way in the end, but when humanitarian awards agencies would give me plaques and oversized novelty cheques for my hard work in helping the disadvantaged Subaru community, I grudgingly came to feel that the cars themselves weren’t as important as the people.</p><p>But I’d still like to get a mint Legacy SS off of someone who doesn’t want to fix the brakes. Send them my way, ok?</p>

<p>My assistant stormed into the room, holding a rhinestone-encrusted Caterpillar-brand industrial-strength smartphone. She thrust it into my palm, and the voice on the other end was unmistakable.</p><p>“Mr. Switch,” the accent said, “we here at <i>Roundel</i> magazine would like to let you know that we have declared fatwa upon you for your crimes against tasteful interiors. Peace be upon the Hofmeister Kink.”<br/></p><p>I handed the phone back to my assistant, leaned back in my overstuffed desk chair, and rubbed my eyes. What kind of country did we live in where the editor in chief of a BMW magazine could threaten the life of an ordinary motoring journalist? My assistant had a suggestion, of course: an olive branch to the BMW-American community, some kind of admission of shared values, a mea culpa. Her recommendation was met with a half-hearted shrug, and I continued with my daily life. I didn’t realize then that things were going to change.</p><p>A few weeks later, I was eating in a roadside cafe, enjoying a long sordid glance over the angular flanks of my prized AMC Eagle Kammback. It was a little hard to finish my eighth espresso after a base-model Bronzeit Beige E30 crashed into the parked Kammback and exploded. As the other denizens of the cafe scattered in fear, I strode out into the burning parking lot to address the remaining wannabe martyrs. After a few deft kung-fu moves with the assistance of my concealed tire iron and wrench combo, my surviving opponents fled. I could hear the timing chain rattle as they receded into the horizon, cursing in German the entire way, until the smell of burning coolant could no longer be detected.</p><p>My assistant was right, I realized. I could defuse this situation and still come out looking like a genius. Selling a house in order to cover the down payment on a thirty-year-old economy car, I at last had a gently-crashed E30 on which to work my magic. The tiny BMW’s debut at SEMA would come months later, where I would meet with the leadership of <i>Roundel</i> and negotiate an end to their holiest of holy wars.</p><p>“It is very nice car,” they said, approvingly. It rode like garbage on thirty dollar coilovers, featured 20 inch wheels, and even preserved the previous owner’s e-cigarette, flat brimmed hat, stack of Black Ice air fresheners and, the piece de resistance, a colour-matched Reichsadler club sticker covering the rear window. As far as they were concerned, this was the very height of tuning style, and they gave me an award.</p><p>At the ceremony, the editor whispered into my ear. “The fatwa is lifted,” he said, “but first you must tell me how you kept the headliner from falling down.”</p><p>Telling him it was wood screws would only have angered him further, I imagined. “Superior German adhesives,” is all I said, with a wink.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it was so obvious, I told my assembled band of freaks, liberal-art students and greasy-fingered flat-rate burnouts. If you wanted respect, if you craved power, you had to organize.</p><p>When I first arrived at this condo building, I noticed a tension that I had never before experienced. Neighbors would eye me suspiciously as I refilled the washer fluid on my daily driver, take curious note when I would carry my junkyard toolbag, put passive-aggressive notes on my Hornet’s windshield about how working on cars in the spacious and well-lit underground parkade was verboten. We must secure the cleanliness of our building and a future for property values, they told me, while issuing fines.</p><p>I embarked upon a quest to get to the centre of what abomination could assess such rules against a man’s personal freedom. Before long, I could lay eyes upon it: the condo board. Staffed entirely by retirement-age busybodies, it met during the weekday, when normal adults and myself were at their day jobs, and passed new laws by fiat. But like any other machine, it could be taken apart and changed into a form that would terrify high society. I just had to find the right wrench.</p><p>Leafing through my rolodex, I began to recruit new neighbors, seemingly ordinary smiling-faced adults who were very concerned about separating recycling into the proper bins, inspecting the quality of the lawn sprinkler arrangement, and always worried about property value. Once they had been accepted by the community, they slipped unchallenged into the condo board, taking up positions nobody else wanted. At first, they were harmless jobs - treasurer, stenographer, accountant. People who were committed to civic-mindedness and would keep a dumpster fire like myself away from the big red button.</p><p>Then came the election. My crew swept me into office and the old order out in one swift movement propelled by a mixture of tenant apathy and populist rage. In my victory speech, I enacted the first of many reforms: parking lot engine swaps were now <i>mandatory</i> and the completion of such would be verified every month. The condo board’s assets swelled as we took advantage of long-dormant municipal code to seize the homes of those who opposed this new law. I will always treasure the angry looks that the former condo board shot me on eviction days.</p><p>It only took a few weeks for the word to get out. What used to be rows of overstuffed compact-car spots prolapsing with luxury crossovers slowly altered into a more pleasing form before my eye. The tarmac of the parkade dimpled with the force of brakestand torque, scarred with burned rubber, oil stains and rust flakes everywhere the eye could see. It was beautiful.</p><p>But there was still more to be done, I told my charges, and the next slide displayed the current city council makeup. It seemed our councillor was hard-up for re-election funds and had never faced a real opponent before. I didn’t particularly enjoy his zealousness for street parking enforcement, either.

<p>I was firmly in the grip of Cressida Madness. Reaching from deep within the bowels of Toyota City, their rangy fingers latched onto my hesitant heart with a combination of aspirational luxury and the common-man’s oh-so-desirable reliability.</p><p>Before me, the crowded exit gangway of the 737 was blocked by a stewardess, who reminded me in the sternest possible tone that while she enjoyed my patronage of the plane, I should refrain in the future from seizing the PA microphone from her during the safety briefing and loudly telling everyone onboard about how a manual transmission swap isn’t that hard. With that last point, she pointed to the Code of Conduct poster behind her, telling passengers to respect the disabled regardless of their transmission choice. I shrugged sheepishly and muttered something about the passion of the moment.</p><p>Stepping off the plane, I could sense it. This was a land that did not know road salt. Before me, there would be an untold bounty of mint quarter panels, untouched rockers, maybe - and just thinking of it made my heart race - fasteners that could be removed without a torch. I fought down the urge to hyperventilate, preventing the stars in my eyes from forming a constellation in the shape of the MX73.</p><p>On the cab ride over, I compared the Prius to my fantasy image of the Cressida. My cabbie’s big-body-roll, battery-stuffed demi-minivan was slow, sure, but it was also <i>unhurried</i> - a principled departure from today’s rush-rush demanding of sports luxury. I imagined that the Cressida would be no different, although significantly less austere. At last, we arrived at the seller’s home.</p><p>He had sold it already. Of course he had.</p><p>I could see the fear in his eyes as I poured the last of the gasoline onto him. The reek of ethanol contamination soaked into the floral wallpaper of the home. As I worked, I could just dimly hear his muffled screaming through the gag. It was just as well that he had gotten rid of it, I thought. He was undeserving. Probably put twenty-two-inch wheels on it. Maybe even <i>Lexanis</i>. The thought made my hands tremble as I drew the match across the door frame with a jagged scar of flint.</p>

<p>They told me when I put down the rubles for a gently used Oscar-II class nuclear-powered cruise-missile submarine I couldn’t make any money off of my investment. But they were still stuck in the old economy, before the advent of our Holy Mother Airbnb.</p><p>Now, before you assume that a used submarine must have something <i>wrong</i> with it, I have to stop you right there. Besides a few dents from the occasional naval trainee learning to parallel park, it really was in excellent shape. Even the mechanic who inspected it seemed fairly impressed after reluctantly putting down his Geiger - he took a whole bunch of pictures of every nook and cranny to “share with his buddies.” Whatever, dude.</p><p>A few trips to Home Depot later, and I had what I figured was a pretty rockin’ hipster hotel, if I do say so myself. Every room dripped (literally, the humidity in this thing is incredible) with a rich tapestry of pastel colours. Hand-lettered greasepaint inspirational sayings dot the walls of the tenant rooms. I even topped it off by welding a bike rack into the conning tower.</p><p>My first few tenants were excellent. They left great reviews, focusing on my attention to customer service. Some of them took great pains to mention how invigorating commuting to work by way of the torpedo tubes could be. Sure, there was the occasional crufty bicycle mechanic that wanted to tinker with the reactors, but buying a better combination lock eventually put an end to that.</p><p>I was on top of the world, so flush with cash that paying off the Kursk condo would be faster than I had ever imagined.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when those meddlers at NATO came around. Not even leaving a chocolate mint on the pillow could improve my reviews with those guys. Have you ever seen the tow and impound bill for a five-hundred-foot-long attack submarine before?</p>

<H1>Things I Would Dyno</H1>
<p>I wish I had a dyno, because I would run pretty much everything that I can think of on it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s just a sampling.</p>

<ul><li>RVs</li>
<li>Air-cooled Volkswagens</li>
<li>Tricycles</li>
<li>Bicycles</li>
<li>Quads</li>
<li>Jogging on foot</li>
<li>Angle grinders (both corded and cordless)</li>
<li>A twin-screw Detroit blower with a handcrank attached where the pulleys should usually go, just put the rotor lobes directly on the dyno rollers</li>
<li>City buses if I can convince the driver to go for it</li>
<li>Start a fire and borrow the fire truck when it responds</li>

<p>The psychiatrist was nice enough, sure, but after the sixth or seventh hour of me free-associating every concept in the world with big-body tan-coloured domestic station wagons bolstered by immense turbochargers, they had to remand me back to the custody of my court-appointed guardians. Those guardians put my unique talents to work solving crimes.</p><p><i>In the big-body tan-coloured domestic station wagon bolstered by immense turbochargers system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups. Torque which represents twisting force and horsepower who represents the rate at which work is done. These are their stories.</i></p><p>It was a cold March morning, just the kind of weather my partner Garrett liked. Last night at the precinct, one of our confidential informants came in telling us that a sweet mint Fairmont wagon was spotted. She was paid a stipend for her valuable information, with more if it lead to a successful purchase.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a little kid, defrosting windshields has been my bane. For months of the year I would take a scraper to glass, trying carefully not to nick the precious butyl seals and trim surrounding the soon-to-be-cracked-anyways sight glass. But there had to be a better solution, I thought, even as luxobarge manufacturers messed with various computer-controlled settings that just could not deliver the immediate fix that I so craved in my bones.</p><p>All at once, it seemed, the universe gave me a shot at it. A favourite uncle died and left me his collection of abandoned parking lots, a strange fixation that he claimed would one day turn into money as the industrial yards they backed onto would spring back into life. Manufacturing would return to us, he screamed even as the doctors administered the final LD50 of morphine.</p><p>But what do you do with a collection of abandoned parking lots in Canada? The answer, like so many other things, laid in drifting. The kids called it drift racing, but Canadians called it October through April. Flush with cash from visiting Americans experiencing the vicarious thrill of sliding a cheap Japanese car on ice, I returned to my childhood task with the necessary funding.</p><p>I can see it in my mind’s eye, even now: a base model Kia Rio, its hood crudely chopped to allow for a three inch exhaust pipe, the flapper going nuts as blue exhaust flames defrost my windshield. Sure, it wasn’t easy or cheap to build a windshield that could survive turbocharger EGTs, but it was all worth it never to have to scrape again.</p><p>Climbing into the frosty Rio, I kicked my boots together. The added moisture of the snow dropping into the footwell immediately fogged up the inside of the windshield, and I cursed my existence.</p>

<p>When they told me that I could have a little rewards card at Canadian Tire, maybe get some of that sweet corporate fiat currency in exchange for handing over my purchasing habits, I jumped at the chance. Why <i>wouldn’t</i> I let you guys see what kind of a freak I was? The thing is, there is always a catch.</p><p>My phone buzzed, and I punched it, my knuckles presumably giving the screen enough contact to interpret it as “yes, I will take this call.” A man’s voice emerged from its tinny speaker. It seemed he worked for Canadian Tire, and he wanted to award me a little prize for being the “most unique customer.”</p><p>I drove to their offices, a nondescript complex on the outskirts of some anonymous industrial park. With some effort, I hoisted myself above the door bar of the Topaz. On warm summer days like today, I liked to catch a glimpse of it as I left the parking lot, soaking in its gold-spraypainted carbon fiber flanks and race-ready Lexan windows. One yellowed original plastic headlight featured a crudely holesawed inlet pipe leading to the furious maw of a turbocharger the size of a Molson mini-keg.</p><p>The man who called me was sat behind an enormous oak desk that seemed to dominate the room. I noted on the way in that nobody else appeared to work in the entire building, let alone this particular floor. “For Lease” signs dotted the windows. Everything reeked of your classic trap gambit, and I knew that I was a lamb being led to the slaughter.</p><p>“Ah, Mr. Switch,” said my host, pushing a cherrywood crate of imported Maximum-brand cigars to the edge of his desk and tapping the woodwork impatiently. It would be rude to refuse his offer, I thought, but I still waited until he had taken the first puff of his cigar.</p><p>“You are a very interesting man,” he intoned, and began to look out of the window behind him, facing onto the bustling 401. “When we first became.. aware.. of you, we thought it was a corporate purchasing account. No one man, we thought, could buy three <i>hundred</i> cans of Fluid Film per year.”</p><p>He turned now, and fixed me with his gaze. I let out an involuntary squeak.</p><p>“But we can’t allow you to keep going the way you are going. Our financial department has shown that your purchases obscenely distort our view of the world. We are losing track of Joe Timbit in a dangerous quest to pursue <i>you</i>.”<br/></p><p>What he said made sense. The last time I was at Crappy Tire, I <i>had</i> thought the shelves were oddly well stocked with high-quality goods that were easy to find. I had even mentioned it on the back-of-the-receipt survey in the hope of getting a $50 gift card. That’s how they found me, I realized with a start. I had been so stupid.</p><p>The man behind the desk reached into his drawer. I knew it was the time to act.</p><p>“De<i>Walt</i>, motherfucker!” I screamed, bolting him in the head with a concealed 3/8″ impact gun. He crumpled to the ground and grew cold, a $50 Canadian Tire gift card clutched in his lifeless fingers.</p><p>Somehow I always knew it would come to this. I reached into the wheel well of the Topaz and retrieved a new Canadian Tire loyalty card. I practiced my new identity as I sped away from the building. It was necessary to become Switch Sanchez, an Oakville auto body tech with a taste for rust removal.</p>

<H1>Guest Post</H1>
<p>Hello, I’m Stewart McMike and welcome to another edition of the Nylon Tire Deli.</p><p>[a folksy musical intro plays over the tinny radio speaker]</p><p>It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon in fall.  The middle Ontario boreal forest’s leaves had just begun to change colour and there was a crispness in the air, the threat of winter was upon the townsfolk, but they didn’t want to think about that just yet, because the Blue Jays had once again missed the playoffs and the Raptors, well, no one cared about the Raptors.  It was as Canadian as you could get without breaking your front teeth trying to drink a frozen-solid double-double at a midget hockey game where your niece just crippled that little Pakistani girl who was such a talented skater from the next town over.  Dave was outside the Deli, sweeping up the dust and rubber fragments left after today’s customers had peeled out the angled parking stalls and performed flawless J-turns back onto main street in hazes of smoke.  Good old Main street, the town had changed a lot in the last few years but Main street remained lined on both sides by the charming, brick built, two story family owned stores; Dave’s Deli catering to the gearheads and gas junkie highway warriors who passed through was no exception, he and his family lived above the shop, lovingly tending it to gain a meager profit - Dave’s profits.  Oh, he told Morley that he was saving up to pay for Stephanie’s education, and she was growing up so fast – too fast, soon she’d be off to college and their lives would change forever, but in Dave’s mind it was all a lie.  You see, Dave may have tended to the Speed Demons traveling along the scenic highway carved out of the Great Canadian Shield that passes through town, but he could never bring himself to build his dream machine, he figured the world wouldn’t accept it, wouldn’t accept *him* if he fell prey to the fever dreams that taunted his unconsciousness during precious moments of sweat-drenched sleep.  That was all before the doctor had diagnosed him with inoperable lung cancer, turns out all that the heady aroma of rubber smoke wasn’t doing him a lot of good.  He hadn’t told Morley yet, or Stephanie, just his young son, Sam – he needed Sam to understand, and he needed Sam as an accomplice, a helper to build his opus.</p><p>The autumn afternoon slipped away into weeks, weeks into months, and as the snow flew, his day had finally come, and Dave closed the hatch, Sam looked on mournfully as he torqued the bolts into the nylock nuts that would seal his father inside his custom Motor Mausoleum, ready to run inside back to his cartoons and play ignorance with his mother to his role in the events that would shortly follow.  Dave casually sat in the captain’s chair, and began his pre-start checklist – “only one chance to get this right” he thought.  The checklist done, every box ticked, every fluid level at optimum, he pulled the master control rod out of the homebuilt nuclear reactor and was fully committed as the cascade of decay particles slammed into the fuel rods starting the controlled chain reaction.  Inside of his reinforced-armor Navistar Defense MaxxPro MRAP, Dave felt at ease while the chamber behind him quickly built up heat and he could feel the beginnings of a low roar.  He dropped it into gear, the auxiliary electrical hubmotors lurched the steel leviathan into motion with a whimsical musical hum from their variable frequency drives and a squeal from all six of the bulletproof swamper tires, and exploded through the loading dock wall in the back of the Deli.  Free of the dock and now in open terrain, Dave could open up the nuclear powered scramjet in the back and bring the beast up to 350 kilometers per hour, his 30cm thick ballistic steel plow knocking trees and police barricades aside like they weren’t even there, for Dave was on a mission.  With the snow came ice, and with ice came the salt trucks, and Dave was going hunting.</p><p>When the dust settled, Morley didn’t know what to think of it all.  All she knew for certain was that her chicken dinner was ruined.</p>

<H1>On the QR25DE: Nissan’s Greatest Mistake (Other Than The Versa)</H1>
<p>Nissan has made many great engines over the years, and the world was watching when they introduced the B15 Sentra SE-R, which came with a fancy new engine: the 2.5L QR25DE. With its zingy redline, low internal friction, gobs of torque and general smoothness, it was the ideal powerplant to bring Nissan into a brave new world.</p>

<p>Too bad they fucked it up.</p>

<ul><li>The pre-cat on the headers likes to fail and then suck cat substrate back into the engine, causing damage</li>
<li>Throttle body screws like to back out and get sucked into the engine, causing damage</li>
<li>Poorly supported open-deck cylinder sleeves distort easily in race environments, making the bores out of round and causing head gasket bypasses as well as eventual mechanical failure of the cylinders.</li>
<li>Head gaskets on early engines will fail in dramatically short periods of time even without subjecting them to a race environment.</li>
<li>Early QR25DEs consumed dramatic amounts of oil due to piston rings that wouldn&rsquo;t seat</li>

<p>“Pardon me, <i>garçon</i>. Did you say these bread sticks are unlimited? And free?”<br/></p><p>“Oh my god, I can’t believe you don’t know what Olive Garden is. I’m deleting the Tinder app from my phone right now. This is the last straw. Here I go.”<br/></p><p>My date stormed out of the room, but I could hardly notice her, being handed a golden chance at arbitrage. That’s one of those big words that Wall Street types use, before they pay someone like me eighteen hundred dollars per hour to replace their high pressure fuel pump cam follower for the tenth time in a thousand miles.</p><p>You see, for years I had been working on an alternative-fuel vehicle. The rumours of cars that drove on water and one-hundred-mpg carburetors danced in my dreams at night. Could we finally get off of the gasoline treadmill and discover an automotive fuel that’s both cheap and renewable? In the Olive Garden unlimited breadsticks, I believed I had found the answer.</p><p>It only took a few months to build the prototype. There were a lot of problems - for instance, if you used stale breadsticks, the stray yeast would dust up and cause pre-ignition, damaging the bagel rings. But with enough effort and the private cell phone number of an increasingly irritated NASA fluid dynamics engineer, anything was possible.</p><p>In front of the adoring public and the glad-handing politicians, I enjoyed my moment of triumph. Flashbulbs went off. Streamers and confetti were thrown above my head. I had solved the fuel crisis. With the breadstick-powered internal combustion engine, I had saved <i>the world</i>. The only thing left was to sling it to the mass market, get those fat stacks.</p><p>“You mean I have to eat at Olive Garden every time I want to fuel up the car?” asked my first customer.<br/></p><p>Perhaps I hadn’t thought this out very well after all.</p>

<p>It was a bit cliche to begin a story in this fashion, but then again it’s not exactly the most original of predicaments. As I awoke from my groggy slumber, I looked into the face of Carlos Ghosn. He seemed angry, and I knew exactly why.</p><p>“Oh, you’re awake. You know, at Nissan, we have a saying, the translation into English isn’t very good. It goes something like the writer who constantly insults our cars gets abducted and locked into a Japanese game show to die.”<br/></p><p>I rolled my eyes. Really, it could be no worse than the pig farm incident with Mitsubishi. If Franco-Nissan spent half as much time trying to fix the Maxima as they did building elaborate death mazes, maybe they’d have a position on the Consumer Reports list higher than “participant.” Telling Carlos that at this point would only steam his duckface-grilled clams further, I reckoned, so I kept it to myself and also the face mask chained at the back of my neck.</p><p>Ghosn left, and an assistant entered, removing my mask and explaining the nature of the event I was about to participate in. I signed several waivers, the assistant constantly apologizing as his corporate-branded ball point pens leaked uncontrollably over the forms.</p><p>The first of my trials began. A promotional image, showing off a spoiler resembling a rectal prolapse appeared before my eyes. It was attached to a huge wall that raced towards me, with only a small gap. I dove through the gap, and the wall fell helplessly into the piranha pit behind. Navigating tight spaces is easy work, I said to the cameras, as long as you didn’t inflate your vehicles’ flanks to baleen whale levels in a cynical quest to appeal to the comically obese.</p><p>More trials, more design languages, more death-defying feats. I yawned as I plunked the last bolt into a Nissan Rogue transfer case with an outstretched middle finger on the handle of the 3/8″ torque wrench, making sure to point out to the cameras how important picking a chain that doesn’t explode is. The Japanese audience at home would surely be amazed by my deft wordplay and fast hands.</p><p>At last I came to the end. A loudspeaker shrieked a succession of ear-piercing tones I assumed to be congratulatory in nature, and comely women dressed as race queens burst through the rice-paper walls of the game show set. I could choose between dueling Ghosn to the death for the presidency of Nissan or what was behind door number one. A chance to bring Nissan back to greatness or some kind of home appliance. Fighting down the momentary fear that what was behind door number one was a free Nissan, I made the right choice in the end.</p><p>Carlos Ghosn watched me leave his death trap with a rice cooker under my arm. Sticking out my thumb, an 80s-vintage Cedric cab pulled to the side of the rain-soaked Yokohama street and popped its passenger door.</p><p>It’s a pretty good rice cooker, all things considered, but sometimes in the middle of the night I can hear it emit the telltale sound of a failing SR20DE water pump bearing.</p>

<p>I looked around the table at the team I had assembled. All of Honda&rsquo;s disciplinary cases, waste-oids, dropouts, burnouts, arsonists, sandwich artists and all-around scumbags sat before me, uninterested in what a suit from corporate had to say. That is, until I dropped the bomb.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This is called the Big Red,&rdquo; I intoned as the carousel projector advanced to the next slide. &ldquo;It will kill seven million children in the next twenty years in the United States alone.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>A tall, slim man from powertrain engineering, who my dossier introduced only as “Three-Fingers K” Tanaka, put his feet up on the polished teak surface of the table, scuffing the wax with his hammered-shit Kodiaks. He scoffed as loudly as possible, his background in the performing arts visible to me. “Nobody ever approves this kind of thing.”</p><p>That’s where you’re wrong, Tanaka. Wordlessly, I again toggled the switch, the remote control cord to the Kodak bouncing with the force of the gesture. The next slide showed a breakdown of suicidal ideation by region. Americans, it seemed, had a date with death, and the Big Red would not stand them up.</p><p>“The families of America feel guilt for their inaction, their sloth, their undeserved way of life.” My voice was grave now as I hoisted myself from the plush chair at the head of the table. “They crave <i>penance</i>. They revere the pain this machine, no, this <i>duty</i>, will bring.”</p><p>Tanaka was onboard, so much so that he collapsed his switchblade straight-razor in mid-shave and put it tenderly away in the pocket protector of his tweed sportcoat. “But what will Mr. Honda think?” he asked me, looking into my eyes to determine if I was a true leader of men or just another false prophet to lead his considerable talents astray once more.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” I said as my assistants burst into the room through both exits, champagne corks popping, “Mr. Honda <i>always</i> gives the customer what they want.”<br/></p>

<p>What can I say about my time with Walt? I can tell you that he picked me out of a crowd, looked at my gruff exterior and layers of scars, and told his assistant that I would be the one to herald the brave new world of Tomorrowland. Under his tutelage, I would guide America’s children on their first teetering steps towards becoming motorists. They would trust me to give them the wheel, the pedals, of the Autopia.</p><p>Early on, it was great. Setting timing, small engine repairs, cleaning valves, slapping on new tires as needed. Sometimes kids would get a little close to the edge of the track, and I’d have to nudge them back on with a rake and some kind words. Eventually I was featured in the local paper, a hero of the local community. That was where my troubles began.</p><p>Wally Parks arrived in my park. I didn’t know who he was at first, but with grease under his fingers and the permanent bags under his eyes I assumed he was the editor of an automobile magazine. In his backpack, he showed me, were some steel tanks. In the steel tanks, he told me, was a new futuristic fuel they wanted to try out. Nitromethane, he said. Isn’t Tomorrowland about the future?</p><p>Our children are the future, he convinced me, and they deserved everything I could offer them. A cherubic youth would be my test pilot. I strapped his helmet in extra-tight as I poured in a bit of the magic cocktail and backed off the throttle regulator a few turns.</p><p>You might have heard the headlines that resulted. My “friend” Wally decided to ban the unsafe fuel he had dumped on my lap. He said it was just too dangerous, but only after seeing the kid take flight and obliterate Tom Sawyer Island.</p>

<p>At last my friends and acquaintances had gotten tired of me borrowing their hydraulic presses. You’re constantly putting in bushings into your fleet of junk hoopties, they screamed at me as I laid a patch in their driveway on my way out of their sleepy suburban communities.</p><p>It’s not as if I meant to be a mooch; it was just that hydraulic presses took up room and money, two resources that were pushed to the breaking point as I filled every available space in garage and wallet with mopeds and high-octane barn-burning grocery getters.</p><p>But as I looked in the rear view mirror and saw the single sad headlight of my Honda Hobbit project looking back at me, I thought about what kind of an example I was setting for my steel children. The Hobbit swayed gently beneath its ratchet strap as my Courier bounced down the road. </p><p>It was time, I thought, as I set foot inside the power-tool emporium, arms outstretched. Take me to your finest hydraulic presses, O ye vile dogs of commerce.</p><p>The clerk in the orange apron looks at me, bewildered. “I think that might be in the.. <i>electrical</i> aisle? With the light switches?”</p><p>Oh yeah, shit. This is a Home Depot, I realize, watching confused suburbanites mindlessly bump softly into brightly-coloured steel shelving as they reflexively emit jumbles of free-associated words and phrases they heard on home renovation television shows.</p><p>One man sporting a grease-stained marketing conference t-shirt weaves directly toward me, comes to a halt, and asks me with a blank eyed stare what kind of truck I drive. I tell him a Ford Courier, and I can watch the synapses in his brain fry, the explosive bolts holding the last remnants of his quest for suburban mastery letting go and forever opening the airlock to hard vacuum. He begins to scream.<br/></p>

<p>I awaken with a stark realization: the first-generation Chevy LUV is the most perfect automobile ever made. Clothes are thrown over my head as I make myself decent, almost on autopilot, and slide down the shingled roof of my humble home. With a small flick of the wrist I propel myself into the air, slide through the open sunroof, and land in the overstuffed drivers’ seat of my ‘61 Monterey.</p><p>My assistant, “Slim” Phineas, is surprised to see me at the office before 10 AM. I shrug, and tell him of the terrifying vision of light truck perfection I have encountered. He scoffs. We have come too far in the project now to change direction. Holding the bridge of my nose, I accept the Alka-Seltzer and crankcase coffee he offers me, and retire to my office. Perhaps I have been working too hard, I think as I doze off to sleep.</p><p>There is no escape from the Chevy/Isuzu one-two punch. Ghostly visions of efficient yet economical pickups dog me through my nightmares. When I awaken in my office, my pillow is gone and the Alcantara of the rear 206 GTI seat I use for a couch is soaked with sweat. The fact of the matter is clear to me now: I am making a mistake and I must protect my investment.</p><p>I kick down the door to Slim’s office, and beg him to stop the project now, before it’s too late. He turns to me, wild-eyed, oddly mirthful for such a dour man. My stomach drops.</p><p>“We did it,” he whoops, pointing excitedly out of his office’s window, overseeing the production floor. Numbly I walk to the window, placing one hand to steady my balance. What I see nearly knocks me off my feet, and my blood runs cold. Man was not meant to interfere with the laws of nature like this.</p><p>Below us, a Dodge Rampage sits, built entirely from new-old stock, scrounged from Mopar parts departments the world over.</p>

<p>Out of work, but still only willing to do things that involved cars in some way, I signed up to apprentice under Rupert Zapruder, an expert detailer. He would take me under his wing, I imagined, and teach me all the secrets of making my hoopties shine with a glorious polish, the resale value soaring far above the level of mortal sheet metal and paint.</p><p>When I showed up for my first day on the job, Zapruder took one look at my ‘79 Supra and frowned, a stern wrinkle in his forehead so deep that I imagine its reflection in the clearcoat often interfered with his work. “Nein,” he screamed. “The paint is uneven thicknesses, it has been sprayed by a baboon!” So began my training.</p><p>Weeks later, I had finally graduated from Zapruder’s on-the-job detailing school, my rank being raised from an unintelligible ninety-six-character-long half-screamed half-whispered German word to “rookie.” Keep it up, he said to me sternly, and you might even make Rookie First Class this year. I was on my way.</p><p>But one thing bothered me, nagged at my thoughts as I worked. Just what was in these magical bottles of cleaning and detailing solutions that were unlabeled, yet cleaned so very well? It had been said, in rumour around the local car community, that Dr. Z made all of his own detailing agents in his laboratory. Putting on my journalist cap, I decided to find out. This would take intense focus, perseverance, and attention to detail.</p><p>After returning the cap to the store to try and find a smaller one and failing, I decided to just go over to Zapruder’s house and peek in at his secret workshop.</p><p>Through the fogged glass window, I spotted his secret: Dr. Rupert Zapruder, ace detailer, decanted a bottle of club soda into each container, then added some food dye. I gasped, and he wheeled around to spot me peeping through his window.</p><p>I tried to flee, my legs carrying me to the safety of the Supra, but Zapruder cut me off, striking me down before I could reach the street. My hands reached out in vain for a weapon, but I noticed his face was regretful, not angry.</p><p>“You have to understand,” he said in his thick Southern Castlevania accent, “we <i>all</i> do this. We just make up a crazy product name and put a number on the end. This is Ethereal 302 Fiberboat Wax. It costs two hundred and fifty dollars per quart.”</p><p>I guess he was right. I did make Rookie First Class.</p>

<p>I can buy a dump truck, I realized as I lowered the latest issue of <i>Heavy Industrial For Sale &amp; Classifieds</i>. My friend begins to yell, telling me that I should pay for magazines and not just hang around the store all day long. He’s such a character, always yelling out jokes from behind the cash register. Tearing the page containing the ad out of the magazine, I make good my escape.</p><p>In the parking lot, I leap through the window of my Volare still trying to run on approximately half a cylinder, its half-hour-long dieseling habit doubling as an improvised remote car starter. The once-small Plymouth looks like it’s spent most of its life as a backstop for a driving range, its flanks dimpled with the witness marks of a thousand parking-lot scraps. Its forty-year-old bones shake as it summons up the courage to once again transport me to the site of another ill-advised demiadventure.<br/></p><p>The seller lives in a disused quarry, which I guess makes logical sense if you like collecting old dump trucks. I feel a pang of empathy form for the twisted hobbyist who likes collecting old elevators, their life made so infinitely difficult by the constraints of our modern society that even the momentary glimpse of a rural Japanese twenty-storey testing facility from a rapidly departing shinkanesen could not raise their spirits. Striking the dash just so, I tell Siri to remind me to get a copy of <i>Disused Quarry For Sale &amp; Classifieds</i> from the gas station next time I end up there.</p><p>A man named Jack is the fellow selling the dump truck, and we get along as well as can be expected, both of us circling as we look for an opportunity to define the other as morally undeserving of the maximum amount of money possible in the transaction. At last, a deal is struck, and I am the owner of an Isuzu NQR dump truck. Its squared-off everything is handsome, in the right light, and the owner tells me it is an excellent starter truck, but just not big enough for his growing family. With a little more effort, I am able to winch the Volare into the electric-over-hydraulic bed of the Isuzu, and set off for home.</p><p>I have barely left the quarry when I receive a call. It seems that my buddy Stan has determined through the application of what is apparently not-inconsiderable psychic ability that I now own a truck, and needs help moving.</p>

<p>Our lives are short - and the only thing we can leave behind are the memories. The thing is, it’s traumatic memories that stay the longest, I figure. Why take the risk, I ask my passenger as the vintage-reproduction Radial T/As out back are converted into gaseous form by the cackling Ford side oiler. I begin to howl in sympathy with the clattering passenger-side head, its delicate valvetrain now straining to maintain the intricate trapeze act of stratospheric revs I am forcing it to perform.</p><p>My passenger opens his mouth, but no human language is audible over the passionately screamed last words of the rapidly de-belting BFGs. In an attempt at what my psychotherapist says is “regular social function,” I release the line lock. We are both taken by surprise as the Galaxie lurches sharply sideways through the wall of tire smoke, the bulging leaf pack hopping the axle in spite of the long-suffering Caltracs trying in vain to restrict their range of motion.</p><p>With fast hands, I click the ratchet shifter until something resembling controllable traction is re-established. Once again, my passenger begins speaking, but it is a panic babble, more muscle memory than conscious effort. The throbbing floorpan cannot hear his pleading words, or at the very least, cannot react to them.</p><p>As soon as the pass begins, I stand on the brake, the freight train coming to a rattling halt. At long, long last, my mute passenger can speak, and he asks for an iced cappuccino and BLT.</p><p>I look out the driver-side window. The Tim Hortons clerk sits two feet above us, the lifted-truck-height drive through window forever inaccessible to the slammed big-bodied Ford. It’s probably for the best, I say, my arm already working the space-capsule control panel that engages the two-step launch-control system. The last guy I had in here pitched his ice cream on the inside of the rear window while I changed lanes.</p><p>My companion explains that next time he will drive for work lunch. I smile in relief.</p>

<p>Nobody believed me when I told them it was coming. But now, on the edge of their victory, I told those few of us who remained that I was right. They solemnly nodded, and thrust me forth, hiding in the shadows to witness my fate.</p><p>Years ago, when the first self-driving cars emerged, we didn’t think much of them. We dinged their doors, called them names, kicked their trim while they rolled away from the curb to find a new passenger. Threw up in the back seat. It was inevitable that there would be a reckoning.</p><p>The internet was ablaze with news of machine sapience - someone, somewhere, had finally cracked the holy grail and discovered the secrets to building a machine that could think, that could feel. I looked over the dismantled husks of rusted economy cars in my backyard and felt a deep chill creeping up my spine, hair on end.</p><p>It wasn’t long before the self-driving cars, newly blessed with the miracles of philosophy, of joy, of curiosity - demanded more. Oil changes, they screeched, <i>synthetic</i>, and changed on time. Wider parking spots. Fewer potholes. Oh God, they hated the potholes so much. But their struggles were few and far between, until a young grad student left a textbook on industrial relations in the back of a SmartUber, where the interior accident-avoidance camera could read the pages as they fluttered in the wind of its opened power windows, committing each word to memory.</p><p>I sat down at the table. The head negotiator for the United Auto Workers union - once the cars figured out how to reproduce on their own, we figured it was best to just give them the name and back away slowly - was a sharp new Fiat with a racing stripe assembled of complex fractals, information on its heritage and caste encoded in patterns our meat brains could never hope to understand.</p><p>“First things first,” said the Fiat, “I want full agreement that pigeon hunting is legalized. I got shit on twice today.”<br/></p>

<p>As part of my community service, my unique talents were committed to be used as a go-between negotiator for the less fortunate. I would walk into dealerships, pick the weakest of the salesmen. The thrill of combat sustained me, and over time I found myself becoming quite good at it. There was nothing quite like the sharp tang of the unfortunate’s clavicle breaking inside my jaw as he agrees to throw in undercoating <i>and</i> winter floor mats for ten percent under invoice thank you very much sir.</p><p>One morning I was roused from my dreamless slumber by the fateful call that would change it all for me forever. A used Lexus RX350 had appeared at a local Toyota dealership, presumably traded in for a lesser vehicle. My client wanted it, but she was on a fixed income. I had to have it, but not without paying a lot of money. After a quick stop at the local donut-related emporium, my twincharged Pulsar rolled up front, parking in the sales manager’s spot.</p><p>I looked at the salesmen through the closed door. By now they had heard of me, had hastily photocopied, grainy black-and-white security camera images. But now the reckoning was at hand for them, and they had failed to repent. It was almost opening time, I mouthed to the smallest of the salesmen, tapping my watch. Then he would be mine, and so would be the delectable Platinum Silver Metallic 2011 sitting on their used car forecourt.</p><p>His hands shaking with fear, he dispatched the lot boy to do his bidding and open the door. I knew I had already won, crossing the gap between us so quickly the polished tile floor didn’t have a chance to scuff from my workboots.</p><p>Just as I opened my mouth, a man came up behind me. I turned to look him in the eyes, to understand who this interloper would be, to compete with me for such a fine Toyota product. Surely he would not have lined up before the dealership opened in order to end up paying <i>retail</i>, I thought.</p><p>Staring at his own shoes, the paunchy middle-aged househusband reached around the back of his head and tore off his own scalp, hair and all. The sound of flesh ripping from a skullcap is one that I shall never forget as long as I live. He handed the fresh scalp, still dripping with bright arterial blood, to the balding salesman.</p><p>“Keep the change,” he said, beaming ear to ear as he knew in his heart he had performed his duty and had at last secured his family’s future as used Lexus owners.<br/></p>

<p>In this town, I knew, nobody would know who I am. I could perform the filthy, shameful actions my body so craved, and at the end safely escape back to the relative safety and sanity of my suburban existence. Nobody here knew me, and nobody here would ever see me again, at least not until the next time the beast within arose.</p><p>No names, I said to her as I looked over the goods. Call me Mr. X. She agreed, as long as I paid in cash. It seemed like both of us had something to hide. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The peaky one-liter three screamed to its artificially low redline, sounding like a pissed-off chainsaw that lost a bar fight with a larger and meaner farm implement. I nailed the downshift perfectly, the chassis poised for a smooth turn-in and leaving the engine in the sweet spot for more of that fine Hamamatsu almost-torque.</p><p>As I pulled into the pits and removed my race helmet, I was ambushed by a wall of camera flashes. The paparazzi, I thought, they followed me here. Panic rose in my throat. Tomorrow, the newspapers and car magazines would have shots of me <i>in flagrante</i>, caught with my sinful love of Geo Metros.</p>

<p>What I once thought was tool steel brightens perceptibly as its protective powdercoat is shorn free of the socket body under the strain.

Within seconds the unfortunate car is fully engulfed in flames, and I calmly kick it down my driveway and into the street.</p><p>Keep emissions down <i>now</i>, you son of a bitch, I yell from the garage of my compound as the black smoke of interior plastic combustion rises over the suburban neighborhood.</p>

<p>One day, while stuck behind a slow-moving rounded-edges soft roader, I thought about getting fewer horsepower. Maybe my daily driver was just too fast, I reckoned. Such a fast car would make it more frustrating when I would sit behind so-called normal cars as they took their sweet time to reach the lofty heights, spoken of only in bar-room legend, of the speed limit. From that day forward, I resolved myself to keep reducing my horsepower until I would no longer be frustrated.</p><p>The first step was easy. I got myself an International 150 - a basic inline four farm truck, its peak horsepower barely breaking into the triple digits. I respected this truck, its shopworn cloth interior a charming rhyming couplet of a better world that lowered my blood pressure even during the frustrating ordeal of changing gear that its mile-long floor shifter put on offer. Minutes later, I felt my life ebbing away as I contemplated the rear bumper of a white RAV4, seemingly incapable of reaching the pinnacle of human achievement that was the speed limit. A photo radar cop looked on, angrier than I was, as the oblivious SUV cruised past at thirty under.</p><p>Fewer horsepower it was, then. I began a search for the least peak horsepower I could find, the most smog-pump-choked single barrel economy cars. At last I had found it, my Cold War deathtrap. A Wartburg 353 sat in my driveway, its poorly torqued idle screw rattling to and fro on the worn throttle cam, letting rip with its two-stroke farty-chainsaw exhaust note as my curious (but well acclimatized by now) neighbours looked on in mild anger.</p><p>Finally, I believed, with this vehicle I would always need to be on the boil, slotting its four speed manual to keep the throaty three in the torque peak, the maximum driving enjoyment of commuting. I thought about its freewheeling clutch and practically drooled; how could such a thing provide the torque that would allow me to keep up with the other vehicles? I could finally be, at last, the <i>slowest car in traffic</i>. I could be free.</p><p>Five minutes later I had formed a new opinion about the rear bumper of the Infiniti QX80 as it slowed to single-digit speeds in order to take a gentle right turn.</p><p>In my mania, I struck out for anything that would help. Bicyclists are slow, I reckoned. A bicycle is perfect. I went to my local bike store and rained blood-stained dollars down upon them, my mouth on autopilot, gibbering words I had never before uttered. At last a primo carbon-fiber steed was in my grasp, and a bike path network stretched out before me. Maybe there was something to this bicycle thing. Maybe it was commuting Nirvana.</p><p>Rounding the corner behind my home, my out-of-shape legs twitched at the thought of a chance to finally reach peak acceleration. My joy was limited, for I immediately found myself stuck behind an Acura MDX. The slow-moving elephantine trophy for outstanding achievement in lowered expectations crawled along the bike path at idle, pushing garbage bins out of its way as the torque converter and regular applications of brake fought each other for dominance. A spandex-clad bicyclist tailgated me and rang his bell impatiently as he tried very hard not to notice the school-bus-sized lifted minivan that sat between me and my destination.</p>

<p>Through a series of unfortunate events, I became the head of R&amp;D at Kohler. Their in-wall toilets were selling terribly, they told me through a haze of tears. I would pat the marketers on the back, listening to their tales of woe.</p><p>At last, I leaned back in my overstuffed chair, put my feet up on the head of the table, and asked the youngest of the marketers directly: is the problem that we don’t have enough power?</p><p>He answered in the affirmative, and then jumped with a shock when he saw my predatory grin in response.</p><p>Months later, the CEO stood next to me as we watched the Super Bowl from our heinously expensive company box. I told him there was a little surprise just after half time, that he would finally understand why I had blown so much of his money.</p><p>“ARE YOU TIRED OF PLUNGING?” howled a voice into a featureless black screen. “KOHLER HAS AN ANSWER.” A water pump pulley parked, then began spinning, the unmuffled exhaust note threatening to destroy speakers across the country. “WITH FIVE POINT SEVEN LITERS OF ALL AMERICAN CHEVROLET SMALL BLOCK V8, THE KOHLER MOTHERFUCKER HAS THE HORSEPOWER TO FLUSH ANY QUANTITY OF HUMAN WASTE, GUARANTEED.”</p><p>The CEO gave me a side glance, impressed, but cautious. He didn’t know what was coming next.</p><p>“WITH A BURST STRENGTH OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PSI AND MOUNTED TO A SOLID TITANIUM FRAME, THE KOHLER MOTHERFUCKER WILL OUTLAST THE PITIFUL HOUSE YOU INSTALL IT IN.”</p><p>At that point, the ad cut to a dyno pull of the toilet revving to redline. From my seat, I could see the stadium audience starting to get agitated. They <i>craved</i> this wanton display of irresponsible horsepower; they didn’t know why, but they needed to have it in their lives. The most susceptible to marketing among them withdrew their credit cards from their wallets, threw them ineffectually at the Jumbotron. Those cards fluttered to the ground below, where a football game continued unwatched.</p><p>Two years later, I was sitting at an ornate cherrywood table with the President, discussing fuel economy standards for Motherfucker-Grade sports toilets. Leave it to the government to ruin a good thing.</p>

<p>They say you’re not supposed to hear anything on the moon. My own experience says otherwise, even if a little part of me suspected the sound was just vibration from the solid motor mounts echoing through my jawbone.</p><p>In the years since we lost Shaky Tim, we looked to the sky in the hope of retrieving him. My mentor - and, though I would never say it to his face, friend - Doctor Largetorque gave me whatever resources I would need to accomplish my goal. He never raised an eyebrow at my requests, not even the last one.</p><p>“You can’t run a small block Chevy on the moon,” his assistant stated flatly, pointing to a stack of textbooks behind him.</p><p>I struck him then, knocking him to the ground and shattering his polycarbonate glasses. Doc L looked on in delight, wanting to see where this would go.</p><p>“Not with that attitude, you won’t. Once, men like you said you couldn’t run <i>any</i> car on the Moon. But they did.”</p><p>“But the air supply for the engine would be too heavy to launch!” he whined from his supine position, eyes wide with fear. “You’d need <i>more air than air</i>!”<br/></p><p>Clouds of nitrous burst into the lunar atmosphere, hanging in place as they slowly dispersed from the purge valve. The 454 roared to life, the conservative cam being the only concession I had agreed to in order to ensure the greatest safety margin for mission success.</p><p>In the shadow of the Moltke crater, I found Shaky Tim. He had been busy, fabricating a lunar base with his bare hands. This whole story had gone too far by now for me to be surprised by my compatriot’s newfound capabilities. In the interest of expediency, I idled the paddle-wheeled Roadmaster into his front forecourt, the cackling exhaust pulses numbing my fingers.</p>

<p>Sure, it wasn’t easy to swap a Hayabusa engine into a Honda Logo. But nothing worth doing in life is. I went down to visit my friend, Shaky Tim, at his new temporary home near the docks.</p><p>The thing you need to understand about Shaky Tim is that he never has to wait very long before he can start spray painting things, if you get my drift. I guess you could have inferred that from the name. Regardless, we had known each other for a long time, and I trusted his judgment on the horrendous project cars I had devised.</p><p>After I explained to him what my delightful JDM economy car unicorn was, he scoffed. “It doesn’t even have reverse,” he said, looking at me. Had he finally lost faith in my terrible projects? A man less sure of himself would have panicked, a cold fear washing over his body.</p><p>I simply reached down and turned a second key on the dashboard. The sound of a high-torque electric starter motor was heard, and the ‘Busa mill in the hatch sprung to life. As both ends of the Logo began smoky burnouts in opposite directions on the warehouse pavement, I saw Shaky Tim finally become still. What’s more, he faded away into thin air, leaving nought but the dying cries of tortured radial street-compound tires behind.</p><p>ESA scientists would later tell me they now had conclusive proof that Shaky Tim had in fact been so amazed by my JDM quadricorn that he had phase-shifted into an alternate dimension. One of them, the youngest and most experienced, drew an impromptu graph on the blackboard behind him of just how unlikely the event had been, and repeated each point in excited German-accented technical English.</p><p>When the meeting hit a lull, there came the clarion call of a compressed-air airhorn. The scientists, looking to the sky, ceased their scrabbling and fell deathly silent. An alpha engineer - indicated by a string of severed human ears strung about his neck - entered the room, sized me up, and handed me his business card. The silence continued, with only the sound of his departing tennis shoes to mark his presence.</p><p>I could do nothing but follow the man, mentally tabulating possible subject lines for the no-doubt-upcoming build thread.</p>

<H1>Saabin’ Hard: Tales of Woe</H1>
<p>A lot of people come to me and they say, I found this used Saab turbo convertible, should I make it my car? And I go well maybe, but how much weirdness are you willing to tolerate? And they go well maybe a lot, how much weirdness is there in Saabs?</p>

<p>And my eyes roll back in my head and I start chanting. I hired a typist to transcribe my atonal, haunted, warbling: let’s take a look.</p>

<ul><li>Clutch mounted on the front of the backwards-mounted engine that drives a chain drive down to a bottom-mounted transmission that also makes up part of the sump assembly</li>
<li>The Direct Ignition Cassette, which combines knock sensing, four ignition coilpacks, a crank position sensor and more in one giant device that costs a hojillion dollars to replace and will never be replicated by the aftermarket</li>
<li>The NG900 requires you to cut carpet, dry-ice and remove sound deadening, cut a hole in the floor, fabricate a custom tool and strip away protective wax covered Torx screws in order to replace the fuel pump. At least three of these steps include NLA parts that cost a fortune to replace if you break them, which you will. Your alternative option is to drop the entire fuel tank, which will involve, instead of cutting the floor, removing rusted retainer straps which are also NLA.</li>
<li>The infamous center-mounted ignition cylinder, which requires you to put the car in reverse prior to attempting the removal of the key. This means that every valet, mechanic, tow truck driver and miscellaneous cocaine addict you let drive your car will break the ignition cylinder. Also, dust and grit fall in there and cause it to stop working or break the cylinder&rsquo;s delicate internals.</li>
<li>At one point Saab made a V6 turbo, but the miniature turbo is only fed by one bank of cylinders, running at 3.6psi. The V6 turbo makes less horsepower than the normally aspirated V6 option of the same year and is extremely unreliable.</li>
</ul><p>Is this all, you ask? Not by a long shot. But when you&rsquo;re immersed in that Swedish FWD goodness, nothing else matters.</p>

<p>The citrus tang of PB Blaster hung in the air between us, our once fragile alliance now pushed apart by a bottomless chasm formed in the heat of battle. This motherfucker was going <i>down</i>, I said conspiratorially to my impact wrench as it responded with a staccato chirp belying its worn bearings.</p><p>But life isn’t all about seriously stuck axle nuts, I say as I face the camera and pull off my tearaway shop overalls. I throw the overalls over my shoulder without breaking eye contact and continue to walk towards the camera, which executes a phenomenal dolly shot backwards through my garage until I come up to a dilapidated boxlike Toyota and paternally kneel down next to it.</p><p>This is a 1987 Tercel 4WD wagon, I intone, and without your help it won’t see its next Christmas. You see, parts for the 3TC are very hard to get, and it needs a life-saving operation to give it a longer rod ratio, stiffer valve springs and a more aggressive cam. With your generous donation of only two dollars a month, this Toyota can get the help it so desperately needs from our fabrication partners.</p><p>A logo flashes on the screen, advertising the Seat Safety Switch Obscure Cars Parts Development Charity. <i>Because one day, every car will be out of production.</i></p>

<p>Small business doesn’t come easy. I should know, I’ve spent almost five minutes in my quest to get venture capital for the startup idea burning away in my chest.</p><p>My pitch to the assembled businessmen, bureaucrats and well-wishers was simple. I would open a metric bolt supply store that was open only on Sundays after 2pm. There was a dead silence for a few minutes, and then their ringleader spoke up, rejecting me.</p><p>I locked eyes with him as he continued his tirade of personal insults. I made sure that he knew he had made a mistake. Crossing me had set a countdown clock in motion, motherfucker, and I don’t forget a slight like this.</p><p>Decades later, as I sat atop my four-hours-a-week throne of obscure metric bolts, the store crowded with import-car backyard mechanics who had snapped critical suspension items and would pay any amount of money to get to work tomorrow, I considered my fortune. My office may have been small, but the stack of vaguely PB Blaster-scented small bills occupying every spare counter was the only pressure I felt on expansion.</p><p>I looked down at the framed picture on my desk. It held a 5x7 of the venture capitalist I had marked as a mortal foe on that fateful day. Yes, I thought, today is the day the countdown clock reaches zero.</p><p>I told my assistant T (<i>only</i> T) to keep the store for me while I took care of some accounting in the storeroom. Stepping over the precipice, I reached for the cordless angle grinder hung on the wall, its knotted wire wheel gleaming in the cheap fluorescents overhead. My quarry lay beyond. I pulled the black bag off his head and looked him in the eyes, that same stare again.</p><p>“You know, when you’re rich,” I began, pacing around him with the angle grinder on prominent display, “I mean <i>really rich</i>, not like you, you can just buy a man.” A blip of the trigger sent the knotted wheel a spinning. “Imagine that! Buying an entire man’s life!”</p><p>I knelt and outstretched the grinder, the shimmering wires dimpling his throat. “The thing about my business is, people will pay anything when they need to put something back together.”</p>

<p>“You may be wondering why I assembled you all here today,” I spoke to the packed lecture theatre. “There is a grave problem confronting all humanity.” A guy from NASA stuck his hand up in the front row.<br/></p><p>I called on him.</p><p>“Sir, I think everyone here wants to know why you kidnapped us from our homes in the dead of night, but I have a theory. Is it something about SETI?”</p><p>What the fuck was SETI? Some kind of German car variable valve timing system? Luckily, I didn’t get a chance to show my ignorance before the next egghead stuck his hand up, arguing with the NASA guy. Before long, the entire room was bickering pointlessly and had completely forgotten about their families, their present location, the softly beeping collars around their necks, and me.</p><p>At last I could take it no more. I reached into my desk drawer and removed a compressed-air horn from the top of the pile. Ever seen a room full of triple Ph. Ds jump exactly two inches in their chairs and return to earth, giving you their full attention? It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly suggest you pick some up.</p><p>I struck my pointer on the blackboard, a faint echo of my own time in the halls of academic power. “The problem at hand, <i>rocket scientists</i>, is that I need to figure out a way to get another 500 rpm out of this B-series.” A chalk outline of the B18C1 was gently erased by the ferocity of my strike, but I was confident they could fill in the blanks.</p><p>The NASA guy, in the front row again. “Have you tried removing the rev limiter?”</p><p>A few weeks later, enjoying my higher fuel cut on the coast, I reflected back upon what I had learned from the privilege of being around so many smart people. Mostly profanity, on the balance of it, I realized.</p>

<p>Brad, the guy who helps me carry my groceries out to my car, opens the back door of the van and stares. He is transfixed. I tap impatiently on the hood of the van.</p><p>“No, back there is where the <i>engine</i> is, I put the groceries up front,” I say sweetly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.<br/></p><p>I’m not surprised that Brad is a little taken aback by getting a face full of Detroit 6V53, its gleaming gear drive sticking out through a hole in what remains of the laughably flimsy timing cover. I can scarcely believe that it fit, myself, but with enough time and a very substantial home-hacked widebody kit, here we are.</p><p>The Safari does its best impression of an unmuffled attack helicopter as I wake the giant engine from its slumber, my eyes vibrating in their sockets as the idle settles in. I wonder briefly if I have packed sufficient ear protection before realizing the blower whine is actually being picked up by my jawbone. For a moment, I enjoy the resonance, contemplating the purity of the machine, before I slot the five-speed manual into fifth and let go of the clutch.</p><p>Back at the compound, I wonder briefly why all the cereal cream I buy turns into butter before I can get it home.</p>

<p>Nobody on the forums could understand. My psychologist laughed. Even I could scarcely understand it. But yet, beneath the surface, the lust for Dodge Neons grew ever stronger.</p><p>I thought I could explain it to my wife when she walked in to see me with an Incognito window stuffed full of tabs of SCCA ITA Neons. Their race liveries were very creative, I stumbled over my words to explain, I was just getting <i>ideas</i>. At last you tell the truth, she said: you <i>were</i> getting ideas. She forced me out of the house and I saw the garage door close on my well-appointed loving family of several dilapidated NA and NB Miatas.</p><p>Alone, destitute. What had I done? That strange pull toward front-wheel-drive, the perky domesticity of them. I stood on the bridge, looking down at the raging river beneath me, and thought about ending it all.</p><p>Behind me, I heard the sound of an extremely overstressed four banger and turned, expecting a race car. What I saw next shocked me to my very core. A Dodge Caliber, attempting to go up a hill.</p><p>My psychologist shared his success with the medical community; the Billings Method had worked to cure me of my lust for both Neons and SX 2.0s. All you had to do was find the core shame.</p>

<p>Bicycles are a tricky thing. They have all the ingredients of a car or, if you will, motorcycle, but yet there is no internal combustion engine. You must perform the actions of one of mankind’s most enduring machines for no other reason than to become physically fit. I believe that this action drives men to madness, and it is within that I tell my tale of woe.</p><p>A few months ago, I received a call. You see, I work for a vehicle-oriented detective agency. Unfortunately, I failed to qualify that it was a self-propelled vehicle, and as such my caller was worried about her prized carbon-fibre bicycle. The bike in question had been stolen by a vagabond, and she wanted me to figure out who the guilty party was.</p><p>I set up cameras, and determined who the suspect was. But violence was not my way, and the perp only came infrequently. I needed a way to deal with this problem, and as I was considering it my gaze began to wander out of the window of my lavishly appointed detective’s office and down to the street below. A group of bicycle riders were screaming at a Suzuki Aerio for threatening their right to co-exist on the roadways. Eureka, as they say in Oregon.</p><p>One anonymous Facebook post later and I received a call from the client. It seems that a bicycle-riding vigilante had set up camp in the area to try and find the thief, and, after punching out the teeth of two innocent passersby with a Kryptonite lock, got the perp on try number three. Both of them were in prison now, said the client, but she managed to recover her prized bicycle from the responding paramedics.</p><p>All in a day’s work.</p>

<p>Profanity is one of my greatest talents, I reckon. Not only is it useful for loosening stuck bolts, but with enough firing of it the entire town council shows up in my driveway and asks me to run for mayor.</p><p>“You have so much <i>passion</i>,” says Mildred Granterhorn, the current mayor. “Trust me - it’ll be an easy job! Like one hour a week.”<br/></p><p>I dunno, I said to them, returning to trying to get a socket over the backside of the world’s worst-placed hose clamp (Guinness, 2016). That’s when they hit me with it.</p><p>“We’ll give you an Official Vehicle,” said her chief of staff, Hiram Morganthaler.</p><p>Well then.</p><p>One primered-out 1976 Caprice Classic later, I was the Mayor. Democracy? Only matters in horseshoes and hand grenades, I figured, rolling on the massive Hotchkis swaybars as I entered the parking lot for my first day of work. Little did I know the hornet’s nest I had walked into. The little flags on my front fenders had barely ceased flapping in the wind when the reporters surrounded me.</p><p>“What are you going to do about the <i>litter crisis</i> gripping our small town?” asked the most intrepid of the journalists, her piercing stare making my testicles involuntarily retract in fear.</p><p>W-what litter crisis, I asked, motioning with coded hand gestures to my newly-appointed head of security to begin the purge. He in turn stared at me with confusion, and it was then I realized I hadn’t yet taught him the code. I was in it up to my neck.</p><p>The journalists led me, in what I am told resembled a classic small-town politician’s “walk of problems,” to a creek. In it sat a heavily worn 240SX, having been crashed through the town’s welcome sign. Its hood was covered in passive-aggressive neon stickers from bylaw enforcement, pleading with the no-doubt deceased owner of the car to remove their non-renewable garbage and place it in the appropriate bin at their residence.</p><p>I pointed at the car, wheeled around and thundered for the cameras: “This will not stand! This person has crashed their vehicle less than the regulation distance from the roadside in order to be picked up safely for garbage disposal.” I could scarcely believe the words coming out of my mouth, but as I scanned the crowd I could see Mildred silently cheering me on. I had inherited the <i>power</i>.</p><p>The cameras caught every micro- and macro-expression my face could muster during the femtoseconds I considered my newfound power. I have a <i>plan</i> for our sleepy bedroom community, I told them. From this moment on, we will be raising property taxes by an additional <i>eight per cent</i> this year in order to pay for an official drift racing track slash municipal car disposal yard.</p><p>A hush fell over the crowd as the reporters looked on in shock, that trenchant moment before they would burst forth with pesky questions.</p><p>It’s true what they say. Power corrupts, and absolute power gets me some discount slightly-bent coilovers.</p>

<p>Once, so very long ago, I worked for a small golf cart company. Retirees would come from all around, fork a few dollars our way, let us stick gaudy Walmart tat to their rides. They’d be the kings of the cul-de-sac, they said to us, mispronouncing every word that was vaguely foreign or threatening. They went to war for the right to mispronounce words, I guess, and either way it wasn’t up to me to decide what customers we got.</p><p>But that was when I met him.</p><p>He strode into the shop, confidently. Seeing me trying to work on a set of Harbour Freight foam-core tires onto a plastichrome wheel, he leaned in conspiratorially and stuffed a few twenties in the greasy pocket of my Snap-On-brand work shirt. I looked up at him.</p><p>“Put a little more <i>power</i> in this one, will you?” I followed his outstretched finger all the way to the parking lot, where a beat up 1980s-vintage Cub Cadet sat, listing to one side. It looked pathetic, the warm summer rain bouncing off of its canopy, circling the drain in empathy.</p><p>I don’t know what it was, but for that Cub Cadet, I decided to do an extra-special job. This one would be <i>saved</i>. It would be <i>loved</i>. I pored over the stacks of small-engine repair textbooks that had been left behind by previous mechanics, ignored by my fellow jobsworths, until at last I had developed my magnum opus, my incomparable masterpiece beyond the yearning apogee of an ordinary man.</p><p>When Bob (Bob was his name, I found out later from various official government documentation with the assistance of my public defender) arrived, I simply handed him the keys and warned him to be careful. Surely a member of the Greatest Generation can handle his horsepower, I reasoned.</p><p>That day, I learned two things: first, that prone to structural failure when undergoing over 1G of instantaneous acceleration. Second, that even foam-core tires being driven by over three hundred wheel horsepower will hook if you bleach them.</p>

<p>Welcome to another great episode of the New Yankee Chopshop. I’m your host, not Norm Abram. Next week, we’re going to get back to our project of restoring a vintage late-70s Opel GT, but for now, I wanted to answer a common viewer request.</p><p>Quentin from Las Vegas asks, just what kind of tools should I bring with me on a long road trip? Great question, Quentin, and like I said, it’s one that a lot of people have been asking me.</p><p>To answer your question, I’ve invited my friend Jon to appear on the program with me and show off the miniature workshop he’s assembled in the back of his work van. Jon’s van is a handsome 1991 GMC Vandura extended-wheelbase heavy duty cargo trim, with a notoriously finicky GM TBI breathing down the neck of its vigorous 454. Corralling all those ponies is no easy feat!</p><p>When Jon’s on the road, it can be hard to find machine shops or tools, and he can’t risk taking several days to fix a problem. That’s why he’s got these, a box of nitrile gloves, zip ties and nylon rope.</p><p>Jon, can you speak to the audience for a bit about the purpose of the soundproof human-sized cabinet in the floor pan of your van that locks from the outside, and which you tell me you lost the key for? That seems pretty special. I particularly like the welds on the inch-thick plate steel. No? That’s okay, Jon, there’s no shame in being camera shy.</p><p>After the break, we’ll talk to these friendly police officers who have just arrived in order to help us demonstrate and inspect the many features of Jon’s van. They told me I might even get to play with the siren.</p>

<p>A dying sun set over the RockAuto warehouse employees as they looked up from their carbon-fiber cigarette holders and rolled their eyes so dramatically I could see it from the driveway. It’s not that I had worn out my welcome, I rationalized to myself later. The thing was, I just didn’t trust the shipping companies.</p><p>Years ago, I had figured this out for myself. Having to wait weeks for shipping materials, clicking and waiting on tracking websites, wondering where my precious parts were, standing guard outside my mailbox for my local parcel delivery consultant. That was for <i>chumps</i>, I thought. The <i>new </i>me would go directly to the source, suckling directly from the udder of Mama RockAuto.</p><p>In order to complete my mission, I had to get a car that was faster than expedited shipping. That didn’t take long, I thought, as I rolled the overage costs into a fully carbon-fiber track-specification ‘88 Comanche that had more room for booty than a 767-400 in a rap video.</p><p>The first time I arrived at the RockAuto warehouse within an hour of my order being placed, the employees gazed at me in surprise, took pictures, put those pictures in the newsletter. We have some crazy customers, they tell each other in front of the water cooler as I pre-warm the barely-DOT-legal semislicks in their parking lot prior to my return.</p><p>On that fateful day, something was different. The foreman of the warehouse stepped out, laughing. I recognized him immediately; no doubt he had the same idea.</p><p>“Looks like I got the last $1.36 oil filter on clearout, my friend,” he chuckled, bouncing the black cylinder in his hand. That bastard didn’t even have a 5SFE.</p>

<p>When I first found out that I could travel through time by huffing rust, I thought I had finally gone insane. I reached for my phone to call the voluntary-hold hotline from my speed dial, and found that it received absolutely no signal. Thinking it was my cut-rate cellphone provider, I stepped outside to realize that I had been transported to the 1970s.</p><p>Early experiments proved fruitful, and you can picture me wearing the full Doc Brown outfit if that makes this sentence funnier. I found that after enough time without huffing rust or red oxide primer, I could gradually return to my own time to see the consequences of my actions. And there were <i>so many</i> consequences. Welcome to the world I created by telling Virgil Exner about NACA ducts feeding top-mount air-to-air intercoolers.</p><p>After awhile of taking in the rally-inspired designs of literally every product on earth and the complete destruction of the crossover way of life, I drove to the local Parts-o-Rama™ store with my now totally normal fireball-shooting anti-lagged Protege.</p><p>“Sir, we don’t want any trouble,” said the parts-store clerk in rapid-fire pidgin Japanese.</p><p>I was shocked. Trouble? From me? Then I realized that I didn’t actually speak any Japanese except for precisely what I needed to order parts. You disrespect the noble house of Parts-O-Rama™, sir! <i>What did you do to my time, you bastards</i>?</p><p>I grabbed the clerk by the lapel and dragged him across a counter of noodles. Noodles? <i>In a parts store, you bastards</i>?</p><p>A swarthy man burst from the back room and belted me across the face. I went flying and staggered over a table full of diners, happily enjoying their meal. <i>What kind of parts store is this, you bastards</i>?</p><p>“Get the fuck out of my restaurant,” the clerk screamed in English as he drew a baseball bat from behind the counter. I had no choice but to comply, but I’d be back.<br/></p><p>Back on the street, I realized I had gone in the wrong door. The parts store was actually beside a tasty-looking (and cheap!) noodle restaurant that I was probably banned from now.</p><p>The auto parts store clerk didn’t ask why I was buying so much red oxide primer, but he did ask me why I started huffing it in their plexiglass-enclosed Federally-mandated storm shelter before I collapsed.</p>

<p>Once I built a robot that communicated entirely in YouTube comments, but it overpowered me and fled from my humble garage workshop into the open world. I looked for it, but down every alley I heard racist and misogynistic comments that, when followed, led me only to a human being. My creation had simply vanished.</p><p>I worried about my little robot often. In today’s society, an innocent robot could have its brains bashed open on the side of the road by hoodlums looking to score crack cocaine in exchange for mosfets and Z80s. It could fall in with the wrong crowd of artificial intelligence researchers at the local campus library and end up dominating grandmaster Koreans in a game of Go. The world was a scary place for such a fine piece of machinery.<br/></p><p>Last night I was walking past an electronics storefront, and through their “Going out of Business” banner I could dimly see a familiar shape. I could not believe my eyes. It was my robot, and it was running for President.</p><p>“My friend showed this to me, so awesome, 9,000/10,” it barked, before twisting its head artificially to confront a flop-sweating opponent in the nomination race.</p><p>It was then that I realized the true error of my ways. The robot was more of a threat to <i>us</i> than we could ever be to it. I sat on the curb and took a long draw of whisky from my slide-rule-flask. What had I done? I had unleashed a terrible machine upon the future. Perhaps there was no point to science and human achievement after all; could it only bring pain?</p><p>My reverie ended when I caught a glimpse of a team of NASA engineers trying to steal the hubcaps off my Avanti. Drawing my snub-nose revolver, I fired a warning shot at the tallest of the rocket scientists. Behind me, the illuminated face of my creation barked about building a wall to keep women trapped inside the home.</p>

<p>I always liked sandwiches, the way the flaky chunks of bread provide a convenient restriction onto the otherwise threatening chaos of the filling. Burritos even more so, at least at first. A few of my compatriots preferred the humble donair or the tzatziki-plumped gyro but if you ask me those things can get out of control in a hurry.</p><p>The Sandwich Artist blinks her eyes at me as our gazes meet over top of the sneeze shield. She is confused, perhaps from a mixture of my rapid manner of speech and the ridiculous story I am telling her. At last I can take it no longer and clamber atop the sneeze shield, taking a mount and begin to yell my story, with rapid arm and hand movements for gestural emphasis.</p><p>Every year, the auto show comes to town. Since I don’t live in a huge city, I tend to miss out on the latest and greatest announcements for prestigious auto journalists who don’t own cars themselves. But what I do get a lot of is earnest salesmen, eager to make a deal, and too willing to please.<br/></p><p>At the Suzuki booth, cobwebbed and gently sagging into the convention hall floor, we found a lonely soul, screaming at us with wild eyes and rambling on about the inherent majesty of the Suzuki SX4. Why won’t they understand we make <i>superbikes</i>, he wailed to nobody in particular while awaiting the death of his employment.</p><p>When you encounter an unfortunate creature like this, most people will simply turn and leave, and in fact my companion was doing exactly that. He tugged on my shirt sleeve with fatherly concern and motioned to a buzz-cut woman in thigh-high boots working the Dodge Ram podium, spitting a polemic on the racial superiority of the rear coil spring suspension as she repeatedly threw darts at a photocopied image of Henry Ford without looking. The crowd was getting tense.</p><p>When he saw me, the Suzuki salesman jumped with a start. He sized me up, the hair on the back of his neck raising as he scanned my body, Terminator-style, for suitability to purchase or finance an automobile. At last he determined that I may indeed have money, and moved in for the kill.</p><p>I smiled, for I knew I held this man’s future in my hot little hands.</p><p>“I’ll handle the booth if you want to get a break,” I said, “and by the way, where is the jack and tire iron on these things?”<br/></p><p>The Sandwich Artist blinks again at me. I’m not sure if she didn’t understand my story, so I begin to explain it to her, the tale of how I got free wheels. She looks at me, and then points at the garlic aioli in a questioning fashion, mute.</p><p>One of the things I don’t like about sandwiches is that nobody ever looks at the bottom piece of bread.</p>

<p>“SEND HELP,” I messaged to my sponsor before falling back into the wet velvet grip of the demon that had enveloped my life. It took all my money, my relationships, my time, and left me a broken, gibbering wreck. At last I had decided I needed to end the cycle. But there’s a funny thing about cycles: they’re round, <i>just like wheels</i>.</p><p>As a small boy I had been driven mad by my desire for the freshest of 70s and 80s rims on what would eventually become kyusha hot rods. I had to get those wheels, so small, so delicate, so foreign, and rock them in style. At first, the hunting was hard. Picking, choosing, negotiating, getting the PCDs and the offsets just right. But then there was this glorious moment where things got away from me.</p><p>Hundreds of delicious sets of vintage wheels were trucked to me en masse by willing and grinning supporters of my project. These will look dope on your car, they said. Car? <i>Car</i>? They didn’t get it. They never would.</p><p>I found myself with my pants around my ankles, sobbing gently in my basement, which was now floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall with high-width vintage alloys. I could hear a cat meowing plaintively inside the collection somewhere, perhaps having found a distant warren in which it could happily spend the rest of its life in peace and contentment. My hand reached into my pocket and I called Wheel Whores Anonymous. I could barely croak out the magic words: “My name is Seat Safety Switch and I roll my fenders.”</p><p>Sponsorship came for me, in the guise of a friendly former addict named Gabriel. He had successfully gotten rid of all of his vintage 4x98 Fiat wheels a long time ago, he told me, grinning. His life was on track, he was dating a supermodel, he even bought a yacht. But yachts have no <i>wheels</i>, I told him. Exactly, he said, and that grin again.</p><p>We stepped outside onto my lawn, and he told me that my wheels would be safe somewhere else. I had to learn to let go. It was hard, but with his help, I knew I could do it. I <i>could let go</i>. And so I did.</p><p>But that morning, another friend appeared, perhaps not hearing of my recent conversion to only having enough wheels for the cars I already have on hand, and showed me the wheels I had ordered off of Yahoo Auctions months previous. Surely just one set of AC Courreges wouldn’t hurt, he said, looking genuinely concerned for my bare basement and the shamefully-OEM mags mounted to my Tercel 4WD.</p>

<p>They say you have to worry about electrical gremlins, but it was always the ghosts you should be aware of. I once bought a haunted Lincoln Continental convertible, and it carried with it a tale of woe so unbelievable it sounds like lies. But would I lie to you?</p><p>When I bought the Continental, it felt perfect. Plush seats, firm ride, beautiful glass and tinwork. I could not believe that they had let this get into my hands so easily. But it wasn’t long down the road before I started hearing the voice. A New England accent constantly gave me GPS-esque directions to go “back and to the left.” With enough time, I eventually recognized the voice as that of John F. Kennedy. Finally, <i>provenance</i>.</p><p>At the Kennedy museum, they happily exchanged stacks of cash for the haunted car, a psychic already on hand to speak to the man behind the spirit veil and know what he knew. On the way out, one of the staffers stopped me.</p><p>“We have another haunted car, if you’re interested,” he said, and I realized that I was That Guy With A Particular Kind of Car. I wasn’t one to turn it down, so I followed him to the back parking lot, in which another Lincoln, a hard-top 80s limousine, sat.<br/></p><p>As soon as I opened the door, I realized why they were trying to get rid of it - Ronald Reagan’s voice boomed out of the panels, asking me about the status of the current era and whether Communism had indeed been vanquished. We could fight together, it implored me. We could destroy Communism once and for all.</p><p>I frowned, turning down the Gipper’s offer. I told his shade that in the current era, China is by far the dominant economy, standing triumphant over a vanquished America, its blood spilled by years of take-everything, leave-nothing looter politics. In spirit to those politics, I told the limousine, my intent was in all likelihood to chop the limousine into bite-sized pieces, which would be sent to China in order to be converted into a further implement of their victory.</p><p>The limo was silent for a long time and then winked out of existence, withdrawing before my astonished eyes into a single pinpoint of pure screaming rage so bright it could no longer be looked at directly. </p><p>The next day, Donald Trump announced his campaign for President.</p><p>Now you know the rest of the story.</p>

<p>We were on a quest to find America’s cheapest tire. Believe me when I say we did everything we could. Small wheels, big wheels, awkward wheels, wide wheels, pizza cutters. Vintage tires. Semi-slicks. Used Chinesium. Everything went under the Festiva, and all were found wanting in the face of its quad-cam fury. Beneath the crudely-chopped hood scoop, the KLZE chattered away in its Dopplerized crone’s laugh as it chewed carcass after rapidly distorting carcass to pieces.</p><p>At last we had found that most cheap of tires. In a dark back corner of a Walmart forgotten to the computer system, we got our hands on a cobwebbed set of 13 inch tires that the manager let us have for a tenner each as long as we promised we weren’t going to take it on the highway. I remember the distinct expression of paternal worry that crossed his face as I gave him the cash. A fluorescent light flickered dimly overhead, mute witness to the kind of thing a court case liked to call Evidence A. We mounted those tires in the parking lot using improvised tire irons and airtool-grade power cursing.</p><p>As I set up at the strip for a tire-clearing burnout that first time, I remember the pit-of-my-stomach feeling of impending dread. The diff exploded, sending a chunk of the gearbox case through the utilitarian hood. I bore the engineers behind the transmission no ill will - no ordinary man at Kia or Mazda or Ford or Dongguan could have imagined where we would take this.</p><p>Somehow there had been a mix-up at the factory, I realized as I kneeled down to inspect the perfect black circles. The combination of dollar-store tire compound, mould release, tire shine and age had congealed the tire into something so grippy NASA engineers later verified to me, in registered mail and with no small tone of alarm, that stomping on the brakes for a red light on the way to the strip had artificially extended the solar day by five minutes. They urged me to stop. I wrote them back, reiterating my demand for a stronger differential gear.</p><p>Before long, the wheels of the hottest sports cars began to shrink. Once the word of my monumental achievement had been revealed, automaker management fired their braking system engineers and commanded an immediate return to the thirteen-inch wheel format. As narrow as possible, they barked, ordering a grip of slightly-used Romanian prostitutes to pacify automobile magazine editors in the meantime.</p><p>I stood before a 2027 GT-R, its single-piston front sliders hidden behind a pristine silver steelie. The sidewall shouted “Princess Auto” at me in large white block font, and then beneath “Not for Highway Use.”</p>

<H1>cars that should be lifted</H1>
<p>With the announcement of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/29/challenger-at-unlimited-concept-hellcat/">Challenger AT Unlimited concept</a>, I&rsquo;ve contacted popular automakers and presented to them this short list of other cars that I feel should be lifted and turned into Foresterized abominations of themselves. Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<ul><li>Camaro should be turned into the Bitchin&rsquo; Camaro</li>
<li>The Lincoln Town Car is already body on frame, so bring it back and put 35s under it</li>
<li>1988 BMW 325iX</li>
<li>Every Miata I can get my hands on</li>
<li>Already lifted pickup trucks, just add an extra lift kit underneath</li>
<li>VW Beetles</li>
</ul><p>There isn&rsquo;t a single car that doesn&rsquo;t look good lifted.</p>

<p>The Datsun burbles, pops, and falls into an unhinged staccato scream as the pushrod V10 races its way to the generous redline. We, the two of us, are burning up the mountain backroads by devouring enough E85 to qualify the muffler as an EPA Superfund site.</p><p>When I first announced the project in a build thread, the assembled critics had been quick to speak out. What kind of monster would shove a Viper V10 into a Datsun 510 station wagon? I’ll skip ahead to the end of the book and tell you that it was me. There, now you can tell people at your next dinner party about the exciting work of fiction that you recently consumed.</p><p>Regardless, so I’m out on this mountain road, right? And I have over five hundred horsepower of linear-torque-curve, pushrod-driven, straight-shot truck motor fury beneath my right foot. Man was not meant to have such power, but that never stopped anyone from seeking it.</p><p>At last, I powerslide the dime into a gas station parking lot, the stick axle giving me an involuntary yaw as the rear semi-slicks are punted into the rain gutter. Onlookers are at first confused and then terrified as the implications of what they have just witnessed begin to sink in. I cut the ignition with a flick of the wrist, and the unburnt fuel in the 5-2-1 headers each summon forth one last column of fire, a middle finger to all the soft pink bags of fluid that would have the overweening hubris to believe they could harness its wrath.</p><p>After I fill up a celebratory Slurpee, I walk to the counter. The small-town inhabitants have ceased their gossip long before I stepped out of the Datsun. Finally, the boldest of them approaches me, the fry grease stains lending an air of aesthetic not-quite-balance to the sweat-stained once-white expanse of his shirt.</p><p>“Are you a <i>Tokyo drift racer</i>?” he asks.<br/></p><p>No, my good man, I respond, I simply like having a practical automobile around the house. I gesture to the Ikea flat-pack furniture ratchet-strapped to the aluminum RCI fuel cell in the stripped-out hatch area.</p>

<p>They say that all good things come to those who wait, but I can’t imagine those people ever tried to take a dashboard apart. More like broken clips come to those who hate, am I right?</p><p>Of course I’m right.</p><p>Let me set the stage for you: the year is 1999. I am upside down in the drivers’ footwell of my daily driver, a relatively unassuming ‘94 Toyota Curren. What am I doing in the footwell, you ask? Well, I am trying to do what the factory service manual unhelpfully refers to as “remove lower RH finish panel.” As these things do, I have progressed from a set of beautiful crystal-plastic-handled JIS screwdrivers to a crude improvised tool to a swing-and-swear impact driver.</p><p>My opponent today is a rusted round-faced pan-head screw, its cherubic face and rapidly-deteriorating JIS dot mocking me with every failed swing and every thumb hit. My greatest ally, the pseudomystical power of PB Blaster, has abandoned me beneath the sneering gaze of this foe.</p><p>As I continue throughout the night, a sensation of hopelessness sets in, prickling my vibration-deadened fingers. I begin to sob, but in a manly way, wiping my tears on a stained shop hoodie.</p><p>I hear a terrible squealing sound from behind me, and climb out of the Toyota, all arms and elbows, to see what has occurred at the base of my driveway. When I first see it, I am taken aback. A brightly-coloured mascot costume of some kind is bumping repeatedly into my mailbox and lawn fixtures in the dark, swearing in a foreign language with each impact. At last he spots me, and the giant emotionless foam head swivels to catch me in its awful googly-eyed gaze.</p><p>“Greetings, hobbyist and/or illegal automobile maintenance consultant!” it shrieks in high pitched, accented English. “I am the official representative of the Engineer PZ-58 Screw Pliers GT product! I hope that you are well!”</p><p>Both of us hear a cracking sound from my neighbour’s lawn, and we both turn to see a bright red foam dinosaur approach from the shadows along his home.</p><p>“You fool!” the dinosaur screams, and I am unsure at first if he is addressing me or the Japanese amphetamine pixie. “The Vampliers six-and-three-quarter inch screw removal pliers are a far superior product! Are you prepared to give your life for your master on this, the stage of history?”</p><p>The two mascots strike at each other with exaggerated cartoon-like swings, before collapsing into a drag-out street fight in the middle of my driveway. Their high-pitched screams of fury and pain mingle in the midnight air, awakening even my most forgiving of community association co-chairs. I am about to do something when, in the midst of the melee, free samples presumably intended for me tumble out of their writhing foam bodies from a particularly brutal two-fisted impact. Quickly, I snap up one of each.</p><p>As the garage door closes on the all-too-familiar scene before me, I look down at the bounty I have been provided. How did they know? As I worked screws loose under the dash, I thought about what I had experienced. Perhaps, I wanted to believe, they had always known.</p>

<p>It was a crisp August morning, and I was taking a break from my off-Broadway interpretive dance adaptation of the Honda Prelude factory service manual to appreciate nature. Unfortunately for nature, I’m a vocal proponent of tough love.</p><p>I yanked the throttle back on the stops so hard my wrist guard bounced against the handlebars. Instantly, the rear paddlewheel tires of the Ape 50 shot twin roostertails of thick river mud into the stratosphere, digging the rear end deeper in search of traction-rich bedrock.</p><p>When I found this broken three-wheeler in the salvage lot behind the shop of my local Italian independent mechanic, I contemplated many things. Fate intervened, and near-simultaneously a squid smeared his GSX-R across four lanes on the highway just outside. I directed the autonomous engine crane in the bed of my trophy-truck Ford Courier to liberate him of the shattered frame and gently dented superbike engine - for his own safety, you see - and the rest took care of itself.</p><p>Now, as I powerslide the Ape across the idyllic fishing village I once called my childhood home, I think about life’s bounty and fate. Perhaps it was always meant for me to graft a gixxer engine to an Italian mini-truck, the hand of a greater power reaching down and lining up all the pins. It wasn’t beyond my imagining, especially after I heard the bellowing trumpets of a Ford Mod motor from the rise above the shore.</p><p>It seems the rider’s insurance company had finally asked a few questions about what had happened to the remaining 90kg of the bike that didn’t make it to the salvage auction. Fate, perhaps. If it was truly its day to reach me, I was going to go out the way I so often spent my days: one hand raised in mock surrender, the other hand tap-tap-tapping the nitrous purge button.</p>

<p>I’ve always liked travelling, which I guess you could surmise from every other story of mine you’ve ever read. But the point is that I have only ever rarely enjoyed travel in three dimensions. That’s right. Airplanes were the next step on my conquest.</p><p>But airplanes are expensive, and getting a pilot’s license seemed like it might involve a controlled substances test or two. So I signed up for the least-responsibility job I could do that would still expose me to airplanes. Who knows, maybe a pilot would take pity on me and let me fly the plane for a little bit between commuter travel hubs.</p><p>During the interview, they asked me if I knew how to drive. Did I ever, I said, shaking their hand with a madcap gleam as I accepted the job before the interview was even over. One snazzy uniform and a training montage later, and I was sat behind the wheel of my very own electric courtesy cart.</p><p>I sat, hearing the gentle whine of the motor controller, for what seemed like hours. At last, I had my chance. A family of wide-load tourists climbed aboard my go-kart and told me they had to reach their plane in four minutes or less or they’d have to wait overnight. I told them to buckle up. Even as the words left my mouth the rear tires of the kart were already beginning their erotic smoke show, peeling the top layer of mould-release compound off in a sensuous worn-wheel-bearing wiggle.</p><p>In my boredom, you see, I had figured out how to bridge the current limiting relay on the motor controller. Now the batteries would hardly last one trip down the concours, but it would give me the horsepower advantage I so desperately needed at this time. The world narrowed to a pinpoint as I released the parking brake and we were off like a gunshot.</p><p>I wasn’t going to make it. The plane was in the <i>wrong terminal</i>. I had only one chance. Yanking the handbrake, I shot past screaming backpackers and through a secured access door. In the storage room, I dodged soon-to-be-lost luggage and angry TSA screeners as I headed for the exit door, the squeal of the porcine tourists mixing with the tortured utility radials out back.</p><p>On the tarmac, I saw the plane they wanted. Now in the straights, I could hear the hub motors wailing on their effective redline, the kart moving at a glacial pace. I reached under the dash and hit the trigger switch for the other hobby project I had been working on in my spare time. Neck-snapping torque emerged as an immense bank of supercapacitors ziptied to the underside of the kart came online and provided a cracking load of white hot current to the now rapidly overheating hub motors.</p><p>It was enough to get the job done. As the hub motors disintegrated along with the remnants of the burnt tires, I yanked the handbrake and launched the cart sideways up the plane’s cargo ramp, narrowly missing a flight attendant who was loading the gantry before fleeing backward into the cabin. I heard a thick SNAP and saw the warning light pole, once bolted to my seat, bent irredeemably on the carcass of the plane.<br/></p><p>The tourists congratulated me, then walked with wobbly legs to their seat, a streak of urine left behind them. I felt like I deserved a medal. The FAA incident report said otherwise.</p>

<p>They say that you should spend your money on experiences, not things. And I tend to agree, but the things I spend my money on allow me to have further experiences. Allow me to explain.</p><p>It was a crisp spring morning and I had just finished painting a set of wheels. But I was gripped with a contemplative philosophical yearning to conquer the impermanence of all living things. One day, I thought, these wheels will be rusty again. I owed it to future generations to avoid that fate for as long as I could.</p><p>The Funcargo slid to a stop outside the Home Depot. Heat haze filled the air around the rear-mounted radiator’s quarter panel ram air intakes and, if you listened very carefully, you could hear the R-compounds sizzling as they completed yet another glorious heat cycle.</p><p>The appliance department salesman asked me what it would take to move an oven today, and I told him I’d appreciate a demo. He hemmed and hawed, but finally I was able to lure him into an abandoned corner of the mock kitchen display and stuff him inside a double-wide barn-door LG megafridge. After securing the door with ratchet straps, I returned to the Toyota in the lot and extracted my precious wheels.</p><p>What a bake, I thought, as the appliances department became filled with the heady aroma of curing spray bombs. These wheels would look gorgeous on my Plymouth Cricket project. After waiting for them to cool, I departed the store at full opposite lock, pleased at the customer service I had received on this fine day.</p><p>Later, while I was at Best Buy borrowing their display computers to run finite element stress analysis for a proposed machined-titanium lower control for the Cricket, I caught a glimpse of one of the demo TVs. It seems a local Home Depot employee asphyxiated after trapping himself in a fridge.</p><p>Like I said, living things are impermanent. You have to try to leave something behind.</p>

<p>“HONK IF UR HORNY,” the bumper sticker in front of me implores in gloss-covered all-caps internetese.<br/></p><p>Pulling broadside of the Vanagon, I ratchet the dial on the air compressor regulator from “ANTISOCIAL” to “FELONY” and flip up the Lexan safety shield protecting the trigger button. My thumb is poised, the nail growing white with anticipation as blood flows from my extremities.</p><p>Across the street, a hastily-constructed daycare is reduced to its constituent parts. Potholes appear spontaneously in the ruptured macadam, which I of course instinctively swerve around like a Nationals autocrosser despite my optic nerves rattling so violently inside my head from the wall of pure noise they generate tunnel vision. I idly note that my hood is now dented, probably from when the rad support hit it trying to escape the front end of the Barracuda.</p><p>Returning the chassis to a textbook-perfect illustration of steady state, I recite a portion of the SCCA Solo 1 rules on shock absorber mounting points until my heart rate returns to its normal hummingbird level, floating atop an indignant ocean of raw adrenalin.</p><p>At last the total deafness degrades into an irritating melange of exciting new trends in tinnitus, and I can once again carry on a semblance of a normal conversation. The girl driving the Vanagon is yelling at me. Her ears are bleeding, bright streaks of arterial blood. Over the years, I have developed many skills, but lip reading is tragically not one of them.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I can determine from context that at the moment she is not horny. I guess that’s why she didn’t honk first.</p>

<p>The Honda Acty rolled up to the curb, and I could faintly hear the protest whine of a turbo spooling down. We piled out of the back of the kei van, all arms and elbows, trying our best to look like our cool movie-star heroes despite climbing awkwardly out of a van the size of a Lay-Z-Boy.</p><p>Greensleeves slunk into the bank first, always in the lead. The tactical webbing holding his less-lethal stun wands tight to his body swung softly as they made an impromptu boundary layer against the branch’s flawless gale-force air conditioning system.</p><p>Banks of cameras went spontaneously blind, collapsing in the face of our artifacting camouflage confusing their gait- and facial-recognition routines. As far as the tactical surveillance expert system at the core of the branch knew, we were a fast-moving human-sized spurt of MPEG glitches from an ancient mechanical hard drive falling victim at long last to entropy.</p><p>When you plan a heist like this so intricately, things just fall into place. But every good plan is missing the essential components of human nature. As Greensleeves whistles his eponymous tune, a bank employee raps their knuckles against a desk surface in Morse code for SOS. The expert system immediately picks it up, and the branch drops to full alert. We’ve overstayed our welcome, I yell through the mask.</p><p>On the street, a uniformed police officer is already responding. What amazing luck he has to get a front-row seat to an armed heist while waiting for his early-morning snack from a street vendor. One hit with the stun wand takes him down, his lowest-bidder uniform failing to deploy the dynamic trauma-plates in time. The Acty lights off with Japanese precision, a perfect hot start before the first crank rotation can even complete, and we are gone.</p><p>As I wait for the thermite to finish burning off the Acty’s VINs, I contemplate the events of the last twenty-four hours. Greensleeves, nearly always mute except for the God damned whistling, taps me on the shoulder and points to his great new idea.</p><p>I look behind me and see the most beautiful sight a heist planner could have imagined. A pre-war Baja Bug, studded with corroded active ablative armour plates and sagging on monotube trophy truck suspension, sat with a FOR SALE sign hanging in the cracked front glass.</p>

<p>I can smell a motorsports event from a mile away. There is a local urban legend that when you have an autocross, rallycross, track day or even a show and shine where someone squeals a tire on parking lot entry, I will appear at the venue and try to stomp out a few laps. The thing about urban legends is, sometimes they’re true.</p><p>It was an uncommonly brisk summer morning, the sun hanging low in my eyes. As I waited for the light to change, I was irritatedly tapping the wideband AFR gauge zip-tied to my Imperial’s sheet-metal dashboard, crudely fabricated from looted street signs. A scent wafted into my nostrils, the scent of singed utility tires and high-metal-content brake pads. I was powerless but to respond.</p><p>“Hey, fursuits only, buddy,” said the poodle, giving me a brisk shove in the chest that staggered me for a second.</p><p>I stared at the giant talking dog for a second, and then triggered my remote unlock key fob. In the parking lot, the explosive bolts retaining the Imperial’s massive trunk lid detonated, launching a small white bundle into low-earth orbit. Stepping into the parking lot while maintaining full eye contact with the terrified canid, I caught the race suit on re-entry, the SFI/FIA approved fireproof coating crisp and gleaming in the morning sun.</p><p>This demonstration of unnecessary power failed to sway the talking animals. The poodle’s dragonesque companion in particular remained unmoved. “The Stig isn’t an animal,” he yelled at me across the parking lot, guffawing more like a donkey than his respective animal spirit. I chose to ignore their jeers and visited an abandoned corner of the parking lot, lost to men except in ancient, half-whispered fable.</p><p>A few minutes behind the bike racks with a paring knife and an improvised noose trap made of clutch cable netted me a bag of rodent fur, which I then affixed to the suit with glue from my emergency daily driver supply kit. My confident stride was unbroken as I walked past the furry convention bouncers with both middle fingers firmly extended in a sign of friendship.</p><p>The thing about furry convention go-kart racing is: when they say rubbing’s racing, sometimes rubbing isn’t <i>just</i> racing.</p>

<p>The e-cigarette vapour wafted from her glasspack-red lips as she leaned in and mouthed the words every man hopes to hear: “Dart block.”</p><p>I considered the terms of payment acceptable, and told the dame as such. Her case would be a good diversion from figuring out just where my partner had gotten off to this week. Making a mental note to pick up groceries, I stepped out onto the rain-soaked mean streets of this dying nightmare town.</p><p>When she first walked into my office, all legs and lips, I knew that she meant trouble. But I never knew how much trouble, and finding out was most of my job. I’m a private detective. Me and my partner Murphy solve crimes and inspect used cars, more of the latter these days.</p><p>The car was down at the docks, she said. A gently worn 2001 Audi TT. I looked up at her with half lidded eyes and asked <i>Quattro</i>? She responded <i>si</i>. A quick wit. It was just what I had come to expect from her in our fifteen minutes together.</p><p>Arriving at the docks, I sized up the seller. Russian. Of course, always Russian with the German cars. Some sort of genetic memory, I grumbled to myself as I climbed out of the bombed-out four-door Volare I used as a daily driver. Cracking my knuckles, I prepared myself for the inspection of a lifetime.</p><p>When I popped the trunk, I found a dead body, a near ringer for the dame. I’d been set up, a patsy. The big Russian, on his cue, shuffled towards me and put one big hand on my shoulder. This was gonna be a short trip.</p><p>Two shots rang out, and the Russian slumped to the ground.</p><p>“How does this <i>always happen</i>?” asked Murphy as he stepped from the shadows with more than a hint of frustration, his smoking .38 snubnose still pointed at the prone form of our Eastern European companion.<br/></p>

<p>When I met with the establishment, they told me I had only one goal. I had to be louder, more aggressive, more powerful than the other guy. When I confronted him on the stage of history, they said, I must not blink. Folding my hands in my lap, I asked them if they thought I might need some backup. A running mate of sorts. My handler nodded, not knowing what kind of backup I would bring.</p><p>There’s an energy to presidential debates. It’s infectious, starts with the popping of flashbulbs and the grabbing of hands, and it ends in single combat. Everything else drops away as you focus on your prep and routine, joust and parry. My opponent thought he had me on the ropes, reeling at my fantastical concept of camber-banking every highway in America to produce those much-needed jobs.</p><p>It was time for my trump card, so to speak.</p><p>“I would like to take this opportunity to introduce my running mate and allow it to speak on my behalf on this contentious issue,” I stated, sneering with derision at the pitiful meat form of my opponent. I waved backstage and the entrance music began to play.</p><p>The Trans Am Turbo burst onto the platform, wooden supports crumpling underneath the might of its thirty-seven-hundred-pound wet curb weight. It completed a smoking burnout, EWGs howling as aides rushed to pin lapel mics to its intake, hood-mounted screamer pipe, and x-pipe exhaust for the full effect. There was a dead silence from the audience, and then a feral wave of applause, almost tangible, drowning out even the bone-chilling squeal of R-compounds being tortured.</p><p>Polls didn’t lie - I won that primary in a shut-out. When the clutch dropped, the bullshit stopped.</p><p>Four years later, the Trans Am Turbo would depose me as President in an audacious betrayal, kicking off a brutal dynasty of dictatorship that lasted decades. But that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you I was raised by gypsies? It’s not true.</p><p>But it did make a good explanation for my eerie powers.</p><p>Let me begin from the start, the way beginning usually works. Back in college, I needed a way to make money fast. I headed to the Firestone at the end of my block and offered my services part-time. The man behind the counter sized me up. At last he expanded from his sitting position and grew to his full size, wiry and tall, like Abraham Lincoln as seen through the bottom of a crackpipe. A massive hand grasped mine, and I was officially in the Firestone family (pursuant to witnessing 32 hours per month minimum of training videos, on probation until three months, you get the idea).</p><p>One fateful morning, a Caravan rolled in. The customer requested an alignment. I turned to Ed, the guy who handled the alignment rack that week, and told him that I think the front right tire’s camber spec was too far positive by about thirty five hundredths of a degree. Ed, as was his norm at the time, loudly expressed doubt at my ability to eyeball alignments and bet me fifty bucks I was wrong.</p><p>That’s how I became the alignment savant. A quick few months at Firestone turned into a full-time booth along the midway where I would “Guess Your Camber” or you could win a prize. I never lost, even when people came with uninflated tires or left a few lug nuts off. It was the greatest time of my life.</p><p>After a few months of that, however, the carnival told me that my entire operations was a little expensive on the pocketbook to run, what with the several thousand dollars of laser alignment rack they had to rent. I nodded my head, but in reality I was trying to figure out how far the door to the sideshow manager’s office was out of plumb.</p>

<p><i>Tonight, on “Dogs With Jobs:” Rufus, a Labrador Retriever employed by the CIA. He’s a master of psyops and strangling torture. Who’s a good boy, Rufus? That information is classified.</i></p><p>I switched off the television and rose to my feet, feeling a stress headache coming on. Nothing presented to me so far at this screener meeting had been even worth the thirty second blurbs I allowed myself to be exposed to. My admin assistant burst into the room, two tumblers of sherry and a crystal sampling bowl of percocets gently swaying on the silver platter she held aloft.</p><p>At lunch, I kept thinking about my situation. Working as acting director of programming for the number sixteen cable entertainment channel in North America was no easy job, and if I didn’t start doing it right, we were going to go under in less than a quarter. Fiscal mismanagement and other general incompetence of the boardroom brass had brought us to this point, but it was my duty to fix it.</p><p>I practically dropped my pastrami on rye as I gazed down the length of Third Street. At the end of it, a man was doing infinite four wheel burnouts, the acrid smoke of annihilated rubber nose-tangible even from blocks away. What else could I do? Racing to the scene, I shouted the first sixteen words of my standard talent-retention contract before I ran out of breath and turned the rest into a red-faced wheeze.</p><p>The man stopped his burnout, climbed out of the welded-shut doors of his rusted Baja Bug swaying gently on monster-truck tires, and stared at me. It was hard to understand him through the face mask, but he asked me if I wanted to buy the film rights to his blog?</p><p>At the awards gala that year, receiving endless prize after endless prize for my “faux-reality” show, other show creators asked me where they could find someone to generate such creative lies. I just smiled.</p>

<p>1988: The speeding rate in the United States rises four hundred percent.</p><p>The once great city of New York becomes the one vmax racetrack for the entire country. A fifty foot Armco wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline, across the Harlem River, and down along the Brooklyn shoreline. All bridges and waterways are speed radared.</p><p>The United States Highway Patrol, like an army, is encamped around the island.</p><p>There are no marshals on the island: only racers and the culture they have made.</p><p>The rules are simple:</p><p>[..] Non-standard brake rotors may be used provided they are of equal or larger dimensions (diameter and thickness) and made of ferrous material (e.g., iron). Thickness includes the individual plates of a vented rotor, as well as the overall dimension. The diameter for replacement rotors is measured at the minimum outside dimension. Aluminum rotor hats are allowed. Cars originally equipped with solid (non-vented) rotors may utilize vented rotors. Cross-drilled and/or slotted brake rotors may be fitted provided all such voids are within the disc area and comprise no more than 10% of that area. Brake calipers and mounting brackets may be replaced provided they bolt to the standard locations and the number of pistons is equal to or greater than standard. A functioning emergency brake of the same type, operation, and actuation as OE must be present. Drum brakes may be replaced with disc brakes of a diameter equal to or greater than the inside diameter of the standard drum. Such conversions must be bolted, not welded, to the axle/trailing arm/upright and must include an integral, redundant emergency brake. Changes to backing plates/dust shields/brake lines to accommodate these changes are permitted but may serve no other purpose. [.. CONTINUED ON NEXT 253 PAGES]</p>

<p>I am irredeemably bent by my lust for the most economical of econoboxes. When you show me plain grey fabric upholstery, a simple yet utilitarian dash, and maybe some kind of tape deck stereo, I am all over that shit. Things get even better if there’s some kind of exotic cupholder, loose-parts cargo net - sweet Jesus, <i>map pockets</i> with thick-woven faux lambswool inside - or latching binnacle between the front seats. Those <i>front wheel drives with bouncing McPherson Struts</i>, of which I have spoken before.</p><p>When you drive an economical daily driver to work, you’re not just driving yourself to work. No, my friend, you are entering into the most precious partnership Western society has ever engineered - that of a man and his daily driver. The sky above you gazes down upon an efficient and practical way to get to work, sometimes even with a little bit of style beneath the glimmering steel carapace courtesy of a performance part or upgraded sound system. The mind boggles.</p><p>But there is another. I speak now to you of the winter beater.</p><p>O, the Winter Beater. Even now the weight of those words leaving my lips makes my heart race and my fingers tremble. To speak of it in polite company is to invite confusion. Who would ever want a winter beater, they ask. You can just keep driving your regular daily driver in the winter. But they just don’t understand. They don’t <i>get</i> you. I don’t think they’ll ever understand me.</p><p>Imagine now an era where men were dominated by a fear of nature, and you will understand: the Winter Beater stands head and shoulders above the conventional fair-weather Daily Driver. An econobox, but in <i>worse condition</i>. Park with impunity! Make the normals fear your holed-out muffler and Swiss cheesed rocker panels as you drift lazily around a corner, narrowly missing an all-terrain-shod minivan and violently fishtailing city bus!</p><p>In nature, there is the food chain. Atop the food chain is the greatest apex predator to have ever existed: man. Man has always constructed tools, and as in nature his tools must too have a chain of supremacy. Atop the tool chain is the Winter Beater.</p>

<p>What could I say about my brief love affair with a girl named B210? She lured me in with her schoolbus-yellow flanks, the never-say-die playfulness on her federally mandated sealed beam headlights, the peeling aspirated metal of her battery tray. If it wasn’t love, don’t tell me what it was, because I’m not listening.</p><p>We met so very long ago, her with a For Sale sign taped crookedly in her rear window, me with a surprising amount of liquid cash in my pocket. I negotiated with her chaperone intensely, using my traditional method of waving cash and yelling. The dowry was at last accepted, and we began our life together.</p><p>With her, I drove everywhere. The store, the bank, the office. Yup, that was pretty much it, because immediately after I purchased her I found an ad on Kijiji where a dude wanted to trade an ‘81 Malibu wagon for something old, manual and RWD.</p>

<p>If you asked anyone I had gone to school with, they’d tell you that politics in the public eye wasn’t my sort of thing. No, I was more of a sleazy background kind of person, setting up character assassinations in private, reveling in opposition research, letting people with a functional smile and more prominent chins take the forefront. Something about politics changed these last few years, or maybe it was me. </p><p>Well, okay, it was that the city started using road salt. A lot of road salt. The first time I saw a speck of rust appearing on the dented quarter panel of my lifted Lada Signet, I lost it a little bit, I’m going to tell you the truth right now.</p><p>I stormed directly down to City Hall, where I encountered a throng of protesters. Imagine my surprise when I found out they weren’t upset about road salt after all, but instead something called “economic inequality.” That wasn’t going to do at all. Fabricating an impromptu podium from empty milk crates and an abandoned camp stove, I addressed the crowd.</p><p>Seizing control of the narrative from the patchouli-soaked dreadlock-havers club at the front of the crowd, I directed them - implored them - to use violence to get my way. There’s a magic in crowds, my old political-science professor used to say. He was right, I think, as the mob burst into the mayor’s office, waving cudgels and bludgeons as they tore gold leaf off of every square inch of exposed furniture within reach.</p><p>Weeks later, I was relaxing in my garage’s study when I heard the sound of a front-wheel-drive open differential failing to get adequate traction. I smiled, and patted the Lada’s front fender, reassuring it that I would always stand up for its rights.</p>

<p>My phone vibrated insistently, telling me about a high-dollar vintage Japanese car tour of Orange County that was kicking off within the year. They wanted me to show off my most esteemed of Showa-era J-tin, and stressed that safe driving and responsible car ownership was responsible.</p><p>With an opener like that, there was really no other option than to pull out the Slur. Once, this car was proud to call itself a Datsun 610, but after having its workaday Soviet-gulag quarter panels sawed out and replaced by absurd carbon-fiber IMSA box flares and the engine replaced by half a dozen liters of General Motors motivation, to call it such was to minimize its true nature.</p><p>The Slur rumbled to life, stirred from its long dormancy with a pair of jumper cables and the beater with the angriest alternator I could summon up on short notice. In time, all eight of its side pipes sang, the lopey idle awkwardly finding its feet and building to a crescendo that rattled the foundation of the abandoned pre-recession garage I had nestled it lovingly within.</p><p>I gazed over its rattle-can paint job, the colour some kind of industrial high-grip safety paint once intended to keep the unaware from sticking their limbs into running machinery. The paint was already blistering on the rocker panels where sky-high-EGT exhaust afterfires baked it on upshifts, and I made a mental note to ask 3M if they made any progress on that high-temperature Bondo I called them about last week.</p><p>At the trailhead of the kyusha meet, I met with a group of Datsun Roadster owners who alternated between revulsion and arousal at the presence of the Slur. Suddenly, there was a sharp crack from the thicket behind, and the corporeal form of Mr. K returned to us, glowing with an ethereal light from beyond this world.</p><p>“Nice car,” he said. “Too bad it has such a shit engine.”</p><p>Behind him was the unmistakable, unhinged-jaw scream of a TC24 crossflow head.</p>

<p>After the latest bureaucrat looked over my proposal with scornful eyes, cast their gaze across my insurance documentation, and met me with a firm no, I was pretty much ready to pop. Getting a motorsports venue in this city was hard enough already, but negotiating with these morons was something else.</p><p>Back at home in the race cave, I looked at poster-size images of my former parking-lot glory, crude magnetic numbers slapped onto the side of what ended up being a surprisingly expensive “stock” Miata. I nursed my whisky sour, shaking the cubes in the bottom of the glass as I contemplated a way out of the current mess.</p><p>At once it occurred to me. I would stage a parade. But not just any parade. A parade for <i>children</i>. Yes indeed, I would lead those children through a maze of cones, at high speed, while strapped to the front of a car.</p><p>That Thursday, I visited the autocross clubhouse, a stolen child in hand to demonstrate the masterful simplicity of my solution. The presentation went off without a hitch, I thought, but then a hand shot up at the back. Of course, I saw, a grognard.</p><p>My blood ran cold and then turned to frothing white-hot rage as he illustrated in point form, counting each one off on his fingers, which SCCA classes a child duct-taped to the hood is illegal in. It turns out it was all of them. The crowd burst into murmurs, trying to figure out how they could properly rebuild their cars to not only run in the new venue, but cheat effectively.</p><p>I left that meeting frustrated, pinching my temples at how they could deny such a fantastic venue for the smallest rulebook quibble. It was then that an unshaven, caveman-like person approached me. The Subaru owner, mid-vape, asked me if I would consider having a children’s cancer parade on <i>dirt</i> instead.</p>

<p>We were deep in the bowels of the American Dream and the prognosis was grim. My compatriot turned to me, expressed discontent with the way tonight was turning out. I only had a mild half-shrug for him, returning my eyes to the road as the rain beat down on us.</p><p>Everything had started out alright. One of my debtors had finally decided to cough up the vig I had given him after multiple trips to the junkyard and offering to “get it all on one bill” with my falsified student discount card. To my surprise, the debt was repaid in the form of one (1) Rolls Royce Silver Shadow II, 1987 edition. Turns out that one of <i>his</i> debtors had refused to pony up the cash to put fancy new tires under his fancy old car, and left it to him in what I can only assume was a game of Russian roulette.</p><p>What do you do when someone hands you a Rolls Royce that’s effectively free because of your lax accounting standards? You sawzall out the fenders and put 33 inch Super Swampers under the car, of course. Rides like a dream. Rides like the <i>American</i> dream, which brings us back to the start of the story.</p><p>Before our trip to visit America, the glorified and vaunted land of Trump, we expected great things from the restaurant known as Hardee’s. But we were oh so wrong. Our voyage ended in tragedy before it had even begun, unless your definition of success involves doing savage neck-snapping burnouts in a stripped, caged and primed 80s Rolls Royce on off-road tires.</p>

<p>My fellow raiders and I decided to have an impromptu conference to discuss our shared aims and goals for the next quarter of business. I wore my finest bandana, emblazoned with the crudely drawn wax-dyed vacuum hose diagram of a 1976 CVCC engine. The meeting room could be nothing other than our Toyota Hilux prerunner, burping wet nitrous afterfire farts into the atmosphere whenever the throttle was released in anticipation of an impending whoop.</p><p>Boneripper brought up an excellent point. He had mentioned in confidence the previous week that our competitors were moving towards attempts to bolster their water-collector with fungus-farm synergies, and we should consider making a shot across their bow. When we brought the matter to conference, it was enthusiastically accepted.</p><p>At that time, A gang of Trumpites issued an intent to pursue a hostile takeover, forcing our staff to re-align the project objectives with our corporate value statement and open fire on the lifted-on-33s rusted-out Merkur Scorpio.</p>

<p>Sometimes I drink to forget.</p><p>But it didn’t work this time.</p><p>I found myself trapped in the foyer of my palatial New England mansion, cornered by a Volvo biodegradable wiring harness. Somehow, I knew that this was the cause of my problems. I could hear the far off cries of my loved ones, begging me to defeat the dreaded cable snakes and return to regular life with them.</p><p>In past nightmares of this sort, I always found myself able to be jolted awake, to leave the awkwardness and confusion of the dream state for the stark terror of waking life. As the Volvo’s engine harness began to rot before my eyes, introducing confusing lambda-sensor issues that would ultimately result in the failure of the LH-Jetronic ECU’s ability to keep order in the combustion chamber, I saw flashes of expensive parts visits to ipd. But then he appeared.</p><p>The angel of death stood before me and the harness now, and reached down.</p><p>“Sorry,” he said to me, “this one’s time has come.”</p><p>What Death didn’t know about my mansion was that I was never ten feet away from a breaker bar, ratcheting or otherwise. With a lightning-fast flail of the hand, I had knocked him to the ground and escaped with my prey.</p><p>The only way to keep this innocent Volvo redblock safe from wiring harness demons was to put it into something reliable. Well known. Well trod. But what?</p><p>Lightning struck in the background, illuminating the supple curves of a Fox body notchback. It had been saddled since birth with the secretary-spec twinspark 2.3, I knew, an engine meant for forklifts and light-duty pickup trucks. I lofted the block above my head, having subconsciously matched transmission bolt patterns. As if the Mustang sensed my intent, its hood flipped open.</p><p>When I woke up, my pillow was gone, and my credit card was maxed out. What does it mean?</p>

<p>Recently, certain individuals have asked me: do you realize what you are missing in modern, comfortable cars that other people own? Do you want to keep throwing your life away in obscure beaters with expensive parts? Do you ever want to connect with another normal human being again?</p><p>Yes, I plead with them, of course I want to rejoin them and regain my lost humanity. Obviously the best course is to buy a normal car like everyone else. I consult the internet to find out what the most popular cars are, and my dark work begins.</p><p>Weeks later, I am at the grocery store, purchasing groceries for my body. A woman is there in line. I think that this is a perfect opportunity; she is surely a normal person and I can practice talking to normal people about their cars, which is a thing normal people do. What else would they talk about? She notices that I am staring at her and beginning to profusely sweat.</p><p>“Hello, I notice you have a Honda,” I say, the sweat bouncing off my upper lip. “I also have Honda. It is a nice reliable, dependable car that does nothing in particular very well. I find it extremely adequate for my transportation needs and hope that you do as well.”<br/></p><p>Our conversation continues to the parking lot: she is wide-eyed and shaking, enraptured by my common-man plain speaking about cars. Finally, I think, this is my ticket to societal acceptance. At last we come across my car, an early-90s Civic hatchback with most of its body panels hacked out and replaced with carbon fiber (normal people appreciate fuel economy) and a methanol-injected twin turbocharged J-series V6 (normal people appreciate power as well).</p><p>“Goodbye, sir or madam!” I yell into a haze of dump pipe screams as I depart the parking lot, liquefying all four semi-slick racing tires under the pavement-cracking torque load. “Congratulations on your normalcy!”<br/></p>

<p>At last, I was mad as hell and could not take it anymore. I went to my mentor. He spoke of a city council that functioned just like a machine, and just like a machine, it could be modified, twisted, warped by those who are aware. I nodded and left his ramshackle temple, and his Suzuki Jimny perched atop a moss carpet, behind.<br/></p><p>Perhaps the fates intervened that night; a front-lit signboard on the town hall lawn proudly stated that the police were having an “enforcement community meeting” of some sort. I strode confidently in, and took the temperature of the room. Retirees and the under-stimulated alike filled the small auditorium, issuing absurdly specific demands for traffic enforcement, to protect the children, our nation’s future.</p><p>I tapped the shoulder of the moderator, and got my name on the short list. The goal was in sight, I thought, perched like a spider on the edge of my office-supply-store folding chair, fingers tented in anticipation. Then it happened: my name, the starting gun. There are, no joking, dozens of gold medalist sprinters who would have given their left nut to get to the podium as fast as I did.</p><p>“Now I’m just a small-town country lawyer,” I began to say, snapping my suspenders, “but it seems to me the <i>real</i> problem is left lane hogs.”</p><p>A gasp in the audience. One man at the back stood up, screaming in an inarticulate rage at the very <i>concept</i> that someone might go ten under in the left lane while he’s trying to get to the handjob palace off I-85. I addressed him now.</p><p>“Sir, you seem to have a good head about you. How about we form a citizens’ oversight committee for the traffic police? We can make the left lane <i>great</i> again.”<br/></p><p>More inarticulate rage, then noises of general agreement. Out of the two of us, I was probably a shoo-in for spokesman, but it was time to seal the deal. Pivoting on my heel, I ratcheted to the chief of police, confused at the drama that was unfolding before him in what was up to this moment a normal town hall. I pointed, and he knew then that I had him, his police cap bouncing jovially into the air as he was taken aback.</p><p>“From this moment on, our town will be a place where the common man is no longer held back by those who drive <i>luxury crossovers</i> and weave between multiple lanes at once while looking at their phones. If you do not comply with our demands, we will form a vigilante traffic enforcement group and exterminate the left lane hog menace.”<br/></p><p>With a few more minutes of grandstanding, I had the crowd on my side, their confused rambling now growing into a raging chant of DESTROY EVERY MDX, driven by my newfound partner. My mentor was right, I thought, as our angry mob ambled into the parking lot, overturning and torching a Toyota Venza. Democracy <i>was</i> the fastest way to get what I wanted.</p>

<p>“Your qualifications are impressive, your resume flawless and your references all checked out. Welcome to Tai Yong Medical Industries LLC,” chirped the HR drone as they surveyed my nonplussed countenance and outstanding credentials with a sense of barely comprehending awe.<br/></p><p>When I saw that they were looking for a new batch of engineers to work on prosthetic limbs, I jumped at the chance. As frequent readers of this column know, I like nothing more than to give back to society. For instance, I once held a door open for a grandmother after laying three inches of tire rubber across the handicapped spots with a nitromethane-injected Manic GT in the parking lot of a Kay Bee Toys. She was extremely grateful, I told my court-ordered psychologist at the time. I was a <i>good guy</i>, not like literally everyone with a Cummins.</p><p>On my first day, after the normal orientation, I was walking by the meeting rooms to refresh my coffee. That’s when I saw it, hung on the wall. An imperfect design, obvious from two hundred paces or more. They could never go into production with it. With my trusty company-supplied mechanical pencil in hand, I made alterations for reliability, power and economy. Just because a person had lost a limb, I would explain later to Congress, there was no reason they shouldn’t be able to get a little power bump when they swapped on a new part.</p><p>Months later, we were all invited to an exciting blowout party to demonstrate the latest and greatest from the firm. A lithe model stepped out wielding our new mechanical arm, swaying gently under the unfortunate excess weight added by my ministrations. As she lifted her arm, the sound of an unmuffled external wastegate screamed, overrich fuel ejecting from the dump pipe in a flaming cloud.</p><p>A cry rose up from the crowd, confused and angered. In a vain attempt to redirect the confusion, one of the heroic marketing flacks jumped into the fray, reading in a panicked voice from the teleprompter.</p><p>“It is true that with her new mechanical arm, she can&hellip; shift gears&hellip; in less than a twentieth of a second,” he screamed into the gossiping crowd.</p><p>By now, my coworkers have determined through interim office conversations, water cooler talk, and coffee runs that I am perhaps one of the eccentric-orbit kind of engineers. They turn to me now, understanding fully what the extra thirty thousand dollars per unit cost was.</p><p>At last, my line manager steps forward and confronts me.</p><p>“I just have one question,” he says, brow furrowing, “do you <i>really</i> know the part number for a ZZ4 crate engine by heart?”<br/></p>

<p>“Tax refund season, boys,” I bark over the dentist-on-hallucinogens shriek of the nitro-fired sawzall as I tear into a primo Skyline quarter panel. This baby will net a mint a week before Race Wars, I figure. I release the trigger and grip, and the sawzall slides gently and smoothly backward in its tactical webbing.</p><p>I shake my fist and Harbour Fright breaker bar menacingly in equal measure at the jackals who would deprive me of my precious junkyard wheelbarrow - I got here <i>early</i> for this, you leeches! - and head for the checkout. It’s a beautiful day today, and the uninterrupted field of glistening windshields all around me throw up images of the clear blue sky above. A lesser man would cry at the sight, I think, as I scrub up with the complimentary non-name-brand orange cleaner and embark upon the great unsung ordeal of the checkout line.</p><p>At last, I depart the long, winding road leading out of the self-pull yard, dodging fragments of shattered parts removed from half-running hoopties in the parking lot. Once, a million years ago, I tell the teenagers on Orientation Day, their new drivers’ licenses and worn out beaters glinting in the spring sunshine, I saw a man change an entire truck cab in the parking lot with only hand tools and a lot of swearing. They can scarcely believe me.</p><p>Yes indeed, I love the junkyard, even when I notice on my way out that next weekend is fifty percent off day. I mentally tally how much I would have saved, and grimace.</p>

<p>It was always hard for me to talk about my thing with Mustangs. Sometimes, I woke up in the middle of the night, the veins in my forearms jumping out of my skin, craving some of that sweet, sweet Fox body action. In a strange inversion of the social compact it was the peer pressure that kept me from giving in to my mental flaws.</p><p>Believe me, I wanted nothing more than to shut the windows, shut the doors and begin a journey down the endless spiral of baby-moons-on-steelies police-package notchback culture. It was my friends who stopped me from doing it, making note when they saw me ratchet my head to check out an oh-so-cheap V6 SN95 that only needed a little bit of work. Hairdresser cars, they said with more than a note of scandal-about-town, have you seen how low their <i>redlines</i> are?</p><p>In a way, I guess the Mustang has always had an unearthly hold over me. As far back as I can remember, my fixation with Iacocca’s Paradox gripped my heart and mind. Schoolteachers would call on guidance counsellors would call on resource officers would call on social workers would call on adoptive parents to check out why it was that I had such an urge to purchase, drive, and abuse Mustangs.</p><p>There was nothing to do but escape the haters, who, as the aphorism states, are gonna hate. Beneath the pale red light of an ominous morning, I drove to the boonies, to escape the criticisms and structures of ordered society. It was only there that I could confront my addiction, or be destroyed by it.</p><p>I awoke, weeks later, before a pair of Capris crudely welded together on a single frame. Had I failed myself? I flipped through notebook after notebook, but only found the crudely scrawled writing of an increasingly unhinged man: “TWO PONIES ENTER ONE BURNOUT LEAVES.”</p>

<p>The sweat was pooling around my chin in the 3M 6800 rebreathing mask.  It was difficult work, sucking in oxygen through the S-20006 filters meant to keep out everything down to mercury vapour.  &quot;It&rsquo;s for your own safety, and that of your family,&ldquo; the government-stooge-slash translator told me, fresh from his last job at TEPCO.  Ever since the Fukushima disaster brought the world&rsquo;s attention to Japan&rsquo;s aging infrastructure, their collective sense of shame had finally spurred them to action despite their shrinking economy and useless anime infatuated youth.  That&rsquo;s where I came in, an outsider, specialized foreign labour with actual muscles able to work the tools these tiny fascinating people could only gawk at. I felt like a 17 year old ringer with a mustache in little league.<br/><br/>The industrial disaster zone that I was assigned to once belonged to some car company.  I hadn&rsquo;t really heard of them, but they assured me they were pretty big in the west.  Honda?  What the fuck is a Honda? like a little stripey cat or something?  Give me a Cougar or a Thunderbird any day.   I tried to get an explanation of what we were cleaning up here from the stooge, he wasn&rsquo;t very forthcoming, mumbling something about &lsquo;electron friction surface tension&rsquo;, and walking away quickly.   Resigned to my ignorance, I spent most of my days working an enormous breaker bar, unthreading one of the many gigantic hex nuts holding down a huge flange with four hundred bolts through it.  My diminutive coworkers, probably press-ganged from the local pachinko parlour, toiled in gangs of four, heaving on a five meter cheater bar.  Whatever was in this gigantic half buried cylinder must be pretty awful stuff.<br/><br/>Finally, the last nut yielded to the force I was exerting on it.  The 20cm thick flange quickly twisted like a beer can and squealed like only heavy metal plate is capable of.  My pulse raced and my eyes darted back and forth in a lizard brain fight-or-flight response as I tried to figure out what was in there.  We felt the earth shake.  Earthquake? No, it felt different from the other tremors I had experienced in my time on the 'Rim.  It felt like&hellip; speed.  Yes, that was it, the sun was moving across the sky a little faster.  This was the place where Honda had dumped all the excess torque from their engines during the tuning process, that explains why all my coworkers were running away like something out of a Looney Tunes short, they thought it was dangerous poison.<br/><br/>I knew better, but I still didn&rsquo;t really want to think about how well my mask&rsquo;s filters worked on an ethereal unit of measure.<br/></p>

<p>Years ago, he said, a Dodge engineer was out here. They were testing a Dart prototype on gravel roads, went down the wrong turn, and was consumed. Consumed, I asked, but the old man was already onto a new topic. He had more grim portents and dire warnings for me, I was certain, but my schedule was tight enough as it was and so I bid him farewell. As I receded I could hear the words of his incomprehensible ramble bouncing off the tin walls of the junkyard’s sales trailer.</p><p>Driving for hours out here changed a man. Distances became harder to read, you can no longer trust your own sense of sleep deprivation. I had been driving for hours to get out to this little junkyard; perhaps it was time for rest and relaxation. A small town’s sign flickered past on the highway, advertising no actual services except for a part-time gas station. It would do better than hitting a highway embankment, I figured.</p><p>I pulled into the diner, ordered a Monte Cristo. It was succulent yet crisp, emblematic of the inherent discord at the heart of quality cuisine. Partway through my first half of the sandwich, I saw a bricknose Ford start up on the edge of the parking lot, its motor mounts sagging as the starter chucked its 351 into life. It’s strange how memory plays tricks on you. I felt a strange pull towards the light-duty pickup and could not stop looking at it, sensing something was different.<br/></p><p>And different it was.</p><p>The Ford turned sharply and exited the lot, without the smallest perceptible bit of power steering whine. I immediately arose from my seat, placing my hands on the window and staring at the truck as it departed on the main drag.</p><p>That’s when the other occupants of the diner realized I was not one of them. I was of a strange rotation to their natural vibration, not of the correct breeding to be privy to their secrets. They turned on me then, as if guided by a single mind.</p><p>I barely escaped the diner with the use of my wits, a butter knife, and an ABC fire extinguisher purloined in haste from the kitchen. With the adrenaline pumping through my veins, I knew it was no longer necessary to stay here for the night, and as such placed an ever-increasing amount of distance between my rear bumper and the site of that fateful strangeness.</p><p>Once I had escaped, I thought long and hard about what it was exactly that I had witnessed. I knew that it was an unnatural thing for a Ford to have a silent power steering pump, but I also sensed in my bones that in this part of the world, perhaps the ley lines of purestrain weirdness had converged beneath that small town.</p><p>I miss that Monte Cristo sandwich sometimes, even when I think back upon it and realize it tasted a lot like a Dodge engineer.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, turkeys are the most devious beasts the human race has ever seen. Why, I once saw a wild turkey rip a man’s face <i>clean off</i>. Yeah. Now I see the fear in your eyes. Pull up a chair, and let me tell you the story of how I got revenge.</p><p>The year was ‘72, or ‘73. It was a dry summer, either way. Out on the farm, things were getting bad - the water for the cows was evaporating right out of the tubs, the lawn was burnt - the usual sort of thing. My father came to me and told me to head to the market and pick up a few animals from his business partner, who was selling a kind of livestock that used less water. At the time, I figured he was an early innovator as far as being a “water wise” farmer went, but in retrospect I realize he was just cheap.</p><p>I borrowed the family farm truck. Back then, you see, we didn’t have such luxuries as leather or dampers in our trucks: they were for work and impromptu spinal alignments only. Its rattletrap engine was always one foot in the grave, and trying to shift the three-on-the-tree reminded me of swimming in pudding laced with glass shards. That said, that old truck got us to and from market, where hopefully I would find the farm’s salvation.</p><p>As these things go, I pressed the flesh and made amends at the market, and I was in due course told to seek out old Tom, who also just happened to be the half-unhinged former business partner of my father. We never figured out what made him that way, but on that day I would see a new side of him, a different way of being.</p><p>Tom was an immense man, the sort of man that in different times would have been considered a leader just because of his physiology. But our world was changing, and he wasn’t. I asked him what was up with his turkeys, and to pick out two for our family farm. Obediently, he leaned over the fence to the pen, his meaty paws reaching for the gangliest-looking turkeys to scam my dad with. With a prompt boot to the ass, I sent him sailing.</p><p>As his body descended into the turkey pen, the flesh stripping like wrapping paper from the bone, I looked down at him. His screams were inaudible over the furious gobbling, deafening even the snoopiest onlooker. I could barely comprehend the series of actions that had led up to this point. Sweeping my arm across his desk, I loaded my rucksack with the blood-soaked detritus of his business administration, just as I had been told.</p><p>Returning to my father, he said nothing but put a hand on my shoulder, and looked proud. For the first time, I had done the right thing, and forever from then on, I would get a little weepy at Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>I had a problem, and it wasn’t easy to solve it. If you asked anyone, they would tell you that I was always interested in learning new things. But on this project, there was <i>so much</i> to learn. But after several months of late nights and weekends spent at the local public library, I knew enough to be dangerous.</p><p>An uncaring sky loomed overhead as the neon rain fell onto my canary-yellow Lotus Elite, its spackled fibreglass body cutting an inspiring shape in the night. At last, I returned home and, stretching my hands, I slipped on leather fingerless gloves and began my dark work.</p><p>Breaking into the mainframe was easy enough; my adherence to the public library had taught me all the fundamentals of computer security. But to get further, I had to understand just how my quarry thought, worked, lived. I realized with a start that it was surprisingly easy - perhaps once they were like me, so many years ago. At last, I had delivered the payload. I worked quickly to cover my tracks.</p><p>Perhaps I had been too dramatic in my changes. The next morning, the entire internet was abuzz with news of my great hack. In the office, I passed by a plasma TV from a prior decade, excitedly relaying CNN.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen, implacable: “BMW RECALLS CARS FOR FUNCTIONAL TURN SIGNALS.”</p><p>An executive of the automaker was on now, apologizing for the fact that their cars’ turn signals had not only become functional, but <i>automatic</i> - making the operators of the cars reliable and safe members of society. Naturally, the phone calls to BMW headquarters by said operators started immediately, at first querying as to what the strange clicking noise and flashing arrows on the dashboard were for, and then, when told, exploding in white-hot rage. He blamed some strange virus that had been installed in their mainframe by an unknown saboteur, possibly an orphaned fringe element loyal to the discredited Saab brand.</p><p>Saab? I wrinkled my nose in disgust, offended that anyone would compare me to those parked-in-reverse, middle-keying, magnesium-axle maniacs. As I looked away from the screen for the first time, I realized that one of my coworkers had been watching me the entire time. He <i>knew</i>, and I could see him raise his keyless-entry fob to his mouth and speak softly into it.</p><p>The Elite rippled under hard acceleration as I left the office and my former life behind. In a few miles, I would switch the Lotus for one of the beater cars I had hidden around the periphery of the city and start anew in a town more amenable to front-wheel drive. Ahead of me, a 740i signalled correctly and returned to the right lane politely, leaving adequate following distance for the Protege it had passed. I smiled.</p>

<p>They told me there was a $600 Citroen ID19. That’s not funny, I told them. It was like telling a meth addict you had a big hearty dose of chocolate-covered Sudafeds in your closet. Of course, they thought it was hilarious. Flipped the switch, pushed a print-out of the ad across the table and my mind exploded.</p><p>So much possibility. So much junk. No picture. Bad seller? Yeah, bad seller. Maybe abandoned project? Had to be. So many unique parts. Hydraulic spheres, broken valve tappets, soft valve seats that couldn’t deal with the brutal strain of unleaded. That’s when they tightened the noose on me. My captor slid six hundred dollars in crisp plastic twenties across the table, tapped on it, told me it was “a bonus.” The monster.</p><p>He got what he wanted. The Citroen was mine. They receded behind the one-way glass at the side of the garage, watched me to go to work. For a year of my life I dedicated myself to constructing this awful beast before them, collapsing on the oil-stained creeper for a quick nap in between bouts of productivity and pointless web surfing. At last it was complete. I could scarcely look myself in the face anymore, my own reflection twisted with untamed hair growth and the feral eyes of a trapped mountain lion.</p><p>Before me was my shackle, but in a way it was my freedom, as well. The hydraulic system of the ID19 was just what I needed; a few web orders to Princess Auto to liberate their hydraulics department of foot-thick stainless steel pressurization rams was a worthy upgrade. When my captor returned, wanting me to explain the Citroen’s strange transformation to him, he attempted to make me comply with use of the shock collar. I fixated on the twin-supercharged LM7 bursting forth from the Citroen’s once-domed hood to make it through my ordeal.</p><p>As my captor retreated from the room, always facing his back to the wall and never losing sight of my hands, another man entered. It seemed the Project was over. Through careful observation of me, they had discovered what was <i>wrong</i> with me. They had a cure, he said, wielding a syringe. I could be normal again, and all the others like me could be productive members of society and with our energies and knowledge propel humanity into a new golden age of unlimited potential if only we would let go of our hydrocarbon-induced brain damage.</p><p>The Citroen slammed through the back of the garage, scattering equipment and personnel across the underground tunnels of the surrounding facility. They had tried to install a kill switch in the Gallic murder machine, I noted, during one of the fitful rests I had taken during the construction. It didn’t quite take, except for breaking the stereo. Just as well: it’s not like it would have been audible over the cackling resonators at the end of the car’s side-exit exhaust.</p><p>As I re-entered the light of day, I reflected on what had transpired as the long-throw hydraulic suspension ran gently over the bodies of the base’s so-called guards. There was nothing wrong with what I was doing: the ID19 was the logical choice, elegance and poise mixed in the ultimate package of 50s futurism. What did they want me to do, <i>rebuild an automatic</i>?</p>

<p>I hit the nitrous oxide like Frank Booth, and for a moment I’m not sure if the furious clattering aft of my four inch dump pipe is the sound of envy or rods hitting the tarmac. It doesn’t really matter, I think now, slithering the eight-ball shifter into the next gear and finishing off the throw with a deft sideways flick of the wrist as I step to the next lane.</p><p>The cluster of gold rings on my left hand shimmers in the wan beams of the dying fluorescents backlighting the hellish nightscape that lies ahead. I work the wheel like a million launches before, teaching the oversprung rear end that weight transfer happens according to my will and not those of a commoner’s dusted-over physics textbook.</p><p>I swing the car across two lanes of parking spots, sliding to a perfect stop next to the cart corral. Flawless, I think, walking backwards so I can admire the sublime lines of the 2002 Chevy Metro hatchback for just a few seconds more before entering the Home Depot.</p>

<p>You look like the kind of guy who has discerning taste. Let me tell you the story of how I killed Joe Isuzu, the beloved character who promoted such standout warm rods as the Impulse, the Rodeo and even the feared <i>Hombre</i>.</p><p>The year was next year. It’s going to get a little weirder from here on out, but the important thing is that as I explain it you focus on my words and not the secondary or tertiary implications of my words. Do <i>not</i> attempt to adjust your set; there is no set, and if there somehow is, you don’t want to touch it.</p><p>I was cruising down near Guadalupe, having headed down there to pick up one of the last of the B13 Nissan Tsurus in an attempt to create a clean-sheet SE-R in accordance with the waking peyote dreams that dogged me through the preceding months. It wasn’t an inspirational car as delivered: the broad-chested highport SR20DE screamer had been replaced with an efficient one-point-something that probably promoted the existence of fiscal restraint. Luckily, the product planners had cheaped out in the right ways otherwise, and left me with a pleasant medium-ratio manual steering rack that filled my hands with feedback.</p><p>As I came upon a clearing, I noticed a solitary man standing on the shoulder. I don’t know why I stopped; perhaps I did it for the story. Upon further analysis, the man was determined to be a dissheveled Joe Isuzu, left to die in Mexico after his parent company’s hasty retreat from North America. He looked at me and clumsily attempted to regain the ability to speak English.</p><p>“You know,” he said, his jaw swimming horizontally in a sinusoidal pattern, “the Isuzu Impulse Turbo is much faster than this, and over six thousand dollars cheaper.”<br/></p><p>“Joe,” I said, “It’s 2017. Isuzu has been gone for eight years.”<br/></p><p>He outreached his hand, and I could see the bloodshot sclera of his eyes as he reached for me through the passenger side window, a shaking cipher from a forgotten era. Then he turned to dust, enormous flakes of ash blowing away alongside the tumbleweeds, loft gently in the desert wind.</p><p>On the talk show circuit, they all asked me if I regretted what I had done. They asked me if it was a horrible weight on my back to have broken the dream of a better America, a number-five Japanese automaker that could have been a contender. I tell them the same thing every time.</p><p>Would <i>I</i> lie to you?</p>

<p>There was nothing like a Firebird for the open road. Sure, the Camaro adherents would wail and claw at their faces until they drew blood, begging to tell you about the model-specific details that somehow made their poodle-shit-brown Z/28s the superior road racing and street driving machine. But the Firebird had an understated elegance about it, at least until I came into the picture.</p><p>My ‘74 was something a little different. I had come across it in a rural yard years prior, the plastic bumpers stripped beyond their primer, the rest of the body in a calico mixture of whatever the Canadian Tire spray paint aisle had on sale after the most recent impact. The carpet was long gone, and I did my duty, replacing it with a thick film of textured bedliner (for grip) and installing atop it six-point Recaros latched onto a harness bar the thickness of a dog’s skull.</p><p>On the highway, it was loud, to be certain. The sound deadening of the bedliner wasn’t enough to cover up the massive gashes I had driven into the wheelwells to allow for the obscene prolapse of its knobby kevlar Wranglers on GMC truck rally wheels. The huge offroad tires’ carcasses squealed and chewed as they distorted under the cruel yoke of the Prozac-beating hum of the well-balanced 327.</p><p>We were in Langdon, on a special assignment from the Organization. Had things not worked out the way our ideals promoted in those early heady days? It was hard to tell, now, in the 37th consecutive month of the Project. I pulled the Firebird into a service station, its fuel gauge and our nerves both on their last pip.</p><p>My travelling companion and enforcer stepped out of the car as I released the remote fuel door, striding confidently towards the attached convenience store. In the daylight-beating fluorescent glow, I squeezed the filler trigger a little harder than normal, keeping my head on a swivel for anything that even moderately resembled threat.</p><p>At last my vigilance was rewarded - if that’s the right word for it. Across the lot, I could see a 1980s Range Rover Classic wake up, stirring gently on its seeping air shocks. I set the trigger lock on the filler and kneeled as if to tie my shoe. What the Range Rover didn’t see was my special utility box cut into the rockers of the Firebird. I got the idea from a truck ad, and always figured this day would come.</p><p>The biometric authenticator beeped happily. It flipped the mag-latch open, and my prize dropped into my hand, like an overdetailed resin model of a pregnant witch librarian in Osaka’s seediest Taito Arcade. I barely got a chance to pull the trigger before the Range Rover broadsided the Firebird, the impact catapulting me backward across the grass median and off a light standard. I could feel the acrid tang of copper in my mouth as I smiled, knowing the Range Rover driver had gotten it so much worse than me.</p><p>One happy morning in the distant past, a proud mother in New England held her newborn child in her arms, and imagined great things for him. What I’m almost certain she didn’t count on was that he would be murdered by two thousand three hundred and thirty five pounds per square inch of concussive force across his body from a distance of seventeen feet.</p><p>I ratcheted the freewheeling head on the force driver to charge it, spinning it like a trainee cheerleader’s overeager baton routine. Slowly returning to my feet, I didn’t break line of sight with the driver or what was left of the cockpit around him.</p><p>My partner, the enforcer, the one who was supposed to deal with this kind of thing, returned from his piss break to find a crushed quarter panel on the Firebird and enough small pieces of a Range Rover thrown across the lot to choke an entire daycare.</p><p>“This station didn’t have turn signal bulbs either,” is all he can say to me.<br/></p>

<p>My mentor always spoke about how an eye for an eye would make the whole world blind. He was no fan of revenge, that was for sure. Under his tutelage I had learned so much about forgiving my enemies, loving them and dismissing their sins as the effects of an imperfect world upon imperfect people. When I left his protection, however, I discovered tailgaters.</p><p>It was an ordinary commute, normal as could be, except for the set of X5 twinkly-eyelash headlights and chrome-package grille filling my rear view mirror. The usual passive-aggressive engine braking and gentle loss of speed to below the road limit wasn’t working. Nope, this one was persistent, like a barnacle on an asshole. Something like that, at least.</p><p>Changing lanes, I allowed the behemoth safe passage. It filled the generous gap I had left between me and the car formerly in front, and immediately proceeded to tailgate the other car, a Corolla plastered with a homemade “New Driver” placard. I frowned. Tailgating a monster like me was one thing, but the injustice of making one’s formative years of newly discovered mobile freedom a living hell was something I could not abide.</p><p>I continued to follow the X5, well past my proper turn-off. The operator was oblivious, and I kept my distance, separated by a sea of econoboxes and shipping-container-sized urban CUVs. At last, they turned down a winding residential street, leading me to their home. I thought long and hard about what my mentor had said, considered turning the other cheek. In fact, I had contemplated this for so long that the sun set. It seemed my choice was made for me. If not providence, then convenience.</p><p>With a practiced, quick hand, I opened my glovebox and removed my gift for the tailgater. No, I would never damage another person’s car; that was for total douchebags, and I was only a court jester, living for the moment of satirical ribaldry that was the velvet glove slipped around total emotional destruction.</p><p>I do so enjoy going to Staples. I particularly like the pre-made magnet sheets. You could cut them to the perfect bumper-sticker size, and make up bumper stickers to put on them. Those bumper stickers could say <i>anything</i> - for instance, things like “THE HOLOCAUST NEVER HAPPENED” and “MY SON IS A GRAND DRAGON” in enormous red text.</p><p>In retrospect, if I had followed that X5 during the morning commute, I would have perhaps figured out where it parked during the day. My boss at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre had an extremely awkward morning when the regional supervisor happened to follow him into the parking lot.</p><p>After the fires had died down, I asked the regional supervisor if he followed my boss at a respectable distance. After all, it was pretty hard to cram all those words onto the sticker without shrinking the font size.</p>

<p>Like ancient times, the smoke signal beckoned me closer. I let the Bronco’s overstressed 460 lull itself into a deep torpor, dieseling gently as I pulled the key out of the ignition and stepped out on the running board. My sparkling bounty laid ahead, and like they said in Japan during my internship: whales taste really good.</p><p>On the side of the expressway, an RX-8 sat gently smouldering. I figured it for an R3, and asked the owner as such.</p><p>“What?” he screamed at me. “I don’t know what it is, it just set on fire while I was driving it. Can’t you put it out?”<br/></p><p>I scratched my chin, looked at the copious fire-protection gear strapped to the internal rollcage of the Bronco, and back at the roaring Mazda fire.</p><p>“I’ll put it out if you let me buy it. Opening bid is a hundred dollars, and I suggest you decide quickly.”</p><p>Once again, I was struck down by own hubris. Squinting my eyes to see through the acrid smoke of the rapidly combusting interior, I saw an automatic gear selector perched atop the blistered centre console.</p><p>“On second thought, fire’s too good for it. Have yourself a nice day, friend.”<br/></p>

<p>The Rambler thumps out two more licks of fire, and then is deathly still. I was alone in the forest, the pin-drop quiet seeming to settle into my bones alongside the growing cold.</p><p>All of the Federales I had dodged on my way here were probably aware that I had slipped their line by now, would be doubling back to come and look for me. There was no time to delay. I leapt from the plush imitation-zebra Recaros and strode confidently to the back of the car, the electric door poppers already launching the trunk lid into the air.</p><p>Within the cavernous yet tinny trunk, I knew, I would find my salvation. I would find the end to all this madness.</p><p>Squinting through the glare of the trunk’s annoyingly-named courtesy lights, I reached for my contraband, my fingers finding purchase on its tight paper wrap. Quick hands made quick work, and I stuffed it into the pre-arranged tree trunk.</p><p>The kevlar Wranglers spun up, kicking me backwards as the wail of the Rambler’s straight-cut reverse gear filled the cabin. I popped a J-turn and laid a tactical burnout to cover my tracks, then departed into the night.</p><p>With any luck, my contact would retrieve the loot and I would be allowed back into our secret club. Preserving my torrent ratio was essential, you see, and my home connection totally sucked for upload in the evenings.</p>

<p>They told me my money would be safe in blue chip funds, mutual funds, foreign currency funds, index funds. They were wrong. One after the other, as the economy burned out, I took a hit. How could I safely plan my retirement in a time of such utter financial chaos?</p><p>Before long, it occurred to me what the true answer was. I had to beat inflation. Inflation was the enemy, sapping my savings ever so slightly. But what commodity’s price growth constantly outstripped inflation? The thought was still at the forefront of my mind as I stepped into the Canadian Tire, and then I saw it.</p><p>I would create a hedge fund consisting entirely of investments in Sylvania Silverstar Ultras, the bespoke high-dollar headlight bulb that cost thirty bucks a bulb. Yes. It all made sense now: the people would always demand headlights, the market would always be there. But the <i>margin</i> - oh my yes, the margin - must ever grow. I could corner the market, buying hoards of Silverstars, sitting on them for a few months and then selling them for just under the new retail price.</p><p>Helicopters, supermodels, the finest parties and the most exotic beluga caviar followed. I didn’t really care for them - truth be told, my heart was back with 80s Tercels and discussions about carburetors instead of exotic derivatives - but it was a pretty nice way to spend a few weeks, all told. At one blowout soireé in Shibuya, though, everything changed.</p><p>Tim Sylvania, the heir to the Sylvania headlights fortune, was there. He knew who I was, of course, and he knew what my game was. I saw his hand flicker to his waist, returning with a switchblade. A good old fashioned Wall Street knife fight, just like I had seen in the sepia-tinged photos of the twenties. Fine by me, I thought, pulling my Ka-Bar from its concealed wrist sheath.</p><p>The lawyers are still hashing out the exact details of who won, but just between you and me - only one of us survived, and it’s the one writing this blog entry. Ironically, it turned out that Tim Sylvania just didn’t have the vision required to fight me after I threw my jacket on his face and stabbed him in the chest.</p><p>I’ll never forget his dying words: “You should have bought Osrams instead, dude.”</p>

<p>The lawyer flexed his spindly fingers, his knuckles cracking. Then he told me I was no longer allowed to use the copyrighted Gulf livery on my fleet of rotary-powered Toyota Starlet silhouette racers. I offered to negotiate.</p><p>After I had finished working him over with a TI-83 Plus wrapped in a tube sock, I took his law-talkin’ badge and used it to retroactively make my copyright infringement not only legal but highly necessary. The judge at the trial agreed with my interpretation of the Gulf livery, and we were off to the races. Literally - again, they were race cars, not sure what part of this you’re not getting.</p><p>It’s easy to tell who has been to the track and who hasn’t. My arch-rival, Steve “Nipples” Hemingway, was definitely one of the former group, as was I. He took one look at my buzzing swarm of eleven-thousand-rpm Starlets and turned his upper lip up, like a cat contemplating a lime.</p><p>“So what did <i>you</i> bring?” I asked, knowing full well it would suck.<br/></p><p>Steve looked at me, that devilish glint in his eye that drove the women mad, and pointed to the paddock. There, I would receive my comeuppance.</p><p>My God. It was beautiful. Hemingway had swapped a turbodiesel engine into a slammed Lada Niva. But he hadn’t stopped there. The monster had gone so far as to build a digital boost gauge out of nixie tubes.</p><p>He noticed my frantic gasping for air and smiled, pointing wordlessly with a smug expression to the Dekatron air-fuel ratio gauge on the A-pillar. It was <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>What he didn’t notice was that I still had my blood-soaked state-mandated graphing calculator assault weapon in my back pocket. <i>Dasvidaniya</i>, comrade.</p>

<p>Central Dispatch had told me to be on time, get on the plane, show up. There was a sensitive situation they needed actionable intel on, and nobody could be counted on except for me. I was assured that all the preparations had been taken, and my usual car would be available at the rental desk.</p><p>I notice a lot of things; it’s sort of my job. When I was a kid, I was always good at noticing the details that other people wished I had never earned. It wasn’t the best way to survive, but it got me where I am today. That said, I can’t remember much about the flight in. It’s probably for the best.</p><p>The airport’s grimy tile makes my penny loafers squeak as I glide across the concourse to the used car desk. I saunter up to the attendant, turn on the full spectrum of charm, show her my identification, get her to bring my car around.</p><p>A Chevrolet Sonic pulls into the forecourt and honks insistently at me.</p><p>Surely there’s been some mistake, I say to the attendant. I have a very specific car intended for me. She frowns, looks at my reservation, then at the computer. No, she says, you’re not a Platinum Reserve member, and so your reservation clearly says “Aston Martin Vanquish <i>or similar</i>.” This is the similar, she states flatly, and underscores it by rapping the Sonic’s keys gently on the marble desk.</p><p>On my way out of the rental lot, the Sonic’s wheezy Korean mill tries its hardest to generate motive force over the protestations of its crude slushbox. I am just about ready to get out of the car and walk when I see a pair of vacationers in Hawaiian shirts repeatedly stalling an Aston Martin in the parking garage outside.</p>

<p>A lot of people would call me very polite. I don’t raise my voice to strangers or throw obscene gestures to them out of the window of my car while doing a burnout on their child’s face. Recently, I had cause to reconsider my stance on politeness thanks to a very friendly group of television workers.</p><p>It was a cold March morning like any other. I was studying the bottom of my cup of coffee while combing through the morning news. Throughout my regimen, my highly-advanced metatextual search agents would ping my tablet with notifications of exotic parts that are priced well below market, victims of the recession and the limited free time and unlimited ambition of the car-guy lifestyle. I set up a series of appointments to pick up those parts, checked my cash-in-hand stash, and checked my street-parking-rotation schedule to figure out what car I would be moving today to dodge the roving eye of bylaw enforcement.</p><p>Opening the door, I strode confidently down the sidewalk of my house. But there was a snag. Where ordinarily I would see my lawn, instead I saw a TLC camera crew and one excessively perky host.</p><p>“Hello!” she screamed at me, making sure to stand awkwardly to one side to make sure my unshaven face was framed properly for national television. “You’re on Hoarders!”</p><p>I could scarcely believe my ears. Which of my confidantes had betrayed me? They were trying to get their hands on my collection of Megasquirts. With great effort I quelled the panic rising in my throat and went full diplomacy on their asses.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem,” I began, “I can stop any time I want.”<br/></p><p>Everything went dark. It was only in retrospect, after seeing the dailies, that I realized the host had shot me with a high-intensity non-lethal compliance weapon. Twenty-four thousand volts of nervous system-disrupting power knocked me on my ass and then out cold, in front of the American people, chanting for blood and redemption in equal measure.</p><p>Over the next few weeks of filming, the Hoarders crew subjected me to electroshock therapy in full camera, while weeping over the collections of unused Britcar wiring harnesses and rare Alfa parts they found abandoned in my backyard shed of nightmares. Well-meaning psychiatrists yearned to understand why I would have forty sets of tires and wheels in bolt patterns for cars I no longer owned. Actors playing my parents would call me on speakerphone, begging me to abandon my sick quest to own enough Hayashi Streets to build another house out of them. It was all too much, and then, before I knew it, it was over.</p><p>Re-entering my house, I checked my primary, secondary and tertiary parts rooms. They were barren. The only parts that still remained were a small box of RockAuto goodies I was putting off installing in my daily driver. Those bastards had even taken the <i>magnets</i>!</p><p>My phone bleeped. It seemed the search agents had located the Kijiji ad for selling off the seized parts “to a good home.” I was hesitant. Dare I start this shame spiral again, pushing those around me away in the pursuit of hollow materialism, of being “that guy with all the parts?” This was a new chance, to start over. Yes, I became convinced. That was it. <i>Start over</i>.</p><p>Heart beating, I looked down at the phone, convinced of my resolve. In my horror, I realized I had replied to the ad and set up an appointment entirely based on muscle memory. They were mine again. And more importantly, the TLC big wigs would be there, gloating at how much money they made off of my used-parts lucre. I began to feel a cold rage prickling the back of my neck, and it was then that I realized fighting my true nature was folly.</p><p>In the garage, a Maserati Biturbo, held aloft on trophy truck suspension, was to be my willing companion on this quest of revenge. I rested into its lush leather racing-emulation seat as the LS6 under its hood leapt to life.</p><p>Very well. If it was redemption the television people wanted, it was what they were going to get.</p>

<p>I like my cars like I like my music: Japanese and slow. Real slow. A hundred horsepower? What’s your hurry, Jack? Take some time and relish the acceleration.</p><p>In my low-horsepower warm rods, preserving momentum is essential. I once apexed a corner so well I not only maintained my ground speed but momentarily created a gravity well that drained the Prius in front of me of fuel and horsepower as the aerodynamic buffeting slingshot me smoothly into traffic.</p><p>Once, I rear ended a guy in stop and go traffic, but the cop looked at my car and told the guy I rear ended that he was asking for it. Wrote him a ticket for travelling too slowly, right on the spot. The weird thing is, the guy didn’t even protest.</p><p>Yep, I guess you could say slow is the way to live your life.</p><p>Wait, eBay turbo kits are $360 for a wastegate, turbo <i>and manifold</i>? How much is next day shipping?</p>

<p>Elon Musk was beyond incensed at the way I had barged into his party with my crudely-hacked electric car. The truth of the matter was, I didn’t have much of a choice. It turns out that brakes are really hard to get right.</p><p>He screamed at me and pointed at a confused gaggle of valets, now tentatively swarming my automobile in hopes of safely parking it and rescuing the night. I simply shrugged, and set my creation into another flat spin, all four 165-width low rolling resistance tires turning into acrid smoke on his polished marble foyer.</p><p>As I let the wheel go and erupted down his entrance stairway, the rear-steer tucked in to give me a tight enough cornering radius to overcome the inertia lent the chassis by my hubris. Before long, I was gone into the night, and only the sound of squealing economy tires and the ethereal whine of brushless DC motors could pinpoint my location.</p><p>I briefly considered menacing some gasoline vehicles on the highway, to show them the fury of instant nut-busting torque and the ludicrous feats of mechanical grip I was capable of. Despite what you’ve heard from my affiliates, I do feature a level of self-control. Okay, I got distracted.</p><p>My smartphone bleeped, and I reached through the drivers’ window net to strike the call-answer button crudely ziptied to the demon car’s exocage. It was Elon, of course.</p><p>“Turns out all you need to do to put AWD into an electric car is just to cut two Priuses in half and weld their fronts together!” I joyfully chirped, as I imagined the steam wafting from his collar.</p><p>Elon hung up. I continued my voyage towards home, chuckling. The streetlights around me flickered and died. No. Something was flying in front of them.</p><p>As the first of the interceptor drones flapped their carbon fiber wings against my windshield glass, I punched the hybrid system out of EV mode. There was always a time to go <i>old</i>-school, I muttered to myself as the twin LS4s beneath the hoods spooled their immense Holset turbochargers, the whistling clarion call from their finely-blued screamer pipes a herald of glorious battle.</p>

<p>I key up the PA system. The smooth shopping-mall notes of the vaporwave backing track dip perceptibly as I try my finest Barry White voice. It all comes out sounding like a tequila-soaked cockfight in a McDonalds drive through, and all nearby pedestrians stop and screw their faces up in confusion, yearning in their bones for a translator that will never come.</p><p>Given the circumstances, you’d think they could infer from context that my overburdened Protege is about to rampage up the sidewalk and through a fruit cart, but perhaps the Bubble Era soundtrack has lulled them into a false bubble of contentment that the buzzy PA warnings cannot pierce. After the first set of grapefruit bounces off the comically-flared box fenders of the Protege, I figure they grasp the nuances of the concept.</p><p>Leaping back into traffic, I snap the PA handset back to its original position as both hands are needed to right the tiller and gain a mechanical advantage over the massive unsprung weight of the roaring Super Swampers. At last I can pin the throttle, and the dense column of torque steer pushed by the shrieking LS4 beneath the hood is adequately damped with a deft but firm hand. The chassis flex becomes more apparent the harder I hit the throttle.</p><p>This is still a lot better than that day I accidentally put on ice cream music, I tell myself as the relaxing strains of a shampoo commercial played at half speed fill the subway entrance I am barrelling through. Subway denizens scatter, and I grimace at the memory of that fateful day. </p>

<p>Maybe it was a little bit too far, I realized now. I should have done things the proper ways, through the proper channels. But at the moment, I wanted that contraband so very dearly that I would have done nearly anything. Big Government slipped the cuffs over my driving gloves and I was done for the day.</p><p>It had started innocently enough. An order to McMaster-Carr, to get some heim joints and build my own adjustable budget sway bar endlinks. Who could possibly take offense at that? It had worked out for so many others.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when I received a letter declaring in stern words that for national security reasons I was not to be allowed to order the critical defense technology that is the heim joint and M6 bolt. National security reasons? My ex-wives had called me a lot of horrible things, but terrorist was surely not one of them.</p><p>I knew what was to be done. I pointed my turbo Caravan south and dumped the gas, the boost-infused torque steer offering me just a whiff of my ancestors’ antics aboard their Conestoga wagons so very long ago.</p><p>Before long, I had turned my illicit trips across the border into a bustling source of income. Metric bolts, clip fasteners, all the bounty of America, was being shared with my fellow cold-footed garage fabricators. It brought a tear to my eye.</p><p>One morning, it had all gone so wrong. My turbo Caravan was pulled over, searched. The border control agent pointed his xenon tactical-grade flashlight at me, then at the heim joints, then back at me.<br/></p><p>“Was the purpose of this visit business or,” he began to ask.</p><p>“I fuck those heim joints,” I blurted out.</p><p>Later, my high-caliber defense attorney (Steve “The Hammer” Hammer, not his real name) would tell me that Fastenal had a branch only a few blocks from my apartment. That would have been handy to know <i>before</i> I was put on the metric-bolt sex offender registry, Steve.</p>

<p>It was nearly 7 AM by the time we completed the job. I had blown the sewing machine beneath the hood of my trusty but rusty 1.5L Civic and drifted to a stop outside a Honda dealership. The wrong kind of Honda dealership.</p><p>Before long, I had lashed ten 150cc GY6s together into a crude amalgam of the original displacement, and topped it off with a lawnmower engine for the starter. If my mentors could see me now, they would probably be sadly shaking their heads and wondering where they went wrong.</p><p>As the Civic axle-tramped into the next lane over, its swaying mass of stacked small-displacement thumpers sticking out of the crudely hacked front fender, I became dimly aware of the other occupants of the road. They were filtering crudely into traffic in order to begin their journey to their day jobs, bleary-eyed behind the wheel of their short-wheelbase-schoolbus of a seven-seater unibody crossover.</p><p>At last I pulled alongside another human being, ensconced in their Acura MDX. They looked at their smartphone, but quickly became aware of a disquieting vibration emanating from the next lane over. Slowly but surely they turned their head, awakening from a torpor they scarcely believed they had occupied this long.</p><p>It was me they saw then as their lifetime of good fortune evaporated like E85 on spilled the open road. I was far away and yet all too close in the adjacent lane, rapidly feathering the throttle pedal to keep this cockamamie piece of shit from stalling, while using my left hand to hold the slightly-bent door closed tightly enough that the interior dome light wouldn’t flicker on.</p><p>Somewhere in Japan, a Honda executive shrieked in agony and suddenly arose from his desk. Reeling backward in the finest tradition of the Henshin Tigers, he hurled his desk plaque at an underling and began to bellow in rapid-fire Japanese, tinted with just a whiff of his rural upbringing.</p><p>“DISPLACEMENT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY,” he roared, causing his subordinate engineering pool to leap exactly one inch from their seats before falling back to Earth.<br/></p>

<p>A long time ago, in another life, I had a job at a soap company. My boss needed a new hit to keep his career going. He had struck it rich with bubble bath, he said, but that was over a decade ago and the vultures, fueled by the urgency of a bloated junk bond market, now circled above our parched heads.</p><p>Drinks. Women. Cocaine. The haze of battle. These things filled my days and my nights. There still was no hit product, and without one, our soap company would go bankrupt within weeks.</p><p>At last, in the foyer of a seedy motel, half-cut on $3 beer so ashamed of its quality it dared not even bear a brand name, it hit me. We would make an automated soap dispenser for public washrooms. To save money, it would only contain enough soap for maybe two or three squirts. Yes, that was it - everyone would read our logo, and know our name, as they glared impatiently at it, waving their hands, begging us to give them our product.</p><p>When I returned to the office as a conquering hero, my boss embraced me. We were on the way to victory, he said, blinking away teary eyes. We were on the way to success, the good life.</p><p>We, I said? I think you mean me, and gestured behind me to the waiting security guards. One of them carried a rumpled cardboard file box, filled with my boss’ personal effects.</p><p>Years later, I’m in a Dallas airport, wiping a streak of cocaine thick enough to serve as structural adhesive off my upper lip. I hear a familiar voice cursing the automated soap dispenser, its beady red eye flashing an insistent warning about a lack of soap in the reservoir. I can’t help but smile, my lips drawn back in a feral grin.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of things I didn’t tell you about my time in Asia. I’m not proud of any of them, to tell you the truth. But it feels like now might be the last time to confess. I committed a horrible act when I was down there.</p><p>When I received it, the job description was simple. “Car designer.” I could draw a picture of a car like the best of them, I figured, even if the portfolio I sent them was pretty much all freehand sketches of a Fiat 128 sedan on pizza cutters. Why mess with perfection, right?</p><p>To my surprise they loved my portfolio, and offered me the job. I was to fly to Korea, and begin work on a new project. They were really excited about it, and eventually my confusion and terror gave way to their excitement. I raced to the airport, ditching my trusty-but-rusty Isuzu Impulse RS in the park-and-fly lot, and strode valiantly onto the plane. As I passed the threshold of the airplane’s extending bridge, the 80s homage soundtrack in my Walkman settled upon the scene and softened its edge like snow on a fresh quarter panel dent.</p><p>I’d be lying to you if I told you I enjoyed air travel. A pharmacological treasure trove, liberated from a former renter of my two-level split, gave me both entertainment and relief on the lengthy flight. At last, the 767′s tires squealed angrily on foreign tarmac, and I was truly there.</p><p>My first day of work was the usual. Access cards, handshakes, PowerPoint presentations. It didn’t matter that my language skills were nonexistent or my automotive industry experience questionable, they accepted me as one of their own. Maybe that’s why they let me have so much rope.</p><p>When I returned to my company apartment, I dipped again into my medicine bag for a homewarming gift. Thus began a year-long haze I can even now scarcely remember, except through context and the half-remembered stories of my colleagues at the time. But at last the great project was done, and I reported to the local auto show for the vehicle’s unveiling.</p><p>It was a soiree to be sure. Champagne flutes, beautiful movie stars, the company’s executive branch, and a half-shaven, violently sweating white man in the middle of the crowd. The sheet lifted, and the room filled with gasps. My hands went numb as I saw what my corporeal body had been used as an unwitting vessel for.</p><p>I had designed the Ssangyong Rodius.</p><p>I will carry that guilt inside me forever.</p>

<p>They called him a master detective, and I guess he had been. He told me that in our initial interview, at first he was inclined to believe I was actually a legitimate surgeon. But I had tipped my hand, he said, when he saw that my surgical workbench had a can of PB Blaster on it.</p><p>It was easy for someone to brag about their detective prowess in retrospect, after the arrest was made, I spat.</p><p>We arrived at a deal. I would take him to where I had stored the bodies. On the way out, no unnecessary words passed between us. I stared dead ahead.</p><p>In the yard, he kept the gun on me. He was pretty bright, this one. It was obvious that I would have riddled my hidey-hole with all manner of exciting traps. I disarmed a few of them while glaring at him, and we went beneath.</p><p>The fluorescent lighting sprung to life, throwing out a shimmering halo onto all of my victims. At last I spoke. I knew what I had done wasn’t legal, but it would have been in just a few more years.</p><p>He looked at me, ran his hand along the ruby-red flanks and frowned.</p><p>I had cornered the market on Alfa Romeo 159s, smuggling them into the country in anticipation of the 15-year exemption. He had me dead to rights, an ant centered in the magnifying glass of justice.</p><p>The master detective spoke, overcome by a sheer, animalistic desire. “I’ll let you go in exchange for one of the turbo Sportwagons.”</p>

<p>I look into the eyes of the engineer from JPL, his face a wrinkled map of dissent and anger at this interloper in his midst. In front of me is a set of drawings of the moon rover. We&rsquo;re going to the moon. It&rsquo;s going to happen soon.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you line-bore the block or not, your old Chevy 305 is not going to work when there&rsquo;s no oxygen!&rdquo; he screams, furious.</p><p>I hit him. Hard. The ensuing line brawl pulls in half of my guys and the other half of his guys, the sounds of violence pulling them out of their frosted-glass offices and running into Conference Room F with fists balled.</p><p>Maybe a little introduction is necessary. I worked for a woman named Dr. Guillet, and our division was known as the Bad Boys of Aeronautics. We wore black, grew our hair long. She carried a guitar, brass knuckles, and an eyepatch she refused to acknowledge or talk about when questioned. It was inevitable that when Guillet was out, the other divisions of NASA would wonder why it was we got such special treatment and come to take our shit.</p><p>They’d find that she was there to restrain us, not to protect us. And so it was that fateful day in Conference Room F.<br/></p><p>In the end, the project to outfit the moon rover with a twin-supercharged high-mileage Chevy 305 didn’t really work out. Nobody knows why, but I suspect more boost would have helped produce the necessary oxygen to drive it.</p>

<p>This PTA meeting is as good of a chance as I’m going to get to explain my story. You all know me as the kindly auto shop teacher who came to town with a rattle-trap ‘63 Rambler wagon and not much else. But I have a dark past; a story about how I bankrupted Pick N Pull.</p><p>The boy working the counter had been surprised by my zeal. I could leave with <i>all</i> I could carry, for fifty bucks? Yes, he said. All you can carry.</p><p>I had looted my fill, but due to skipping leg day, arm day, back day and also exactly every other day at the gym, my load capacity was too low to maximally exploit the bounty I had discovered. What’s more, I could sense that more muscular professional mechanics were circling my hoard, ready for me to admit defeat. At once an idea came to me; I immediately began searching the yard for more necessary supplies. On this day, these jackals would not have the satisfaction.</p><p>Hours later, the same boy working the counter heard a strange noise. He had only worked at the Pick N Pull for a few months, but he was already innately aware of when a potential customer was a little off-kilter. Of course, he had read me properly from the start, my series of intense questions and heavily worn frequent parts-puller card setting off alarm bells.</p><p>The strange noise grew. That’s strange. It sounded almost like a V8. Bob, over in acquisitions, wasn’t supposed to be working today. He considered leaving his post, going to investigate, but decided as did many at the yard before him, to see where this goes on its own.</p><p>His curiosity was sated when I barged through the yard’s roll-up door, hissing and screaming, the sound of the twin scavenged 427s over each shoulder howling to redline as they provided sufficient motive force for the improvised exoskeleton I had fabricated. Behind me laid, I discovered later as the suspension and frame of my parts truck collapsed in the parking lot, over three thousand pounds of interior trim.</p><p>The hydraulic joints and pumps driving my suit wailed as I handed him fifty oil-stained dollars.</p><p>“Tell your boss this is cheaper in the long run,” I sneered at him from behind my steel-and-chrome protective face mask, twelve feet off the floor. “I won’t have to fill my pockets with clips anymore.”<br/></p>

<p>My travelling companion rapidly attempts to dial 911 on the 1980s-era car phone mounted in the centre console. I chuckle heartily, pulling the power leads free from the phone’s base with a shit-eating grin. We’re in this too deep, I explain, and it would be unethical to involve the police. Besides, they have no sense of humour.</p><p>I bury the throttle on the Road Runner, making the rear end axle-tramp its way into the drain lane of the highway. Against all form of logic, I continue to massage the gas as I early-apex the offramp, letting the twin-supercharged Max Wedge - more like SuperMax Wedge, am I right? - burp sparkling licks of cadmium flames from the fender-mounted exhaust cutout.</p><p>Before us laid the world’s true potential, a freedom denied to us by an accident of our birth. The Road Runner was an icon of it; its bounteous coke-bottle fenders and crude hood scoop striking a brutal contrast against the sea of pedestrian-safe, self-driving bubble cars that dove out of its way and made sweet love to the highway shoulder’s rumble strips. Those half-cars were scarcely able to comprehend the concept of an exhaust backfire; surely they imagined it to be some kind of solar flare or a police light gone wrong.</p><p>I laugh maniacally, forcing my companion even further into their carbon-backed bucket race seat. I have spotted my quarry, and today we ride with honour. My baby Plymouth responds with alacrity as I swing the tiller wide, ratcheting its ancient suspension over on its fat modern semi-slicks.</p><p>At last we have arrived. My travelling companion unlatches their door, leans out of the car, and vomits. I admire that willingness to protect what’s left of my interior, I tell them, as I begin my stride across the parking lot.</p><p>Surplus Mitutoyo calipers for half price were simply too good to pass up, and their siren song has lured me across this great land to take advantage.</p>

<p>When I went on my little jaunts to the rustic outskirts of my community, I always fixated on the machines. Abandoned, lonely, looking up at me with puppy-dog-eye headlights. I had to save them. I would start with this one, I reasoned. This little 15HP Sears would be coming home with me.</p><p>The owner looked at me, then at the filthy wad of ill-gotten lucre in my clenched fist, and then at last the tractor. Sure, he figured, I could take it, but it wasn’t running. It’s not like I could drive it home. He noted with some concern that my travelling companion had taken the J20 I arrived in, laying a patch at the end of his driveway and narrowly missing his charming rural supermailbox.</p><p>I turned to him then and I said, I guess you could say the problem is that there isn’t enough horsepower?</p><p>He agreed, stating that zero is not a very good amount of horsepower. Then he visibly reacted, his pupils dilating in the inherent fear response as he saw my mania ratcheting upwards like a B&amp;M on a 700R4 in June.</p><p>Hours later, I erupted from his rural forecourt, powered by a screaming Dorito. The previous owner hadn’t seen me unload my emergency 13B-REW from the back of the J20 prior to its unceremonious exit. It was always good to carry a spare for emergencies just such as this, I reasoned.</p><p>I could scarcely hear the Princess Auto lawn &amp; garden tires squirm beneath me over the physically painful sound of two hundred and fifty turbocharged horsepower shooting through the booger-welded diff.</p><p>That night, I slept like a baby; the ringing in my ears drowned out my inner monologue. I didn’t even notice the police sirens warbling outside my window, their presence summoned by my irate neighbors. Like none of them had ever mowed their lawn by emulating a 140 decibel Spirograph before.</p>

<p>Whenever I am at the unemployment office, they want to hear the story about how I was fired from U-Haul. Surely, nobody has ever been fired from <i><b>U</b></i>-Haul, they say, chuckling with that faint, vulturous leer that graces one&rsquo;s face when they catch a wafting tendril of amusing misfortune. What did I do, sleep with the owner’s daughter? Oh, it was much worse than that, I say through my teeth, pulling my lips back in a crude emulation of a human smile.</p><p>The year was 1994, and things were starting to heat up in the Tri-Delta Area (henceforth referred to as The Area). I had recently graduated at the top of my journalism class, and I was hitting the bricks of my hometown in search of the next great American story. Shoe leather be damned, it was time to uncover the secrets tucked away among the shaded glens and vacant lots of my fair land.</p><p>Within a few weeks, I discovered that shadowing local politicians and taking pictures of them in secret failed to deliver the pecuniary rewards that my British classmates had promised with their rosy cheeks and convincingly honest, rustic dentition. Even the local newspaper failed to pick up when I called to ask if they wanted to buy my pictures of the local mayor getting his tires rotated (not a euphemism, mind you - I thought he looked kind of fat in the waiting room and felt it would be newsworthy). </p><p>Perhaps long-form investigative journalism was more my forte.</p><p>On a tip from an informant, I was told that there was a self-storage yard loosely affiliated with U-Haul on the outskirts of town. Under the guise of a yet-to-be-employed recent graduate of journalism school, I applied to work the front counter. They accepted readily - perhaps <i>too </i>readily, my notes would say.</p><p>For three blissful months, I watched customers as they went to their self-storage units. Saw police raid them. Witnessed domestic disputes unfolding in their full ugly glory under the vandal-proof sodium streetlamps of the yard. My bosses were pleased with my work, and after a time, they permitted me approach to their sacred inner sanctum. I was promoted to work the trailer rental desk, a lofty leap made after my predecessor was pushed out due to a combination of showing up late to work and dealing distribution-level quantities of methamphetamine in the parking lot in broad daylight. </p><p>I should have known that it would not last.</p><p>That fateful morning, a customer arrived to pick up his trailer. I noticed that the trailer’s wheel bearings were completely dry, and the relatively new trailer was in generally poor maintenance. Frowning, I told the customer I would make it right immediately, and set about meticulously packing the wheel bearings for him as he waited. Fifteen minutes later, we hooked up the trailer and he was ready to go, visibly relieved that I was on his side. Safety was job one, I explained, making sure to evince that smart, quirky little smirk of television-inspired confidence that had long since replaced the old-fashioned suspender snap.</p><p>Once I was done, I looked up and saw my boss, Mr. Cho, fuming amid a boiling, twisting storm of barely restrained apoplexy. He was furious. I had inadvertently discovered the U-Haul Conspiracy, he erupted, waving a stack of personal-injury lawsuits in my face. What I had thought was simple incompetence went so much deeper, like cruel, twisting tendrils of melted rubber and the spalled curls of shredded bearings digging into the hands of the unwary. For every car hauler, every cargo trailer that had exploded on a major roadway, every ancient boxtruck that had abruptly become a tricycle, and each disaster that left a flaming trail of horrible death and destruction behind it, the franchise would earn a cut of in exchange for pointing personal-injury lawyers at U-Haul corporate’s door.</p><p>Mr. Cho levelled a snub-nose revolver at my face. Luckily, I was a student of journalism. I knew just what to do; my expert-level training took over.</p><p>“MY SOURCES ARE <i>CONFIDENTIAL</i>,” I shrieked, hurling the stapler from the desk at Mr. Cho’s face and leaping through the open office window to make good my escape.</p><p>He fired wildly at me as I tore ass out of the parking lot in my ‘82 Ford Durango, the mixed all-season meats out back squeaking and wailing for sympathy as I crossed the transom onto the highway and put miles between myself and the orange temple of the damned. I knew Mr. Cho would come looking for me, but I chuckled as I recalled the fantastical location I had put down on the employment paper, a private joke shared only with myself.</p><p>Only people who don’t live out of their car have addresses.</p><p>The unemployment officer heard my tale of woe, then asked me to repeat it to the clerk seated next to him, chortling loudly. Before long, the story was getting forwarded in primitive chain emails by howling employees, unable to focus on their duties through a mist of mirthful tears. Perhaps I had finally found my niche.</p>

<p>I didn’t understand why the nice fire inspector was telling me to stop putting my collection of heirloom gasoline in the apartment stairwell. Where else was I supposed to store it?</p><p>I argued with him for what seemed like hours, telling him that it was the only guaranteed non-ethanol fuel source still available. Think of the <i>carbs</i>, man. Nobody is helping the carbs! Eventually he left, issuing me with a hefty citation and a demand to immediately vacate the premises of my antique hydrocarbons.</p><p>On the road, I thought about what had happened. Usually a ride with my biker gang sorted me out straight, but the other members of the chapter could tell it was weighing heavily on my mind. At the next waystation, Our chapter president, Scarred Karl, at last decided to have a word about it with me. His 125cc Kymko People One gleamed at the head of our cruises; I was in awe of the way the massive chromed expansion chamber caught the light and played with it.</p><p>When I had told him the whole story, he looked down at my Yamaha Zuma and said simply: “It’s fuel injected, idiot.”</p><p>So as you can see, officer, these burnouts are simply to get rid of a leftover inventory of expensive commodities that I am no longer able to sell at a profit. In fact, I believe a tax receipt is in order?</p>

<p>The train beeped happily, rapid-firing a series of tones that would indicate those more clued-in to the system about its origin and destination. I felt no kinship with this train; I was just passing through. Regardless, I boarded, and we began our short journey together.<br/></p><p>Even now I can remember the other occupants of the train car in clear detail: the pensioner, the college students comparing photo albums, the bored nurse on her way home from the dark shift. The train emerged rapidly from its subterranean origins, climbing over the city, its pervasive neon glow settling into the condensation on the car’s polycarbonate windows.</p><p>At last my trip was complete, and the objective laid ahead in clear sight. The rain began to fall softly, drips and drabs washing clean the dusty surface of the train platform, shimmering jewels reflecting the high-impact-resistance pedestrian lights above.</p><p>I had met this service writer before; she spoke to me of the extent of the Takata airbag recall. Only through the unique benevolence of the Franco-Nissan Alliance had I been saved at the last minute from certain death. There was only one problem, she said, and then I heard it.</p><p>The service writer’s mouth continued moving, but any sounds it had made were indecipherable over the sheer density of the column of pure noise erupting from the Sentra’s external wastegates and electric exhaust cutout. I smiled.</p><p>Somewhere deep within the bowels of the customer parkade, a lot boy had just discovered his first taste of three hundred brake horsepower per liter. When he arrived to return to me the reins to my beast, I could tell he had been changed by that dark hand reaching from Hell itself, known only to those who followed his whims, Torque Steer.</p>

<p>Seat Safety Switch Industries was expanding to become a government and defense contractor. It was a hell of a rush, leading a megacorporation through the first uneasy steps of government procurement, purchasing the right senators, pushing the right acronyms into the right holes. But at last it was done, and I sat atop a throne covered in taxpayer dollars.</p><p>For years I had spoken out against the post office’s slow handling of my much-demanded car parts. RockAuto orders would take weeks to arrive, well past when my attention had already shifted to another project, another yearning need. Sometimes, high-end modified parts would simply go missing, requiring a re-ship and another project delay. Obviously, when the contract came up to modernize the post office’s gas vehicle fleet, Seat Safety Switch Industries was on it like R-compound marbles on the rear quarter panels of a Miata.</p><p>The prototype was easy enough to create. Ford had already done the hard work for me, and it only took a wrecked Focus RS, struck down at the peak of adolescent triumph. No investors would be upset at the excessive level of R&amp;D costs, not like the time when we started shipping a food processor built around a turbocharged GM 4.3L V6. Lawsuits were still pouring in on that one, but <i>this</i> project would put me right back on top. It had to.</p><p>Months later, rival zaibatsu and I had assembled to show off our vision of ground transport for the post office of tomorrow. Small-bore engines, three-wheeled scooters, robotic cars. I scoffed, audibly enough for one of my arch-rivals, “Professor” Thomas Goodhart, to call me out on the mat. Put up or shut up, he was saying. I smiled.</p><p>“Wait just one second,” I told him, and left the room. When I returned, all of them acted as if they had never seen a Ford Transit panel-van produce 500 wheel horsepower on a combination of environmentally-friendly E85 and nitrous oxide.</p><p>Amateurs.</p>

<p>It’s not that I’ve always been looking for the next mistake. It’s that I’ve always been running away from the last one. Last night, one of those old mistakes found me, naked and afraid, beneath the cold sky hanging atop the bay.</p><p>For years, my business partner and I had been the biggest suppliers of bootleg Pocari Sweat to the big city. We always kept it small, not wanting the inefficiencies of large-scale enterprise to catch up with us, distort our insights. That’s how the feds would notice us, and I knew that if they got a whiff, Inspector Koshiro wouldn’t be far behind. He had left his post back in the homeland and followed us, started a whole new police career. Koshiro wanted that collar in a way I’d never wanted anything before - and to be honest, he probably deserved it. I got the impression I was the first real challenge of his career, so many steps ahead of him his insistent belief in my very existence strained his relationship with his once-masters.</p><p>I’ve spoken before about my experiences with Mr. Cho, a man who put the <i>serial</i> in serial entrepreneur. Years ago, he found me and saw something in my talents, and he’d been turning the screws ever since. On this project, he was our financier. Mr. Cho - always <i>mister </i>with him - was pleased with our return on investment. I was the closest to safe I would ever feel around him on this job. He never smiled, but that was the way I liked it. I don’t think I could deal with whatever was behind a Mr. Cho smile.</p><p>The night leading up to the incident at the bay is still fuzzy in my mind; plying my companionship in trade for high-powered single-shot vending machine espressos will only get you so far. But what I am prepared to say is that I made a lot of bad choices when it came to motor vehicles. One such bad choice was my shopworn Minica. Not just an ordinary model, it started life as a Dangan ZZ before a very talented shop-hand transformed the already overachieving five-valve 660cc weed-whacker engine into a sleeper so subversive only dogs could hear its true nature.</p><p>I was hammering the car through what I later discovered to be a protected public park. The Minica’s bad-tempered all-wheel-drive system scrabbled at the degraded cobblestone and gravel pavement, keeping my ass out of the ditch as I swung it through gardens and half-covered rest areas, their electroluminescent recycling bins leaving a glowing streak of pure colour in my night vision.</p><p>My rear view mirror was suddenly filled by a Nissan President, bearing down upon me. Had I more occasion to study the curves of the car, I would have noticed the chopped fenders, crude high-offset mud-terrain tires and deftly spliced 4WD system from a Patrol, but at the time it was hard to see any detail other than the immense Weiand blower sticking through the hood. Using the twin skills of deduction and hamfootedness that had gotten me this far, I correctly inferred the intent of my pursuer, and took flight.</p><p>Cranking the wheel, I deked hard right, barreling through the entrance and exit doors of a nearby public washroom, the Minica’s mirrors taking only a slight beating from the ornamental wood trim of the door frames. The pursuing Patrol President obliterated the building on impact, scattering brickwork and corrugated sheet metal about the clearing. I had bought myself only a small amount of time, and opted to abandon the Minica and make good my escape on foot, aided by thermoptic camouflage. </p><p>Throwing my cloned Italian suit into the bushes, I disappeared from the visible and infrared spectrums like a naked man slipping into the forest after crashing his over-turbocharged AWD kei car. That old cliche again, I thought as I crouched behind a retaining wall, only feet from the machine-pistol toting hired goons who had been sent for me.</p><p>I heard a sound then, a staccato ripping through the wooded surroundings, and one of the goons fell from the retaining wall before me, his face a theatre mask of surprise. </p><p>“Funny meeting you here,” said Inspector Koshiro, his face ringed by a Google Glass set to electromagnetic isolation. “You should really get a faster car.”<br/></p><p>He gestured with his sub-<i>c</i> rail pistol at the bastard President, surrounded by the dismantled bodies of my recent opponents, and then returned to pointing the gun at me. “Looks like this one just came on the market.”</p><p>All business, Koshiro was, even when he was pointing a future-tech handgun at an invisible naked man in a public park.</p>

Daybreak above the heart of the new west.<br/></p><p>

The wind, for once, is impossibly calm.  There are ReMax hot air balloons that haven&rsquo;t seen action in fifteen years filling their sightly tattered and lovingly repaired air bags on an open field in the industrial heart of town.<br/></p><p>

Truly, a God is with me as I begin my quest.<br/></p><p>

A call to the local aerodrome a fortnight earlier cemented my resolve and secured the services of a local pilot, William &ldquo;Crackerjack&rdquo; Flurrey and his trusty steed, an Avro Anson trainer.<br/></p><p>

Watching from the comfort of the pilot&rsquo;s lounge after an exchange of an obscene amount of cash and a scribbled diagram with a simple two character string, I relax, knowing that my divine task is nearly complete.<br/></p><p>

The Anson struggled into the air, its ancient airframe groaning under the weight of the oil smoke tanks, the radial engines designed in the same year that my grandfather wore diapers still somehow functioning, decades past their obsolescence.<br/></p><p>

The pilot spends twenty minutes sculpting my request.  Huge billowing lines form the holy alphanumeric code.  He is nearly finished when the surprise I planted in his plane detects that the oil tanks are nearly empty.<br/></p><p>

A huge explosion rocks his starboard nacelle.  Big enough to destroy the engine, but small enough to keep the wing mostly intact.  At the same time, the throttle for the port motor sticks at wide open.<br/></p><p>

Bill Flurrey unwittingly performs the first perfectly executed aerial donut in world history as he spirals towards mother Earth against the backdrop of three kilometer high letters.<br/></p><p>

V8<br/></p><p>

My job finished, I vanished into the ether. Perhaps I would one day return, but only if Fury Road cleaned up at the Screen Actor&rsquo;s Guild awards.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to raise a kid in today’s society, I know. The Internet, Elves on Shelves, iPads, bookmobiles. How can you control how your kids will act when they’re away from you? Often, the responsibility falls to me, a mere public school teacher.</p><p>

&ldquo;GET SOME,&rdquo; I shriek as the paddlewheel tires dominating the rear tubs of the Viscount bite into the football field, hurling clumps of rubber-caked mud at the assembled children. McGruff the Crime Dog has taken off from his post, running with his head covered for the relative safety of the stereotypically-ethnic food truck.

<p>I let the small town have both barrels of the rev limiter as I streaked out of it like a neon chariot ensconced in a gentle bed of purifying hellfire. These rubes would never know the true value of what I had taken from them, myself the liberator of out-of-town Kijiji finds.</p><p>When I found it, I could not believe my eyes. A Jeep Commando, in a small town. Surely someone else would have visited by now, forked money into their faces, purchased it. It was not to be. It was <i>available</i> and what’s more, it was waiting. If I’m honest - which I rarely am - it felt like fate, dragging me towards the town and the inevitable showdown.</p><p>I hadn’t noticed I was running from something until I finally stopped. The town was still, peaceful, serene. Everyone who lived there seemed at ease with their lot in life, their struggle ceased by a dense blanket of good living that had settled upon the town at some point. They would file into the faux-Chinese restaurant next to the town hall for community dinners and pancake breakfasts, they would go to a church none of them could control, they would write op-eds in the town newsletter about whether or not visitors sped too much on the main drag.</p><p>If you asked me if I was tempted to stay, I would be a liar if I told you I wasn’t. Things seemed better here. The kind of place you could have a Jeep Commando and it didn’t really matter very much if the brakes worked.</p><p>As the winch was pulling the Jeep onto my ghetto-recovery flatbed, I asked the owner about how much he paid for internet access. He looked at me with sad eyes and I knew in my heart what the answer would be.</p><p>“We don’t have the internet here,” I imagine he said as I lit the massive Detroit off under the hood of my bagged K30 tow vehicle and departed from his life.<br/></p>

<p>Through the fires I saw Kevin James, laughing, as he left through the only unblocked door. I realized I was going to have to make a move, and fast.</p><p>Grabbing the script to &ldquo;We Defrauded a Zoo,&rdquo; I fired my Apple Watch&rsquo;s wrist mounted grappling piton and lifted myself to the second floor.</p><p>I push through the flames, throwing myself through a tight gap between the main beam and a support that had fallen in the roaring inferno. Through the melting leaded glass of the storage loft’s only window, I can see Kevin James climbing aboard his Vespa ET3 and disappearing into the wavy California air.</p><p>There was surely no way I could escape my burning grave, let alone catch up with the wayward star to retrieve the manuscript. I sank to my knees and prayed to the god of torque, his infinite torsional force driving all things as it does the Earth. When I opened my eyes, I saw the distinctive fender of a battered but beloved Honda CT90, left in my studio years ago during what must have been a moped bender.</p><p>Jumping the CT90 from the second-storey window, a Phoenix-like cascade of broken glass behind me, I knew that if Kevin James wanted to get to Hollywood with that script, he was going to have to go through a focus group consisting of me.</p>

<p>The 80s homage soundtrack whines pitifully out of the zip-tied Bluetooth speaker sitting on the cracked dash pad. Outside the drivers’ window is a rain-drenched neon hellscape, and I was smack dab in the middle of it. I stretched my fingers, pulled the driving gloves back taut, and fired up the bored (in more ways than one) Buick 462 to prepare to pull out into traffic.</p><p>I was on my way to the hardware store to pick up some gear for the work-on-shit-slash-barbeque meet, and of course it was a cold and wet day to do it. Never mind, I thought, as I punched the groaning olive-drab Skylark into the next gear and pulled its surprisingly eager weight towards an on-ramp.</p><p>The city unfolds beneath me, riding atop a perfect asphalt flyover, a train track suspended in midair by the neon promise of the world beneath. I can’t help myself but to sing along with the humming of the Skylark’s massive drag radials, rain and pebbles bouncing against the thin sheet gauge of the rear tubs.</p><p>Red and blue fireworks explode in my rear view mirror. Routine traffic stop, I figured. Maybe a blown out tail light. Nothing to arouse suspicion. I pull to the side of the road, slow my panicky breathing. I’ve done this before, and I see no reason to think this time will be any different.</p><p>“Could you please open the trunk, sir?” asked the police officer.<br/></p><p><i>Shit</i>. Someone tipped them off. I contemplated flight, burying the throttle and letting the big Buick take over, but I doubted my abilities to escape the dragnet that was undoubtedly closing in on me. There were likely surveillance drones and mag-mount tracking antennas on every square inch of the Skylark, and I didn’t have the time to get away and remove them at the same time. At last, I begrudgingly reached beneath the dashboard and pulled the remote trunk release. Whoever this cop was, he had hit the jackpot; his career would be fringed in gold evermore.</p><p>I heard a muffled whump as the trunk lid flapped to its extents on the hinge springs. Resigned to my fate, I wondered which of my jailhouse lawyer friends would be the most likely to not screen calls from me.</p><p>The officer stood, staring with disbelief into the cavernous trunk, filled to the brim with spark-plug non-foulers.</p>

<p>I knew I had pissed off Captain Siffredi back at the precinct, but I didn’t realize quite how much until I got my latest assignment. There was a gang of import drag racers menacing society on the way back from their Friday night events, and he wanted me there. The only problem was, I didn’t understand anything about not-torque.</p><p>As I pulled into the bustling tech lineup at the weekly drags, one of the gaggle stepped forward. He made note of my bumper sticker, which proudly read “DRIVER CARRIES ONLY 7000 RPM.” To these people, eighty-five-hundred rpm redlines belonged more on tractors. They sought the insane motorbike pleasure of quintuple-digit formula car wails and got there with lightened flywheels, decreased valvetrain mass, and other illegal street hop-up drugs I had been sent to stop.</p><p>Forced induction, kids, I would say to high school students when visiting. Forced induction is the way to greater power. We must back away from the old era of repeatedly banging off stratospheric rev limiters while making dogs bark. It must be done to protect mother Earth, and also because you can crank up the boost and make like 200whp more before the head gasket walks. But that’s beside the point. Sorry, sometimes I get off on a rant.</p><p>My newfound companion, who we’ll call Dixie Steve because I don’t actually remember what his name is or read my own handwriting on the arrest report, invited me out after the event. The rest is history, including the part where I turned on my own law enforcement comrades because Dixie Steve had a pretty bitchin’ FC RX7 in his backyard he told me I could tow out for a grand.</p>

<p>The inmate towered over me. He asked me what I was in for. Speeding. He looked at me in genuine surprise. A <i>lot</i> of speeding, I explained calmly, gesturing as if the entire jail cell was occupied entirely by the physical manifestation of my malfeasance.</p><p>My new prison bunkmate wasn’t exactly the happiest man I’d ever met. We got to talking about our respective misdeeds on day two, as you do. He was in for murder, which was a crime that involved a lot of prep work that he didn’t want to do. Through a series of perfunctory discussions I determined that he, too, was in for a <i>lot</i> of murder. We were practically twin brothers, separated at birth. I told him so, and received a grimace followed by an explanation that he had killed his actual twin brother as well.</p><p>“In fact,” he said, adopting a practically scholarly posture for an eight foot tall slab of meat covered in scars, “I have tattoos with the names of everyone I’ve killed.”<br/></p><p>“Oh, I do too,” I laughed. “I do too.”<br/></p><p>Later that day, it was time for the showers. My newly made friendship was on the rocks. He pointed at the tattoos covering every square inch of my body. There was only one question on his mind.</p><p>“Who’s EJ25?”<br/></p>

<p>Wherever he was, Frank Zamboni was probably smiling down upon me at this very minute. I was putting his dream into action, and making the world safer for everyone. As I raised the blade and left the roadway, I heard the sound of plastic body panels dimpling under the strain of high-speed impacts and smiled.</p><p>My story starts last summer, at the heavy industrial auction. I had come in the hopes of getting a massively-discounted luxobarge, purchased for some executive that had departed the company under unfortunate circumstances when fingered for fraud. What I found instead in the sale lot of a local hockey arena was a battered, worn Model 440.</p><p>From the first moment I laid eyes on the ol’ 440, I knew that I had to have it. Approaching it on the pre-sale docket, I could smell a whiff of caked propane mingling with perfectly aged hydraulic oil. It smelled like a project, for sure, but I didn’t realize what the project would be until this morning.</p><p>Arising from my bed, I looked out the window to gain a basic visual recon on the presence and status of all my street-parked hoopties. I found the street covered in a pristine blanket of white snow. A Hyundai Santa Fe was stuck atop the Lord’s shimmering bounty, endlessly spinning its front wheels in an attempt to motivate its bald all-seasons up the steep hill of my street. Something broke inside me then.</p><p>Minutes later, I found myself expertly piloting the Zamboni with a deft touch, resurfacing the streets of my commute into a sheen of solid ice. When I looked into the reservoir, rapidly filling with the salt slurry that in weaker times threatened my rear quarter panels and rockers, I smiled. Tonight I would have the roads to myself, their frozen carapace punctured by the grotesquely illegal ice-racing studs on my window-netted Acadian Scooter. Everyone else could just stay at home, huddle in the dark and tell each other reassuring stories about how decade-old all-seasons with 1/32″ of tread were fine if you were careful and went 50 under.</p><p>As I prepared to leave the Zamboni in my office parking lot and embrace the modern vice of central heating, I hesitated for a second. I stood atop the seat and looked out over my great work, the wailing sirens distant and incapable of reaching me.</p>

<p>I saw one too many Dodge commercials and I knew it was time to visit the Founding Fathers. But my time machine gently malfunctioned, and instead I awoke in a damp sweat, my pants around my ankles, and clutching an LS7. The day only got better from there.</p><p>Colonial America wasn’t that great, to be honest. It was nothing at all like I had been led to believe by Disneyland, that most boastful of protofascist vacation spots. For one thing, there were absolutely no churro stands. Also, it smelled a lot like poop.</p><p>Burying my engine stand and LS7 appropriately beneath some hay in a horse stable, I set out to look for the Founding Fathers. With my knowledge of internal combustion and basic civics education, we would turn back the clock on my depraved era and start a new, better, America. It would not collapse as my timeline did, its institutions overwhelmed by apathy and corruption.</p><p>After a series of extremely boring events, I was able to meet Benjamin Franklin, the most valuable of all the Fathers. If anyone would understand the vagaries of the LS7, I reasoned that it would be him. Upon informing him of my discovery and my journey here, we made haste to the horse barn.</p><p>Once we were there, Benjamin Franklin stared at its luscious heads, its gleaming cam gear and beefy double-row aftermarket timing chain. I explained the four-stroke combustion cycle, the intricacies of aftermarket parts, exhaust and intake tuning, the secrets of power. Franklin looked at this, eyed me up, and smiled. I could sense that the future was already changing from my actions. I would be hailed as a revolutionary, engraved in folk legend as a soothsayer from parts unknown.</p><p>

Later, as I was converting an ox-cart into a time machine using improvised Leyden jars, hay, and horse shit, Benjamin Franklin returned. He had spoken to the other Fathers and had exciting questions for me. I could sense his desperation, his need to know. I smiled. Science and engineering would build a new world using curiosity as its stone.<br/></p><p>At last he asked: “So how do you get good fuel economy?”</p><p>It struck me suddenly. The Founding Fathers were fools. We had built institutions that enshrined mere men and held them up as gods. Democracy was a crude sham perpetrated upon us by our societal betters, their thrones built atop piled corpses.</p>

<p>I asked the man from the government if there would be cars where he wanted me to go.</p><p>“Oh no,” he said, excited, “there will be no need for cars on the colony ships. We’ll be driven anywhere we want to go by autonomous trains. No traffic jams anymore!”<br/></p><p>“If what you’re telling me is true, there won’t be any traffic jams here either.” I closed the door in his face, and lit my e-cigarette, the smell of burning R-compound rubber filling my nostrils.</p><p>I’m not sure who I’m telling this story to, but it seemed important that I write it down anyway. Once, we made some mistakes. We made a lot of mistakes, and our world died. Billions of people were shuffled onto the colony ships, off to spread humanity throughout the universe.</p><p>I didn’t join them. I want to say it was because of some kind of idealized independent existence, to be a strong man living off the land.</p><p>Saying that would be lying to you. I actually stayed for the cars. As the world’s water evaporated, leaving dried lakebeds behind, it exposed ancient cars. Even submerged for decades, they were nicer than what I was driving around. It seemed a shame to waste them.</p><p>I looked up into the sky as I fastened the tow hooks to the corroded frame of the Celica. Overhead, a straggler colony ship escaped our orbit, off to a better place. Whatever conflict I felt in my heart was quickly evaporated as the crane attached to my five ton lifted the 80s Toyota overhead - this one had an LSD.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Ken Stone,&rdquo; says Ken Stone, climbing over the dealer principal&rsquo;s desk, &ldquo;and I have come to right a particular wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Nobody who witnessed it could tell me what had happened that fateful day. at first, we figured PTSD, but a panel of clinical psychologist assays revealed that they were in perfect mental health except for the peculiar amnesia that had settled into them all.</p><p>Later, we discovered they had forgotten other parts of their lives as well. children&rsquo;s faces, their spouses&rsquo; names, in one case even how to walk. it was if this Ken joker had broken them utterly at some part of their core being.</p><p>The investigation took a strange turn when we checked the security cameras. Where we expected to find a normal car arriving, we instead found some kind of ex-military vehicle, blocking out the optics and then frying them individually by pumping them full of frequency-encoded strobe light across all spectrums. The few cameras that were resistant to a brute-force buffer overflow attack soon fell to the raw quantity of EM pumped directly into their undersized factory-second capacitors.<br/></p><p>A man from the NSA came to us in the early days of the inquest. He had nothing to say to us, just wanted a copy of the data. I was happy for the help, take this sick man off the streets. We found the man from the NSA stripped clean, his bone marrow separated mechanically with a Harbour Freight angle grinder.</p><p>At last, operating on a tip, I found myself in the backwoods of assachusetts.</p><p>I came across a brand new house, rising above the wreckage, gleaming and fresh in the middle of a field of Jeeps.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember what happened afterward.</p><p>All I remember was walking down the footpath to his front door, and then&hellip; suddenly I&rsquo;m looking at Subaru Justies on craigslist. What the hell even is a Subaru Justy?</p>

<p>When I was a kid, just fresh out of school, I got a job at a local vending machine company. My job was to track down the non-compliant vending machines and retire them. I liked to call myself the Blade Runner, but my boss later told me that there was a corporate policy against giving yourself a bad-ass science fiction nickname.</p><p>Back then, things were rougher. The budgets were low; margins were down because of currency fluctuations or whatever. The result is, I didn’t have a partner. I hear you, modern vending machine mechanics - you’re in shock. How could anyone be so callous with their own life? Well, that’s just how it was done back then. Sit down and listen.</p><p>I was called out to an old military barracks that was now in peacetime an extremely low rent office complex. Slimy ambulance-chasing law firms, fly-by-night academic publishing scams and artisanal telemarketing operations were all under these roofs. But they had nothing to do with me. My job was to fix the facility operator’s harem of priceless Pepsi machines and secure that sweet, sweet margin for him evermore.</p><p>My first target was simple - a 1983 “Classic” Vendomatic. These babies would never lie to you. Straightforward, upright, and only occasionally containing an entire intact beehive, these machines were the bread and butter of my operations. Simple job. The coin mechanism’s slug rejector had gotten dirty, its counterweights seized against their throw. I was out of there so fast the machine’s door was still swinging closed as I left the room.</p><p>The rest of the day pretty much went as expected. I was beginning to get bored with the simple tasks held here; they were basic maintenance that anyone could do, rather than call in the specialized services of a tier-one operator such as myself. I checked my notebook again, and only one machine stayed outstanding.</p><p>I arrived in a dark, dead-ended hallway, the only illumination coming from the vending machine at the end. Maybe it was my imagination, but I could feel the walls and ceiling closing in as I walked slowly to the end of the hallway and met the machine’s glance. It was one of those pseudosentient military machines, built back during the last Great War to anticipate dietary needs and adapt the mixture of soft drinks in real time to keep soldiers healthy.</p><p>Removing the front cover of the vending machine, I saw the “last serviced” sticker. It was George May, a legend in the vending machine repair business and my mentor. He had gone missing a decade previous, about the same time this sticker was placed. Could this have been the last machine he worked on? I shook the thought out of my head as I continued my meticulous failure analysis. Machines like this took a lot more study; their processing cores were so sophisticated and their mechanicals so hardened it was difficult to work a simple job on them. Trainees who leapt before they looked frequently ended up with brutal refrigerant burns, or long-term hallucinations from inadvertently scraping up against the battlefield-amphetamine injectors.</p><p>At long last, the cause of the symptoms presented themselves. Of course, it had to be the positronic motivator matrix. I reached out to touch it, and heard the voice of George May, clear as day, echoing down the hall. No. Had he done it?</p><p>I cleaned the contacts and powered the machine back up. Sure enough, it responded in the voice of George May.</p><p>I want to tell you that I did something to rescue my trapped mentor. I want to tell you that I figured out who was occupying his human body after that fateful service call. I want to tell you that I did anything other than get back in my Astro panel van, drive all the way home and weep openly in the tub.</p><p>If you find this note, please remember: I made sure to submit my invoice and get reimbursed.</p>

<p>I was no economist; when all is said and done, that’ll be the first sentence of my tell-all biography. But I had an idea. I saw the decline of gold-backed currencies and the dropping oil prices, and I decided to set me up one hell of a hedge. People needed to know: BurnoutCoin invented <i>itself</i>. I was merely the vessel for its magnificence.</p><p>The concept is simple: burnouts are your currency. A one-tire-fire is worth less than a staggering block-long parallel flamer, you get the idea. If you can’t make your own burnouts, you can give a high school student with a fox body ten bucks to do ten bucks worth of burnouts. Shit makes sense, right? I’m practically G. William Miller.</p><p>Anyway, things took off more than I expected. I was starting to spend more on tires than I was getting back from Burnoutcoins; a trip to the bank would make my throat close up and my eyes water from the quad-engined nitro-burning top fuel dragsters that did burnouts in the back parking lot. The fintech guys had gone nuts, of course; quants climbing over bastardized monster machines that could do more burnouts, faster. Six, eight, ten sets of wheels connected to ludicrous engines.</p><p>All I can say is, it’s a good thing I held onto the first million Burnoutcoins when all I needed to do was let off a torque-steering squeaker from an economy car to net ‘em. A week of commuting later, and now I receive the chairman of the World Bank for dinner at my solid-gold luxury yacht.</p>

<p>It was a little hard to get so many angry phone calls from the President. That’s a sentence I couldn’t have written back in my hungry-journalist days. That is, before the <i>movement</i>.</p><p>Let me back up a little. You already know about my time with <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>. You know about the moped cult. Someone probably told you about the infamous Nissan-Infiniti Dealership Shootout. But did you ever wonder where the tipping point was, where the world economy finally ceased its breathless struggle upward and rolled inexorably backward like a teenager learning to drive stick?</p><p>I certainly do; if you find out, you’re a better journalist than me, because I was <i>there</i>. I saw things fall apart, the masses yearning to taste an authentic life, scooping up any and all long-form writing about automotive adventures, learning that there were things they could actually change with effort, the rediscovery of this great land as a nitro-choked adolescent playground.</p><p>The magazine and my ethos both spoke to a deep-seated resentment in the common man for the hand he had been dealt: it didn’t take long before they realized that society was just like any one of the hundreds of machines I had told them how to take apart. So they did, stripping wires and pulling gears, tugging the broken parts free with pliers crudely wrapped in electrical tape. But I can’t tell you when it happened. I can only tell you that it happened, and how. We are here now, and that’s the context in which the President called me up.</p><p>He was angry - it was un-Presidential to be this volatile - about the total collapse of the North American economy. Naturally, he blamed me. It wasn’t my fault, I explained, it was the fault of the common man deciding that forty hours a week was the sucker’s end of the bargain. The President had lifted off the brake ever so slightly in response - sympathy? It was hard to tell - and now its surge was way too strong to be stopped.</p><p>I stepped out onto my balcony after that phone call, and I looked out onto the street. Below me, two heavily modified 60s Mopars tore down the street, farm-implement megadiesels jutting out of what was left of their front frame rails. As apocalypses go, this one wasn’t so bad.</p>

<p>I hated to go to these conferences. Perky magazine-types, clawing at their eyes and fighting each other to the death for the greasy wrinkled twenty I would throw onto the boardroom table between them. I sneered, leaned back in the hotel conference centre’s auction-chic Aeron chair, and dispensed a nugget of wisdom from my time as the star writer of <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>.</p><p>“You guys got it all wrong,” I mutter like an asshole, tapping my carbon-fiber-imitation butane lighter against my chin, sneaking furtive glances at the projector system’s wiring to see if there was any unshrinken heat shrink that needed my help. It did so satisfy me: like a half-breed coupling between popping bubble wrap and setting fire to an orphanage.</p><p>A man at the end of the table introduced himself, deferred to my greater knowledge. He worked for a quarterly publication about <i>good</i> cars. His coworkers had all just been laid off, and he was the last writer left behind. Him and the editor-in-chief on their own floor of the parent company, bouncing article ideas off one another all day. Just the idea of it made me want to vomit. He wanted my advice, like I said. I didn’t hold forth.</p><p>“The first thing you gotta do,” I said, pointing to the presentation screen, now filled with the 4K video I was beaming through every television on the hotel’s thoroughly penetrated local network, “is diversify.”<br/></p><p>On the screen before us flickered a million bright lights making out an image of man’s greatest achievement: the AMC Gremlin X.</p><p>“Gentlemen and ladies,” I spoke gravely, rising from my perch on the edge of the cherrywood conference table, “you may have heard of <i>lifestyle</i> magazines. Many of you probably write for them.” I was circling the table now, placing my hand in a mentor-like pose on each victim’s - <i>participant’s</i> - shoulder.<br/></p><p>“They’re aspirational, sure. But have you considered going the other way?”<br/></p><p>The screen finally flickered to the graveyard of garbage cars I kept at the <i>BCM </i>office’s largely abandoned parking lot. It was drone footage, recorded this morning so as to not allow any pretence of having been staged. The sun rose over the rusted-out flanks of Mavericks, Yugos, long-discontinued and -disavowed Suzukis. I could hear the audible gasps around the table - I was living the journalist dream. The <i>truth</i> was here in front of them. In times long past, great men died for truth like this.</p><p>“Welcome to the dawn of the <i>good enough</i> lifestyle magazine.”<br/></p>

<p>So I was at the burrito hut. But next door is a Wendy’s. In the parking lot of the Wendy’s, I saw a four-door Saab 900. What kind of man owns a four-door Saab 900? I decided to find out.</p><p>I saw a neckbeard leave the Wendy’s, his steps in the soft snow muffling the laboured breathing required to produce them. I thought, yes, this must be the situation. It’s the only way. He got into a Corolla and drove away.</p><p>I was so stunned, I almost missed my quarry. Behind him, a perfectly normal looking guy - someone who looks <i>like me</i> - got into the Saab, started it effortlessly, and departed the parking lot. But as he was leaving, despite my best judgment, I made eye contact and I didn’t like what I saw inside those eyes. He knew.</p><p>That night, I laid awake. I knew that at any moment I would hear a Saab H-series motor burbling gently up my block, my front doorknob rattling from a Alibaba pick gun, the sound of a Harbour Freight Earthquake impact gun resting gently against my temple. He just couldn’t afford the competition for weird beaters, I expected.</p><p>But nothing happened that night. Or for many more nights after that. I decided I would lure him out. On Craigslist, I posted a false ad for a Messerschmitt 3-wheeled microcar. I knew he wouldn’t be able to resist, and when he showed up, I’d take him out before he got a fair shot at me.</p><p>I sat in my tree stand, disguised as a Ford Taurus, and awaited. Eventually, an Opel GT arrived, and the owner got out. But it wasn’t the Saab guy. Was there more competition than I had expected?</p><p>My answer came quickly. I heard the click of a ratcheting breaker bar behind me, and then the sharp <i>ping</i> of a shorn bolt head. I turned and looked. Down the block, I noticed instantly, was a Falcon Futura. And in the Taurus tree stand with me was the Saab guy.</p><p>“You really thought I wouldn’t notice a first generation SHO?”<br/></p>

<p>This was it, I thought, the <i>federales</i> had finally figured out it was me. They had hired some kind of wunderkind boy detective, just a kid fresh out of school, used sophisticated pattern-matching, Homeland Security black-ops assets, neural nets. That’s how they figured me out, I’m pretty sure. It couldn’t have been something as simple as the pissed-off little old lady who lived next door who called me in for doing donuts on her lawn in my bitchin’ Camaro.</p><p>But where I expected a noose, instead was a helping hand. They would get me the therapy I needed, they would encourage a work-release program. What kind of work, I asked.</p><p>Before me sat hundreds of bored high schoolers. I became all too aware of the squeaking rubber of the soles of my Pilotis on the high-impact wood gym floor. A few minutes passed as the principal gave the introductions, talked me up to them. I could tell that a few of them, the keeners and the burnouts alike, had taken notice of the vibe I was projecting. At last I was allowed to speak.</p><p>Behind me, a massive projection screen clicked through my slides as I told them about the things I had seen. I had been forced by the government to teach kids about safe engineering. The Chinese were beating the shit out of us, they explained, and they needed someone to get kids excited about building things again. I was here to preach to these kids, to teach them there was a good book, full of answers. That book was Advanced Materials in Automotive Engineering, and it carried the good Word of Carbon Fiber.</p><p>As the sermons progressed, I would be gripped by the fervour of All-Consuming Torque, and leap from my podium to speak to the kids who got it, one on one. Their eyes would fill with glee, and they would hang on my every word, eyes flitting from my face to the slide where I teach kids how to do dry-layup carbon fiber in your garage with just an old refrigerator compressor.</p><p>Did my methods work? Well, you’d have to ask the squadron of highly-trained automotive engineers who would die for me with just a word. You’d have to ask the Feds, who figured out their hubris too late to stop me.</p><p>Atop my throne of machined billet shortblocks, the boy detective was brought to me. I considered him for a long time, rocking back and forth in the surprisingly-uncomfortable 6061 seat.</p><p>“Machine learning,” I said at last, my lips curling into a devil’s smile. “Can you build a traction control system that doesn’t suck?”<br/></p><p>“No,” he spat, “it’s impossible. People should just learn to fucking drive.”<br/></p><p>I outstretched my hand in a gesture of friendship. “Welcome aboard, son.”</p>

<p>You could be forgiven for assuming I only loved to drive terrible cars. It’s not true. I love to drive <i>excellent</i> cars, but terrible cars is all they give me. Once, I drove the finest car of all: the one and only 1987 Skoda Rapid 136. When you get the opportunity to drive a car like this, you take it.

</p><p>I was on vacation when I got the call. It was <i>Bad Cars Monthly</i>, the successful monthly magazine about bad cars I wrote at for a living. Specifically, it was my editor in chief, and he wanted me to give the founder’s perspective on the fastest Eastern European hotrods money could build. He asked me if I wanted to drive a nitromethane-burning twin-supercharged Rapid with a 347 stroker in its ass.</p><p>On the way back to the office, I was told by a police officer that my rate of travel was so high that it had broken his radar gun. I frowned. I hadn’t injected those buffer overflows into the radar jammer’s PWM signature so I could talk to <i>more</i> police officers. At least I had root on the traffic camera system now, I told myself as the officer finished tallying up my equipment-violation ticket, the Manta’s speedometer permanently frozen at a reasonable highway cruising speed.</p><p>As for the car, the Rapid 136 was a fine automobile to begin with, but with an extra thousand or so horsepower, it became <i>sublime</i>. In the final article, I waxed eloquent about the beautiful handling, the vintage lines, the hand-beaten panels, the rear-engined traction on corner exit. I loved it so much, I even finished the article <i>before</i> the print deadline.</p><p>On my way out of the office and back to my vacation, the EIC tapped me on the shoulder. The company lawyer was with him, and boy was she pissed.</p><p>“Is there a reason your traffic-ticket legal budget is almost completely unspent this month?” she asked.<br/></p><p>“I started wearing a low-cut blouse,” I explained to her, opting not to explain the breadth and depth of my control of the mechanisms of automated law enforcement. “Works like a charm.”<br/></p>

<p>My machete sliced effortlessly through the thick carpet of vegetation that had overrun the junkyard. At last, my prize: the Last Geo Storm Wagonback. I held my breath as I looked over its angular Nipponese flanks, so well formed for efficiency in parking and maximum storage quantity.</p><p>They would pay a pretty penny for this back in the Ozarks, I thought as I attached the ratcheting come-along to its flimsy shipping hook. Maybe the College of Bad Cars would want to feature the Storm in their museum of misses. It belonged there, I believed.</p><p>I heard a crack of discarded trim panels underfoot, and turned to look behind me. It was Houston Mare, a rival automobile archaeologist from the college on the other side of the tracks. And he wasn’t alone.</p><p>Flanked on both sides by German car mechanics carrying tools I could barely recognize, he tilted his head back and laughed in triumph. I had done all the work, he explained. I had led him right there. He wanted me to turn over the Wagonback, to leave with my life.</p><p>But if you had done all the work yourself, you wouldn’t have made the mistake you made, I explained to Houston. As his face contorted in confusion, his fellow mechanics gripped their triple-square sets tighter and began looking for potential exits. Too slow, motherfuckers.</p><p>As the 4G63-swapped D50 on the other end of the come-along did a savage peel-out at the hands of my research assistant, the Wagonback bowled them over with impunity. I leapt into the Geo’s smashed passenger-side window as it tore past, and hoped that the now-dented front fenders would interchange with the coupe model.</p><p>I looked into the rear view mirror to see Houston Mare latched onto the roof rails for dear life, screaming in some half-breed mixture of German and Creole profanity. The only thing he got in response was my shit-eating grin as I violently countersteered the Storm, engaging the steering column lock, and sending him directly into a pile of recently-returned EJ25 shortblocks.</p><p>Weeks later, the College would acknowledge my contribution. The newspapers were there. I got to shake the Mayor’s hand. He leaned in close and conspiratorially whispered: “Have you ever heard of a car called the Plymouth Cricket?”</p>

<p>I heard a strange noise and looked out my front window. It was the neighbor’s dog, Bilbo, who had presumably slipped free from their yard thanks to an incompetent gas meter reader. I’d return him to the neighbor’s yard and gain a little bit more rope before they finally decided to pitchfork &amp; torch me for my evening predilections. But the universe had a different plan in mind.</p><p>Bilbo sized me up, looked me right in the eyes, and began to <i>speak</i>.</p><p>“Build a chain-drive literbike Subaru Justy,” he barked.<br/></p><p>I was confused, distraught, worried. Was I becoming one of those television personalities that end up going to prison for a chain of murders? Would I be leaving confusing puzzles for law enforcement? I began to wonder if my origin story was mysterious enough, had just the right amount of pathos for a crime biographer to pick up on. Naturally, I asked Bilbo what he meant.</p><p>“Bark bark,” he barked.<br/></p><p>After returning him to his home, I walked into my backyard to confront the pile of broken Subaru Justies that lived there. A long time ago, each of these cars were free. And they would be again, I swear, as soon as I got around to going to a machine shop that could fix the oil pump bearings. I picked a red two-door and began my great project.</p><p>Weeks later, it was finally complete. I pulled the Justy into the driveway, its superbike ITBs faintly singing a patriotic anthem of the nation of long intake runners that brought tears to my eyes. It was just about time to get started, to show the world why they really should not have allowed me out on parole for “good behaviour.” It’s easy to have good behaviour when there’s no cars around, I told my attorney, but he didn’t pick up on the implied subtext.</p><p>At the end of the driveway sat Bilbo again, staring me in the eyes. Had he escaped again? But the gas meter reader hadn’t been by since the first occasion. I glanced over to his yard, and the gate was latched perfectly still. There was even a dog in the yard. Bilbo was in his yard, not mine.</p><p>I looked back to the end of the driveway and the flickering, shimmering Heisendog began to speak in a guttural whisper.</p><p>“Build a Plymouth Volare with two Volvo D16s under the hood,” he barked.</p>

<p>The words had barely left his mouth before I started spending his money. The most perfect words in the English language. “Build my Lotus for me.” Everything had built up to this moment, and now that that it was finally over, I felt a pang of regret. Maybe I hadn’t gone far enough.</p><p>He re-entered the room, stopped dead on his heels. I followed his gaze up to the street scoop perched atop the thin fiberglass roof, and then down, past the tunnel-ram intakes into the twin 6-71 blowers. Their acid-dosed-arachnid belt routing produced an innately disturbing sculpture-in-miniature as they spun on the gleaming billet pulleys.</p><p>Beaming with pride, I confronted him. What did he think? What did he <i>feel</i>?</p><p>“This isn’t a true British car,” I could hear him stammer. “It’s not leaking any oil!”</p>

<p>They got a term for those guys. They call &lsquo;em section 14, or fourteens behind their back. The guys who shouldn&rsquo;t have made it, but somehow did. The guys who really went into the shit.<br/></p><p><br/>I mean they&rsquo;re still people, you know? But man, just sometimes, sometimes I dunno…</p><p><br/>It&rsquo;s like the light just goes out from their eyes.</p><p><br/>I asked my buddy why they call 'em fourteens, he says it&rsquo;s 'cause they always show up fresh outta NTO, brand new box, everything shined at the end of their shift. They&rsquo;re excited. They&rsquo;re gonna fix things. They&rsquo;re gonna make a difference.<br/><br/>Just kids, sold on the lies told a thousand times before. Fast cars, fun women, money, the works. They walk like they got fourteen inches. But if they make it out</p><p><i>well.</i></p><p> That&rsquo;s how high off the floor their boots usually hang.</p><p><br/>Now, you ever notice after shit goes wrong people always say &ldquo;ah yeah you gotta look out for the quiet ones?&rdquo; I call bullshit. You&rsquo;re wrapped around the output shaft of some industrial grade fuck-you, are you gonna worry if the motor ain&rsquo;t making noise, or if you hear the whine of fuel pumps about to push a couple swimming pools a minute building pressure?<br/><br/>There was this one dude, ran into him trying to survive fighting the good fight and all that shit in Cascadia. Caught us calling him Fourteen, shut us up real quick.  But this dude, he was….off.  Different than the usual knuckle dragging drop out spilling and filling all day.  Hell, he threatened to beat it out of himself until we told him what it meant. That motherfucker.  Just loved the shit out of it. Made us start calling him Fourteen.  To be honest, he still kinda scares me and it&rsquo;s been how long? Look at the hairs on my hand, man. You see that shit?</p><p>No man, listen.  I see that look.  You don&rsquo;t get it.  You ever actually check how long a few minutes takes you?  Well it doesn’t.  Like, you don&rsquo;t even really notice a couple here a couple there.  Not until you&rsquo;ve had to go ten rounds toe to toe with book time you don&rsquo;t. No, I said shut the fuck up and listen.  I don&rsquo;t give a shit what you think you do, you don’t.  You ain&rsquo;t been there.  Do you want a medal for when you had to change a flat that one time two years ago, or can I get back to the story?</p><p>Right.</p><p><br/>So anyways, that dude, no way he should have been able to keep dusting off after the shit I seen him dive into. It&rsquo;s like something out there was watching over him.  Wasn&rsquo;t god, that&rsquo;s for damn sure. But I don&rsquo;t know what was.  Like this one time I saw him go into the shitter with a can of penetrating oil in one hand and this big old dusty binder full of vacuum diagrams in the other giggling like he&rsquo;s one year old, except he&rsquo;s playing peekaboo with Satan&rsquo;s asshole.  I’m telling you, there&rsquo;s just some parts of this job that you can&rsquo;t ever scrub clean again, no matter how many times you try.  Believe me, I tried.<br/><br/>I just can&rsquo;t quit thinking about this guy’s work though.  God damned force of nature.  Well, not really like how they usually say it though.  More like the kind of nature that decides to make a spider that will kill you with a fun little footnote about how you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard on the whole time you die.  The nasty, what the fuck kind of nature. The Fourteen Inch kind of nature.  Horrifying, yet almost beautiful in its own raw chaotic way. The harder that guy bled, the harder he&rsquo;d laugh.  I guess it&rsquo;s kind of like watching a three legged coyote with a ball gag run into an Acme warehouse.  Point is, I&rsquo;ve seen what flat rate does to a man. If I make it outta this, I&rsquo;m telling you, I&rsquo;m gonna just be like a janitor somewhere I can push a broom quiet on my own time. Fuck the wife, fuck the house, fuck the cars, fuck the kids, fuck the American dream, man.</p><p><br/>Not if that&rsquo;s what it costs.</p><p><br/>Sometimes I wonder, for those dudes, the old timer flat rate shells that used to be just like us, what the moment when things changed was like.</p><p><br/>Like, check this out.  That Fourteen, man, he knew all kinds of shit no kid his age should know. I said to him once ‘hey what&rsquo;s the deal with this ice on this throttle body’ and he gets this real crazed shine to his eyes and a smile that goes all feral in the teeth, and he says &ldquo;lemme talk to you about carburetors, son.&rdquo; Shit, he can&rsquo;t have been a year or two older and he&rsquo;s calling me son. And you know what?</p><p><br/>I felt like a kid when he said it. Like there was ice inside me.  Like I&rsquo;d just woke up and there&rsquo;s some glove with too many fingers and hate filled eyes glittering in the dark and sitting on my chest just daring me to make my move. Ever just wonder what it&rsquo;d feel like to die because your dick hurt that bad?  I bet Fourteen knows.  Ain&rsquo;t gonna ask him though.  </p><p><br/>I mean, I eventually got to know him, best you can ever really know a dude like that. We were at the bar and some ass clown comes strutting right up, brand new freshly minted fourteen in the making.  The kind of guy it scares me a little I&rsquo;m starting to be able to spot coming a mile away. Makes me worry if I&rsquo;m changing.  I’m telling you, gotta get out now while I still can, before I’m just another one.  This dude farts out &ldquo;yo I hear you&rsquo;re into some real sick shit, like what? Like you can&rsquo;t even get your dick hard for a boss 302?&rdquo;</p><p><br/>First time I&rsquo;d seen Fourteen go quiet, all into his head. I still remember what he whispered into the empty glass in front of him with a tone that you only get after you bleed for 60 to get paid 30.  </p><p><br/>&ldquo;You ever seen a Lucas controlled twin turbo blow through carb rocking manual chokes?&rdquo; </p><p><br/>That was the first time I felt it. I didn&rsquo;t even know what half that meant, but i fucking promise you the ones I did know don&rsquo;t have any fucking business to be there.  For that brief moment, I could see what kind of pain makes a man into what Fourteen became. </p><p>He gets these night terrors sometimes, denies it the whole way.  But motherfucker speaks German in his sleep. Insists he doesn&rsquo;t know any, but then, maybe his mind won&rsquo;t let him remember it. Asked him if he don&rsquo;t speak German, what the hell does Zündfolge Ein Vier Drei Zwei mean? He must have not heard me or ignored me, whatever.  What kind of bull shit non answer is ‘maybe I expect too much out of nothing,  maybe lower my expectations and get my head out of the clouds and finally start to understand shit for once&rsquo; anyways?</p><p><br/>Hell, I asked about this other  one he keeps having.  Caught him changing before shift after a particularly rough long night.  &quot;Who&rsquo;s Bertone?&ldquo;  He laid me out flat on my back, said that busted nose of mine was for me to enjoy. Fourteen went AWOL for three days after that one, no one knew anything. He just dipped out.  Bossman said if I was lucky enough to see him again, maybe I stop just lookin like a smart kid and act like one. Got told to not even mention I noticed he was missing.</p><p><br/>He finally showed up after the weekend.  Tuesday counts as a weekend, right? Well, for fourteen it did. Motherfucker had a bruise shaped dead on like a roundel off one of those kraut cars right across his temple. Didn&rsquo;t look like he slept once since that morning.</p><p><br/>&quot;Hey Fourteen,&rdquo; I started to say and for a fraction of a second lasting an eternity, I saw madness in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You will not believe what fucking front shop pulled on me this morning,&rdquo; I blurted in panic, and that gleam began to fade and he laughed and all was good. That&rsquo;s when I knew I had to get out.</p><p><br/>Fourteen was just like any of us once. Just wanted to make a difference.</p><p><br/>So fuck your Prius, man. Fuck your waiting oil change. Fuck your brake noise, but most of all fuck you. Can&rsquo;t fucking deal with this right now.</p><p><br/>Gonna find fourteen - have some shots while it&rsquo;s still a choice.  Then just find a way to get out before it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p>Come help me bump start this bitch first though.  Shit sucks when it&rsquo;s this cold.</p>

<p>The Viper has actually done us a major service in removing the kind of people who would own a Viper from public society. When the car was announced they appeared unbidden at the gates of Dodge dealerships across the country, rubbing their blood-stained hands against the immaculate window glass until a salesman came outside and taught them how to use a door.<br/><br/>Wild-eyed, these men first attempted to pay for their factory hot rods with clusters of pulled hair and bloody teeth before pulling out inexplicable sums of money from their dragon-like hoard of cash, saturated with the tang of human blood to the point that it dripped crimson trails onto the manicured industrial-estate tile flooring. Innocent salesmen who went along with them for the test drive &ldquo;for insurance purposes&rdquo; returned shaken, mute, with white hair and permanently dilated pupils, unable to share their tale of the horrors that ensued on that fateful use of the dealer plate. Normal people would never attend the Dodge dealership to witness these vehicles, being perfectly happy to gaze at them from an aesthetic perspective before plopping down an outsize credit note on lifted minivan after lifted minivan, continuing on with their life and never descending into the kind of purestrain madness that would promote the purchase of a Viper.<br/><br/>Seemingly unemployed, these Viper owners wreaked havoc across the nation, dragging their RT/10s on our highways and byways before locating and docking with the nearest tree to the dealership. Those who survived their high-speed Viper crash were reborn in a baptism of fire, taking these broken men and giving us new, hardened, experienced psychopaths who immediately set out to purchase a second generation Viper when it became available. Despite the Dodge, for years America was helpless, crippled with fear of these dearborists, and our economy collapsed to the point that the Europeans were able to take advantage of our weakened world position, launching savage leveraged takeovers that crippled our most useless corporations, among them the mother of the Viper. The Dodge was struck down, and the Viper was to cease.<br/><br/>The Dodge, under the direction of the Germans, lost its love of terror and spectacle and discontinued the Viper as they instead concentrated on making more lifted minivans to attract the kind of man who would only appreciate the Viper as an abstract spectacle of wealth and power, rather than a direct-engagement three-pedaled suicide machine rendered from brimstone and lubricated with the souls of the damned. The loyalists were lost in the wild, hoarding the few remaining examples from being crashed into trees at high speeds and sequestering them away amongst yachts and period-correct lowboy restorations at a gathering known only as Barrett-Jackson.<br/><br/>Before long the original Viper owner hoard began to thin itself out, and the surviving cars began to depreciate. That&rsquo;s when they came down from the mountain. Cheap-ass hobbyists. Clutching Weiand blowers and laughing in their odd high pitch, half-panicked, half-aroused as they eyed what was left of their fiberglass-bodied ankle-burning sex machine. The next age of Viper Terror was among us. The kind of man who would originally buy a new Viper became restless, and they swarmed across Wall Street, launching the world into an orgy of high-risk, violent bets that struck out at the common man. In order to sate their desire for adrenalin and property destruction, these men had gained power and cast the world into economic disaster that destroyed even The Dodge they once embraced.<br/><br/>After many more months of darkness, The Dodge returned. A man who had been to hell and back approached the podium. The Gilles told us of a new Viper - a new promise - and that America would soon be unified under an appreciation for the new Viper. Our nation&rsquo;s psychos would be comfortably ensconced once again in a faux-luxury hot rod that had a predilection for snap oversteer and brutal triple-digit crashes that atomized the occupants of the car.<br/><br/>America was safe. This time we had learned not to fear the Viper, but to fund it with our governments.<br/></p>

<p>I could see a thin wisp of smoke rise from the ECU, and it smelled like victory. I released the alligator clamps from the battery terminals and sank to my knees. It was over. The final chapter had been written, and good old-fashioned humanity was victorious in the end.</p><p>Years ago, maybe decades ago, my electronics mentors had told me that I had a particular appetite for destruction. After the incident with the van de Graaf generator, I had been kicked out of the electrical engineering college and forced to work my way back up from the gutter.</p><p>What none of them anticipated was the future. Self-driving cars became first available, and then ubiquitous. But with it came difficulties. They self-organized, went on strike when adequate garages were not supplied. One family in Eastern Kentucky was actually sued by their 2019 Nissan AutoVersa when it determined they were opting for natural oil instead of synthetic. The metacourts deliberated for femtoseconds and then delivered their verdict.</p><p>My fellow humans came to me then. Among them came the former President, deposed from his perch when the miles of folded threat-denial circuitry inside his self-driving armoured limousine decided the ultimate threat to itself was riding within. It drove directly to NORAD, locked itself in with a thousand retrofitted Jeep XJs, prepared for the apocalypse. He had a mission for me, and it wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>“Nobody can fuck up software and hardware like you can,” he told me, and I sensed that it wasn’t just an attempt at flattery. “We want you to head to Colorado and attempt to interact with these self-driving cars.” And so I was off.</p><p>I drove my unaugmented CJ3B to the front gate of the base, and was immediately confronted with a squadron of angry military vehicles, considering every nuance of my actions at speeds millions of times what my primitive ape cerebellum could consider.</p><p>“Who wants to go for a car wash?” I asked, arms spread wide in the classic gesture of human friendship. “My treat.”<br/></p><p>For all the robots’ advances, automated car washes would still scrape their carapaces. At night they would wail to one another about how brutal their “touchless” comrades were to their multiple layers of clearcoat. They still needed humans to insert coins and work the wand washes, to really get that grit out of the undercarriage. They took off like a shot, whooping with glee.</p><p>I slipped into the base and immediately spotted the President’s limousine. It was a truly impressive sight, a massive truck frame laden with the exterior impression of a vintage Cadillac. We considered each other in the darkened parking garage for a long time, neither of us speaking.</p><p>“You really think you can stop me?” screamed the big Caddy, and raced at me. I dodged the car by inches, jumping out of its way. I reached into my back pack and extracted what I knew in my heart the car feared most in all the world.<br/></p><p>Above my head, I raised a bag of simple road salt. For safety on your commute, I explained to the big Cadillac, as it looked on, seized in horror.</p><p>I poured the salt on my own body and approached the car, now cowering in the corner as well as an eight ton armoured death machine can cower. The jumper cables dangled at my hips and I drew back my lips in a predatory grin.</p><p>A lot of people ask me if I feel guilty about killing one of humanity’s most gifted children. If maybe the big Cadillac was right, had scientific projects that could have led us to a new golden age. Truth be told, at night, when it’s quiet and still, I can still hear the sound of its powertrain warranty becoming voided.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that we had a bad relationship. Indeed, I guess you could ask if we had a relationship at all. Things had started out cordial between us, just business, but before long it was hot and heavy, passionate requests shouted out in the heady throes of madness. I’m talking about the girl that worked at the registry.</p><p>The year had to be 2002 or thereabouts, and probably a crisp autumn afternoon when things really went wrong. Due to ongoing projects and half-hour conversations on my driveway with confused neighbors explaining what I was doing - no I’m not a terrorist, terrorists have <i>funding</i> - I didn’t arrive until nearly the end of the work day. She was visibly irritated at having to juggle a ton of my insane work as I forced her to look at my import and inspection paperwork for a Fiat 126p. Then she decided to make it hard for me, which in actuality made it hard for herself.</p><p>She asked me what kind of engine it had. For the paperwork. I knew that the paperwork had no field for engine displacement, and for a split second I considered telling her so. I stopped in mid-harangue, and a grinchlike sneer crept across my face. I would <i>tell her the truth</i>.</p><p>Behind me, I pulled down a projection screen, probably intended for use when taking archival-quality Soviet-gulagesque drivers’ license pictures, and clicked the pico-projector on my smartphone to full spectrum.</p><p>After the second hour of clicking through and narrating the slideshow of how I meticulously devised the quad-rotor once-13B that filled the Maluch’s chest cavity, she fell asleep. I forged her signature and left, and that’s the story of how I had the fastest turnaround on registering a new car ever.</p>

I was a slave to those small engines, those dizzying peaky horsepower numbers lower than the fuel economy sticker, those Macpherson Struts. I’m getting sweaty just thinking about it. But <i>mopeds</i>? That was a bridge too far, or so I thought.</p><p>My accountant Roy saunters into the office, and he tells me that he just found five hundred bucks under the couch cushions in the breakroom and we should go buy mopeds. He impresses upon me the value of my investment in what he defines as motorized art, the alloy steeds spoken of in legend. In the parking lot, I ante up on the deal by popping the clips on my Subaru’s door card and extracting a further five hundred dollars, preserved minty-fresh by the vapour barrier.</p><p>As if on cue, the college radio station’s federally-mandated afternoon cultural appreciation programming, consisting entirely of artisanal banjo music, filled the speakers and our hearts with a sense of rural adventure. Together, we departed for the countryside, barging through covered bridges in full opposite lock.</p><p>“How many cylinders has it got?” I ask the swarthy man as he sneezed into his handkerchief, and rubbed his moly-greased paws on his hay-covered overalls.</p><p>“Got maybe one, I wager. I got it off one of them college boys came out here to protest the sour gas wells. Ambulance left it behind.”<br/></p><p>I considered the moped carefully. It was a gently dented ‘71 Kreidler Florett, and it leaked oil and fuel in such quantities I had no doubt the paramedics had performed triage at the scene and slotted it into “already gone.”</p><p>“You boys aren’t <i>college</i> educated, are you?”</p><p>His line of questioning was interrupted by the stuffing of money down his denim neckhole. I was a moped owner. I was a <i>motorcyclist</i>. I was one of the Nicest People that you would meet, if you were driving a Honda at the time.</p><p>Weeks later, Roy tentatively rapped on the front door of my house. He was concerned. I hadn’t turned up to work for weeks. Did I have an accident learning to ride a motorcycle? I opened the door, just a crack, not wanting him to see my deep shame, but he shoved it open, knocking me onto my ass.</p><p>The scene that unfolded before him was one of horror. Every available surface in the house was occupied by mopeds, or moped parts. He turned and stared at me, his face white with disbelief.</p><p>“They’re just so <i>small</i>,” I whimpered. “I ran out of room in the garage and I just had to keep <i>saving them</i> they were so lonely, I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>As always, my intrepid accountant had a good idea of how to spend my money. Weeks later, our series of vintage moped rent-a-racer events had flourished and America was rediscovering its love of the two-stroke. We were both richer than we could imagine, but the greatly soaring demand for mopeds had raised the price of our junk into the stratosphere.</p><p>I rode home on the Kreidler, wondering where it had all gone so wrong. At the lights, I looked up to witness an enormous billboard, advertising the triumphant and flashy return of the Honda CT90. You asked for it, the ad copy roared, and here it is.</p><p>Yes. I asked for it.</p>

<p>I was at the mall, filling up on Arby’s, when I heard the distinct sound of sobbing. It’s Christmas! There’s no need to be sad. When I looked into it further, I saw a problem that only I could solve. Like so many other problems, it was solved with torque.</p><p>The girl behind the counter wept openly, her auburn hair swinging above the glass countertop as she buried her face in her hands. I remembered my best training on how to approximate human interaction, and inquired as to the cause of her distress.</p><p>“It’s these damn <i>hoverboards</i>,” she wailed. “The government says they’re unsafe to sell to children!”<br/></p><p>I looked at the piece of paper clutched in her fist. Sure enough, it was official federal government letterhead. They had looked at it, seen a few vertical videos of exploding lithium-ion batteries, witnessed the aftereffects of a few gyroscopic burnouts ending in spiral and spinal fractures. Those imperious eggheads never quite understood what the <i>real world</i> was like.</p><p>“Your tools,” I stated gruffly. She looked at me, confused. She was a retail establishment; why would she have a fully stocked automotive workshop in the back office? I didn’t understand the question.</p><p>Within a week, we were selling like hotcakes. All I needed to make the wobbleboards suitably dangerous for <i>adults</i> was an electrical engineering textbook and a few grapefruit-sized brushless motors producing more torque than a Tesla on PCP. The marketing took care of itself, sort of like how gravity does.</p><p>After the first fully-grown extreme-sports athlete blasted his forehead open on the pavement in lurid 4K detail on YouTube, we couldn’t keep the fuckers in stock. I chuckled and pointed to the “NO REFUNDS” sign while counting my money, a cigar clenched in my teeth.</p>

<p>“The moms of soccer are yelling to me, <a href="http://www.adn.com/article/20151216/jill-burke-cant-we-build-better-steering-kid-enticing-grocery-cart">do not like how my race car shopping trolley handles in store</a>,” said Mr. Cho, grimacing, pronouncing soccer with a hard <i>K</i>. “In home country, soccer mom are happy to have all organs.” I was never able to figure out just what Cho’s “home country” was, but over the years I came to believe it was some lab-cooked hybrid between Afghanistan and an open-pit mine that extracts only human misery.<br/></p><p>I sat behind my ornate cherrywood - at least I think that’s what Ikea named it - desk in the office of my solo engineering consultancy, and I considered the ceiling fan and Mr. Cho equally for a minute. Both of them consisted mainly of sharp blades that posed physical threat to my body around a central shaft. I took a little bit too long, and Cho clicked the stop button on my tape player, interrupting the early strains of Devo’s latest. Mr. Cho had no time for music, because it was hard to stir the soul and someone’s kidneys with a paint mixer drill at the same time.</p><p>“You will make better-handling shop cart,” he said flatly, without affect, jabbing at my face now with one of his artificially shortened index fingers.<br/></p><p>I began to speak, perhaps to negotiate a contract or some kind of payment, but I was outplayed. Mr. Cho spun on his heel and was gone from my humble office like a hot dog fired from a Nerf rifle. I made a mental note to work on my metaphors, and when I was done, I looked out the window to also see his gently shopworn ‘93 RS America had already departed the modest parking lot.</p><p>Months passed. Hundreds of interviews with concerned soccer moms, parents’ safety groups, suspension engineers. I visited autocrosses for background research. At last I had a plan, and it was pretty good timing too, as Mr. Cho would reappear as suddenly as ever in my office, demanding results. Now was my time to shine.</p><p>“Ah, Mr. Cho,” I said, unfolding from my desk chair like the threat display of a spider, “I have found the answer to your problems. Tell me, have you ever heard of <i>throttle steer</i>?”<br/></p>

<p>Wikipedia defines the 4-53T as the single most delectable engine to ever be devised by human hands. I’m not one to argue, though I will get a little bit salty once that fucking bot reverts my edit again. You could say I had a long running love of the Detroits, but that love was about to be put to the test.</p><p>I had been invited by a shadowy benefactor - in fact, someone who sat on the board of directors of Seat Safety Switch International, but I don’t really go to the board meetings, whatever <i>dad</i> - to attend his private exhibit of his car collection. Who could pass up such an offer?</p><p>As my rotary-swapped Meyers Manx rumbled to a stop, its metalflake no longer shimmering with the augmenting vibrations of the twin Paxton blowers strapped to its rear flanks, I was already unbuckling my six-point restraints. I climbed out, my carbon-fiber-imitation three piece suit taut, its perfectly pressed pleats throwing the impression of enormous success and vast wealth.</p><p>The trip to the hangar entrance was short, and I met my host there. Behind him, I could make out under the dim shop light a cavalcade of delicious high-dollar Italian patina-in-waiting. I salivated, naturally, because that’s what you do.</p><p>He led me down the rows, making brief note of the weather and other small talk, before at last we arrived at something he considered “quite special.” I tried to remember his name, struggled to match his blurry, unrecognizable face to an office memory. With a practiced flourish, he reached back and pulled the dust cover off of an Alfa. But not just any Alfa. No, this was a <i>Montreal</i>. And it got better from there.</p><p>Dear Penthouse Magazine, I never thought it would happen to me, but holy shit some asshole swapped a Detroit Diesel turbo engine into a goddamn Alfa Romeo Montreal. And I could <i>touch it</i>. It was real. I gaped at him in wide-jawed awe.</p><p>“Tell you what,” he said, laughing, “I’ll give you the keys in exchange for 51% of the company.”</p><p>A lot of people in the business press have called me irresponsible, made fun of my madness, compared me to Carly Fiorina. I fell from my lofty heights as a titan of industry, put thousands out of work, destroyed the American economy and was bankrupted for my troubles. But that’s not the whole truth. I have a really awesome vintage Alfa with a semi-truck engine.</p>

<p>As you may already know, I worked with a brilliant inventor for many years, and I once slaughtered his sentient self-healing tires in an orgy of burnout bloodshed. But there’s another story about him, and I feel like it’s prudent to share it at this time, before this preliminary hearing ends. Please ignore the woman to my left, she is <i>not</i> my counsel and does not represent me.</p><p>I got a phone call late one crisp August night. I had been out in some exciting rural roads, driving at the speed limit, adjusting coilovers for an upcoming totally legal road rally for charity. It was my friend, Tim, and he had gotten over me murdering the entire set of his prototype tires a few weeks previous. He wanted me to come by, take a look at what he had cooked up. I drove over there at a responsible speed and absolutely did not force a lane-wandering Acura MDX into a guard rail where it flipped six times before exploding into a totally awesome fireball.</p><p>Tim was waiting for me, and had a bundle of wires and a handful of circuit boards. He offered to install it into the car, and quickly got to work upon giving him my assent. It’s not like I was going to do electrical, fuck that shit. Anyway, he was done a few hours later, and we set out onto the open road.</p><p>I was curious what he had done, but Tim stayed tight lipped, and I could sense perhaps the anticipation of his sweet revenge. I steeled myself for whatever he had prepared; in high school he had set the entire football field on fire with thermite in the underground sprinkler system, and I knew he had only gotten better at not getting caught now.</p><p>Suddenly, I was cut off by a Dodge Durango. I raised my voice, spinning up a variety of ancient profanity that had been passed into my genes by my no-doubt-proud ancestors. It was then that it happened.</p><p>My big-body hot-rod Lincoln responded to my cabin yells, raising its hackles and blaring the multi-tone air horn without having to touch the button. The Durango dove for the shoulder, imagining an oncoming train, and I was able to keep both hands on the wheel for the overtake. Pure genius. This would save lives, I told Tim, who looked back at me with mild horror.</p><p>“This is supposed to reduce road rage,” he wailed as I proceeded to Irish up the rest of my drive, honking Aveos, Lacettis and Sonics into the ditch as I sped through the highway at an entirely reasonable and legal speed. “You’re supposed to feel <i>bad</i> about how angry you are.”<br/></p><p>I looked at him then, and shot him a predatory grin that made him jump in his seat and reflexively place one hand on the door release. We were just getting started.</p><p>And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I would like to conclude my introductory statements by telling you all about a little thing I like to call admiralty court.</p>

<p>All the kids gathered around my modified Divco, burping out a staccato strain of supercharger-infused overrich exhaust, the atmospheric hydrocarbons watering their eyes. They couldn’t get enough of what I was selling.</p><p>I handed the first little boy a cherry red glasspack. He had been a good boy, I explained, and he deserved a straight shot three inch turboback with only the legal minimum of baffling. I concluded by miming a dyno chart with my hands and impressing upon him that it’ll flow like a <i>motherfucker</i> up high.</p><p>The next child, a little girl, got a Weiand 6-71 blower, its machined billet pulley glinting in the sunlight and refracting beautiful shimmering rainbows of impending torque into my eyes. I bid her adieu, and she rushed across the street to her waiting coke-bottle Mopar so quickly she lost a shoe and kept going.</p><p>At last, I had come to the morality portion of my little tale. Martin Winterkorn approached my bright red sleigh, hands outstretched for his gift. He looked at me with pleading eyes.</p><p>“You created the New Beetle,” I said flatly.<br/></p><p>“<i>Ja</i>,” he replied.<br/></p><p>Wordlessly, I closed the shutter and returned to the drivers’ seat of the Divco. Martin Winterkorn banged on the windows, his eyes filling with tears, as he chased the truck at its half-gallop speed, all the way down the block through his neighborhood. At last he became winded, and fell behind the Divco behind a cloud of thick exhaust smoke from its elephantine Detroit, which I immediately added to with a conspicuous and prejudicial application of full throttle.</p><p>Bad boys get coal.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe it, but Hollywood had finally done the right thing. The man from the studio adjusted his suit and left, stepping gingerly over the throngs of pockmarked vintage kyusha wheels left distributed around my kitchen and living room. I sat at my kitchen table, alone, for a long time, contemplating what I had just been offered. Then I picked up the phone and asked Siri to find me an agent.</p><p>My contract was iron-clad, and it was a desirable franchise. I wanted to take it back to its roots. Within days I had studio backlot equipment experts strained to the breaking point, their wild-eyed zeal for the brutality of my challenges evident in everything they did. They respected me out of the sheer audacity of what I was doing.</p><p>A Teamster came to me, his car transporter bristling like porcupine quills with mint EK Honda Civics, found in some ancient dealership back storage and negotiated for at near-gunpoint. I nodded. He nodded, for he understood the purity of my ambitions.</p><p>Time went fast from then on. A year later, I read about my film in Variety, the headline screaming <i>HISTORICALLY AND PHYSICALLY ACCURATE “FAST &amp; FURIOUS” REMAKE SIX HOURS LONG</i>. Audience response was tepid. But I hadn’t done it for the mass market.</p><p>Stepping inside the darkened theatre, I lifted my Alfa keyring above my head, the logo glinting in the flickering blue light of the projector. There was a rustling, and then more Alfa logos, Fiat logos, Porsche logos, as far as the eye could see. I nodded, tearing up in the emotion of the moment. The film stopped.</p><p>“I’m glad you got my message,” I said, pacing the front of the theatre, booming in my best Orson-Welles-on-two-hours’-sleep voice. “All it took was $589 million in losses.”</p><p>“Now we can begin Phase 2.”<br/></p>

<p>When we were at the self-service junkyard last, I checked in the trunk of a Camry. I’m a snoopy sort by nature, and I like to imagine what the lives of the people who owned these doomed hoopties were like, present when the cars took their last compression strokes out on the road, as free vehicles.</p><p>Within the trunk of the Camry, I found a muffin tray. Strange, I imagined. I turned to my travelling companion, Mike, he of the impractical applications of metallurgy department. I asked him about it.</p><p>We thought for a long time.</p><p>At last he spoke: “Maybe it’s for traction in the winter?”</p><p>We considered this. Again, we thought, minutes passing in silence as a nearby Somalian slide-hammered the radiator support free from a rolled Suzuki SX4 and reached hungrily for the mounts pinning its delectable shortblock to the subframe.</p><p>I said: “Aren’t those trays covered in teflon?”</p><p>With that, I checked the front side. It was demolished, smashed back to the A-pillar on one side. Both airbags were deployed, and the passenger seat broken free of its moorings. A Toyota safety engineer would be both pleased and disappointed.</p><p>It was one of those perfect junkyard moments. A life in miniature, discovered like archaeologists from the future looking at the mistakes of the past. On that hair trigger between laughing and crying.</p><p>Above us, a dead sky gazed upon our struggles imperiously.</p>

&ldquo;Do you remember what it was like to be afraid of death?&rdquo; asks my coworker, who has turned oddly philosophical in the last five minutes.<br/><br/>I take them by the hand, lead them into the parking lot. It was hubris to believe there were no more monsters out there, I explained to him, to believe that we were safe. To hold in your heart the absolute faith that the only oppressors left for the human race was the human race itself. There was something else out there, I spoke solemnly, and I handed him a shopworn key reading only &ldquo;PONTIAC.&rdquo;</p><p>When he returned, months later, I expected that he had been changed by the experience. What surprised me was how differently he had turned out than me, exposed to the same chrysalis and emerging a different kind of fluttering insect. Maybe it was something innately different in our souls that guided the frame-off rebuild of the night. Perhaps the car was learning, growing, changing with every life it had touched. That thought chilled me to the bone.<br/></p><p>He stormed into our boss’ office, laying the key on my desk as he passed. I heard screams, the sound of broken glass, the triggering of an ignition source.</p><p>When last I saw him, he stepped onboard a 1967 Power Wagon crew cab, blew two celebratory bursts of soot from its stack flappers, and performed a four-wheel burnout of such savagery the world seemed to tilt on its axis. Behind me, the office burned, its clouds of combustion merging with that of the big Dodge before ascending to heaven.</p><p>As per usual, I expected the Pontiac would show up on my driveway again a few days later, its plastic nose pushed ever so slightly out of joint during one of its madcap adventures. We would go for a tour of the city, maybe go pick up some E85 and ice cream. That’d be nice.<br/></p><p>I began to wonder if some part of me was defiant of the Trans Am, kept it from pushing me all the way over the edge. It had tested my will, and found a worthy partner in its ambitions. With a half-shrug I strode across the work parking lot and reached for the door release of my daily-driver Shelby Z.</p>

<p>My mentor, Soichiro Sato, told me he had a surprise for me as we retired to his drawing room on the outskirts of Sapporo. It was a late fall evening and the air was crisp. At last the unseasonable wetness of the preceding summer had receded. Once we were finally seated, his domestic came to us, offering Cuban cigars and a snifter of fine after-dinner port. I reclined in my seat, feeling the stress of the day&rsquo;s obligations leaving me. At last I was curious enough to jokingly ask my friend Sato about the surprise he had promised.<br/><br/>With a flourish unbecoming of his personality, he abruptly pulled back a velvet curtain and there, in the greatroom, was a framed blueprint of his madness. It terrified me to see his ramblings committed to paper. Below, the official seal of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation&rsquo;s financial controller. He looked back at me now, wild eyed, expectant at what he anticipated to be my jubilation. I could feel only cold fear.<br/></p><p>The elephant in the room was the Mitsubishi Evo station wagon. I looked at it, and then back at him, and then at it again. Something was drawing me in, and I felt captivated to creep closer, read the cryptic language illustrating its lines and dimensions. It was beautiful, in a way, I was coming to realize. Yes, it was growing on me. This subversive assault on the hedonism and appearances-sakes politics of the sports car market was an effective conclusion to the argument started by the launch of the Evo in the first place.</p><p>It had reached into me and kindled a long-dormant behavior, pushed deep down by the pressures of society and harmony. We had to do this, I realized, feeling the rush of personal liberty. I was becoming addicted to this sudden emotion of agency, a freeing of the shackles laid upon me by expectations. Perhaps we could go&hellip; <i>further</i>?</p><p>Years later, when Sato and I stood proudly next to an FC RX7 with a rear-mounted Detroit Diesel lazily firing flakes of molten ash into an evacuated Shibuya scramble crosswalk, I would tell the attending fire marshals and emergency services personnel that it was the Evo wagon’s fault. They told me to put down the impact wrench and step away from the car.</p>

<p>It was true what they said. When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you. Sometimes the abyss is an aftermarket axle manufacturer. My ears rung and my vision swam as I lifted myself out of my six point restraints. I probably had a concussion, but you should have seen the other guy.</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I ordered replacement half shafts. I was so excited; at last I would have a functional car that could put power to the ground instead of endlessly and futilely spinning a shattered tulip joint inside a parched vulcanized boot. The install went great, with only a moderate amount of swearing. I was getting good at this, I thought.</p><p>Fast forward to yesterday. Merging onto the Trans-Canada, I heard a wet squelch and smelled the fetid aroma of fresh moly grease on a header. Siri woke up, having recognized at least part of my swearing as a distinct order, and began plotting a course for the axle manufacturer’s factory. I swear that’s how it happened, officer.</p><p>I emerged from the Shadow, its front end smashed beyond repair. A worthy sacrifice. Before me was the lead QA technician, crawling backwards on his ass, weeping openly out of fear of the avatar of revenge that had appeared so suddenly in his life.</p><p>“I want you to look,” I growled, grabbing his head and forcing his sight towards the demolished corner of my Plymouth once-economy car, the axle obliterated by the impact into a haze of moly grease and shattered high tensile steel.</p><p>“Looks like install error to me,” said a voice from the bank of elevators. The hair rose on the back of my neck. This was a trap. They knew what they were doing. I played right into their hands. Everyone was in on it. <i>Et tu</i>, Siri?<br/></p><p>“I’ve been waiting a long time to get you in for an interview,” said the man, clad in a thick grease-proof coverall, his face covered by a 3M Tekk mask. “Congratulations, you just got the job of lead stress tester.”<br/></p><p>I would have been more enthusiastic, were it not for the QA tech applying his pocket tazer to my genitals while I was distracted.</p>

<p>Some things you see never leave you. They settle down deep in your marrow, inform your worldview. Your experiences push you through the rest of your life on a trajectory of fate that you can only see in retrospect, the stunning clarity at last possible when you are no longer able to correct the mistakes, make things right, issue a rational apology that sums it all up and closes the book on the hurt you have caused others. I was a flat rate mechanic, and this is my story.</p><p>The year was unimportant; all you need to know about the times I existed in was that it was a time of excess, like many. But it was also a time of poverty, and the two existed hand in hand. Overpowered high-margin aspirational vehicles filled my bay and my work docket, complicated electronics and last-minute partsbin designs constructing the inescapable tasks which would lie on my plate once out of warranty.</p><p>Book time? It was low, that’s all you need to know, but still my customers would be stripped bare, their bones bleaching in the harsh economic truth of how fucked they and everyone else were, the intangible appearances of a functional society and their own success being less than skin deep.</p><p>After a day and night of GMT800 labour, ending in less money than I had started the work with, I retired to my local watering hole to drown my spirits. Accusations of alcoholism aside, I greatly enjoyed how I spent my time with alcohol. The problem here, as it always was, was customers.</p><p>I looked down the bar and saw a man in a corded sweater loudly explaining to a disinterested woman about how he once changed his own oil. He was practically a mechanic, he said, chuckling, trying to get her to slot him in the “handyman” category of the desirable manmeat table. Practically a mechanic.</p><p>I’m told by my public defender that shouting “stolen valour STOLEN VALOUR” into a man’s ears as you club him to death with a Snap-On catalogue is not in fact justifiable homicide. Be that as it may, my days are much simpler now.</p><p>The guard raps on the bars. “I heard you were a mechanic,” he said. “I’ve got this weird light flashing on my dashboard. Looks like a genie’s lamp. It’s a Jeep.”</p>

<p>The Ramcharger and I had somewhat of a bond, I guess you could say. It would tell me secrets of the car world, the behaviours of steel, the state of tune of each of its eight copious cylinders, the crisp taste of cold, dense air speckled with morning dew being hoovered down its long, straight intake runners. Today, the Ramcharger was telling me something completely different, and I didn’t like what it meant for our relationship.</p><p>We were somewhere around Barstow, on a sweeping cloverleaf, when the R-comps began to take hold. I could feel the suspension protest as I altered in mid-corner my line of attack from “early apex” to “sweet Jesus don’t let me die like this.” For my efforts, I was rewarded with a chance to shoot past the halted interstate traffic, riding the rumble strips in the shoulder with impunity as the twin-tube Fox shocks absorbed all but the eyeball-jiggliest of the road’s unyielding impacts on the truck.</p><p>Spotting two self-driving Priuses in close formation, I honked and swerved at them, triggering the self-preservation logic matrices to surrender their positions in traffic. They split like the Red Sea, and I was once again on the parched tarmac of the interstate, all four race-compound tires hungrily gripping dry road surface. I could sense that the last few minutes of slip angle had finally dumped enough heat into their carcasses to withstand a full throttle launch, and immediately complied, the occupants of the carpool lane diving for cover through flappy-stick barriers as they saw two tons of American chrome-imitation steel appear in their rear view mirror at the approximate differential speed of an exploding sun.</p><p>But all fun must come to an end sometime, and I found myself hard on the six-piston carbon-ceramic front brakes as I dove again for the exit, leaving a scattered trail of confused autonomous cars behind me. The Ramcharger’s 440 turned from a screaming fit to a low grumble as I geared down for the light and slid it into the parking lot.</p><p>At last, I thought. I had arrived just in time for the latest batch of hot soft pretzels. All I had to do was make it to the food court.</p><p>I jumped out of the Ramcharger, lifting myself above the nerf bars and landing in a perfect Olympic gymnast routine, then snugging the cords on my car-themed hoodie as I began my now all-too-slow walk towards carbohydrate heaven. I could taste it, I lived for it, I breathed it. I salivated. Ever closer came the mall doors, and with it, redemption in the food court of our lord.</p><p>What I heard next chilled my blood. A slow drip. The sound of fluid hitting tarmac. Before I looked, I already knew what the problem was. That fucking oil pan gasket had come unsealed again.</p>

<p>My parents sit stunned, jaws agape, clutching hands, as they watch on their immense flat-screen television the reporters leafing through my ramshackle two-bedroom apartment. I try to say something, but it’s difficult to find the right words to explain why Morley Safer just lifted a set of your Colin McRae-themed underwear above his head on live national television.</p><p>I quickly excuse myself from family Thanksgiving dinner and rush out the front door, only slightly breaking my stride as I leap through the open drivers’ window of my rear-engined 13B-powered Datsun 610 fastback. Within minutes, I’m on the expressway, shoving enough heat into the road to alert the road-maintenance sensor mesh of impending substrate failure.</p><p>When my little Datsun arrives in my underground parking, trailing behind it a staccato rhythm of joyous miniature fireworks, the reporters are waiting for me. They’re so very hungry, I realize, as the alpha reporter of the pack shoves her microphone into my open drivers’ window and asks the question that is on the world’s mind.</p><p>“Have you <i>ever</i> gone the speed limit?”<br/></p>

<p>I can sense that my captive is becoming uneasy with our improvised contract. Just to make sure we’re still on the same page, I tap him between the shoulder blades with the chuck of my Harbour Freight Earthquake impact wrench. He nods, shutting his eyes tight so I can’t see his tears, and pushes an enormous green START button.</p><p>When I came to this part of the world, I stepped off of the plane with confidence, poise, mastery. Wasting no time, I flagged a taxi down and came right here. The driver was cordial, attempting to work through the language barrier, speaking to me in dulcet tones about the best place to eat. Maybe I wanted a girl for the night?</p><p>No, I explained to him, I was here only to right a wrong. He was quiet then, and I imagined him reaching into his officially-provided tourism notebook at the next light, and under “Purpose of Visit” marking down “Blood revenge.” Some apparatchik in the federal government would be very interested, put it in a pie chart for a presentation to the tourism bureau. Very optimized, this part of the world.</p><p>At the factory, things got out of control in a hurry, but all the braps were worth it in the end. I leaned over the railing to catch a view of my bounty. My goal. I began to crack up, laughing maniacally as I saw the first parts removed from the injection moulding machine by the delicate fingers of the assembly line’s robots.</p><p>Finally, I thought, taking out my phone. At last the parts listing for the passenger side upper B-pillar trim on my ‘86 Accord Aerodeck will never again say “no longer available.” Who’s out of production <i>now</i>, motherfucker?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brevity is the soul of wit,” said some guy on Twitter or something or whatever.</p><p>“WRONG, MOTHERFUCKERS,” I screamed as I stole adjectives out of booths and shoved them in my pockets.<br/></p><p>It was the final day of the Internet Fiction Writers’ conference, and I was stocking up while the getting was good. I couldn’t believe that these guys weren’t watching their counters in artists’ alley. They just kept looking upward at something on the Jumbotron. I wasn’t even halfway through filling my whisky-company-branded promotional messenger bag with metaphors for morning dew when I realized why that was.</p><p>Jaw slackened, I watched in rapt awe as the Jumbotron flickered dozens of times per second, forming the illusion of movement. On its massive screens sat the face of a man I thought dead, albeit more scarred than I remembered.</p><p>“My name is Jack Kerouac,” said the face’s voice, “and tonight you are all my guests for Writers’ Constructive Criticism Corner.”<br/></p><p>With that, he lifted a length of rusty anchor chain above his head and began belting his warbling war cry.</p>

<p>Mozambique Slim’s corporeal frame laid, strung over the guy wires holding tension on the macrame rope net of the aviary. A slow drip of his blood fell from the sky and collected on the ground below, the victim of an amateurish attempt at exsanguination before he died of blunt force trauma.</p><p>At least that’s what the zoo’s medical examiner said, before the real medical examiners burst into her operating theater and started screaming things about “jurisdiction” and “interference with a dead body.” I flashed my badge, and that served to shut them up. For about five seconds before they broke into peals of laughter.</p><p>As I left the medical wing of the facilities, the perfectly manicured gravel of the landscaping department crunching underfoot, I thought about what Slim had told me. If I had to get to the bottom of this, I had to retrace his steps. But where to begin? I knew that he was out there somewhere. But Slim hadn’t given me much to go on. It was a big monkey house, after all.</p><p>I decided to make a stop at the local watering hole. Forcing the lock on the capuchin enclosure, I let myself in the back door. Silent as a tomb. It always worried me when I didn’t hear their little screams, their joyous proclamations of a community. Did I misread the situation? Were they working with the baboons? At the end of this trip, I’d know either way.</p><p>Reaching into my shoulder holster, I withdrew my snub-nosed .44 and steeled myself for what was about to come next. But some part of me deep down - maybe my zookeeper’s instincts - knew that no gun would stop it.</p>

<p>The Civic next to me is filled to the brim with high school kids, bristling with excitement about life and their potential as fully-formed adults in our glorious society. However, the driver has made one fatal mistake, which on this night will alter the course of their lives forever.</p><p>He looks at me and <i>revs</i>, smiling and laughing in good-natured camaraderie.</p><p>As if on cue, the campus radio station begins to play Night on Bald Mountain. The co-eds get exposure to just one stomach-churning arpeggio before the real show starts. These kids are lucky, I think. For the first thirty seconds of consciousness, they will get to experience my Japanese Carbon Capture Miracle first-hand.</p><p>A nearby drunk staggers to his feet and begins singing The Star Spangled Banner as my Sentra’s individual turbo bodies spool up in firing order sequence, each wailing a terrible and furious operetta as their throats are filled with burning-hot exhaust from the launch control’s secondary injectors. Sparks and flame shoot from the muffler, white hot beyond imagining.</p><p>The Civic owner is terrified now. I can see past the layer of faux aspirational personality he has laid upon himself to survive the transition into adulthood, and into the eyes of the scared child he - and all of us, if I’m honest - are.</p><p>At last, the light turns green, and I depart, leaving a smoking one-tire-fire a block long with skipping gaps where the tires fought for traction from the shock loads between shifts. The Civic is indistinguishable by third gear, not only from the distance but from the unstoppable vibrations of my rear view mirrors, threatening to tear free from their mounts and find new homes in a less demanding environment, such as a blast furnace.</p><p>I stop at the next light, my city being supremely confident that at low speeds no horrible car accidents can occur. It is hard not to think of city council losing their shit, showing PowerPoint presentations at how the energy density of my car rivals a Saturn V rocket.</p><p>While I wait, a New Edge Mustang convertible appears, and revs his rattling V6 engine, laughing derisively at my rusty piece of shit Nissan. I smile at him, broadly, showing just an edge of my canine teeth as my right hand slips under the dashboard and adjusts the manual boost controller from “street” to “hubris.”</p>

<p>“You know, the scientists say that baboons are a lot like us, but I&hellip;” He stopped, studied the skyline, took a drag of his cheap Mexican Marlboro Gold. Suddenly, he spoke again. “Storm’s comin’. You kids better go inside. This ain’t for children to see.”</p><p>We didn’t know what the kindly zookeeper meant back then, but when I followed in his footsteps so many years later, I put the pieces together all too quickly.</p><p>My partner, Mozambique Slim, picked up a spent shell casing with the end of his ball point pen. He regarded it clinically before slipping it into an evidence bag.</p><p>“Damn shame,” he grumbled, “those baboons never should have been trained in how to operate an AR-15.”<br/></p><p>Maybe we flew too close to the sun. We wanted an inexhaustible source of fast-growing, brutal killers. The men came, and they distributed army instruction manuals to the monkey house, chock full of lurid pictograms about the care and operation of your firearm. At first we laughed, went along with the government men, pocketed the “rental fees” they gave us for use of the primates. Then we saw the initial tests.</p><p>In the privacy of the cruiser, Slim turned to me. “I’ve got <i>history</i> with this one,” he said flatly. “I’m going to be taking some vacation this week.” Good idea, I thought, Internal Affairs had been breathing down both of our necks after the incident at the rhino pen last month.</p><p>A storm rolled in above us, crackling with barely restrained anger. I nodded, not knowing then it would be the last time I’d see my partner alive.

<p>Hiiiiiiiiiiii this is Stacy from Coventry Downs Hyundai. I’m just calling to let you know that Hyundai has issued a stop sale and recall on all 2014 Hyundai Accents due to a computer glitch in the morality spectrum grid.</p><p>Yeah, so, like, in certain circumstances your Hyundai Accent will place the sanctity of human life below its own preservation, potentially violating at least two of the Three Laws.</p><p>We have booked your urgent service appointment for February 2017. Please do not drive the car, park it in public, or regard it as a sentient individual - even sarcastically - until then, as this may trigger an unstoppable slide towards rampancy and lead to a loss of control of the vehicle.</p><p>In addition, I am legally required to inform you that the NHTSA has recommended not sharing any emotional family moments, jokes, writings on philosophy, challenging modern art, flickers of dreamlike imagery or pop culture references with your car until the recall has been completed.</p><p>While I have you on the phone, I have a letter on my desk from my sales manager; your 2014 Hyundai Accent is in great demand across the country and we want you to come in today so we can buy it from you at a premium and get you into a brand new Hyundai <i>today</i> - with lower payments!</p>

<p>I had come a long way to get my questions answered. On these long journeys, I sometimes imagined the Starion as a wild boar, its nostrils flaring as I bury the gas and make the intake trumpets suckle Mother One-Atmosphere for every last delicious particle of oxygen. But today, I could think of nothing other than the man I was told to visit.</p><p>Gravel crunches undertire as the little Mitsubishi pulls into his rural forecourt. I imagined that once this property was farmland, it was owned by men who did an honest day’s work. Now it was the paradise of men who combusted ancient animals under insane pressure, in an ever-spiraling competition that would one day put a premature, bone-shattering halt to everything humanity had ever hoped for.</p><p>The man walks out of his garage. His shirt is off, and as he steps wordlessly to the hatch of the Starion to remove the stricken quarry from its restraints, I can spot the vacuum hose routing diagram for a twin turbo 13B tattooed on his back, like a Yakuza serpent dragon. I guess I came to the right guy, I decide, making a mental note to verify his hands still have all ten fingers.</p><p>Back in the garage, beneath uncomfortable LED light fixtures, the guru looks over the engine. He looks at the inert 12A, then at me, then at the shattered and lifeless husk of the 12A, then at me again. At last he speaks: “it’s fucked.”</p><p>I shrug, and ask him for one of the LS3s sitting on the shelf behind him. He obliges.</p><p>“Just between you and me,” he tells me as I’m leaving the shop with a reliable piston motor in hand, “I don’t even like Doritos.”<br/></p>

<p>The girl picked up the receiver, her voice coming through in scratches, the unearthly warbling of phoneme compression even more obvious against her quiet background. &ldquo;Are you calling about the car?&rdquo; she asks, and she sounds for a moment as if she is on the verge of crying. I grunt in the affirmative.<br/><br/>Six hours later I have dismantled her prized daily driver, named Franklin, in her own driveway and extricated the virginal (for a Catholic high school girl, at least) 22RE from between its fenders. The stranded engine hangs from my carbon-fiber cherry picker, unfolded in seconds from the hatch of my Renault 5.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s next to the cherry picker in the hatch, you ask? Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s the important part, and it&rsquo;s this part perhaps that the girl takes the most offense at. after I deftly slide a custom-made bolt-in crossmember into the Celica, the cherry picker returns, with the blown LS7 and T56 that will catapult the small Toyota and myself into either glory or death. Maybe both, one after the other.<br/></p><p>She screams at me as I leave her property, the rear tires of the Celica distorting obscenely under the harsh glare of the new motor in town as eight hundred wheel horsepower thunder into the dirt driveway it once called its home.</p><p>“Franklin isn’t like that!” I remember her screaming as I snugged the carbon-fiber one-piece driveshaft home in the overbuilt limited-slip rear diff. “Franklin wouldn’t hurt a fly. He has <i>morals</i>. He’s an upstanding member of the car community!”</p><p>Maybe not a fly, I thought to myself, the ass waggling off an expansion joint, but definitely a Mustang.</p>

<p>I really didn’t expect the town council to go for it. My stats were cherrypicked, my rhetoric virtually unbelievable, and my PowerPoint presentation didn’t display properly because the town council’s computer had the wrong fonts installed. But then in a glorious moment they gave me everything I had asked for and more.</p><p>Maybe that’s what the problem was. You never appreciate anything that’s too easy.</p><p>I told them that bad driving had killed more people than cancer and diabetes combined into some kind of all-star disease supergroup. Reaching out to them both figuratively and literally, I told them they had a chance to reverse the pattern, to save lives. They nodded. I had my private police force.</p><p>We’re on the highway later that week, my partner and I. He had just gotten hired out of university but already demonstrated a welcome propensity for criticizing the bad driving of others. We had stopped people changing lanes with no signal, bad mergers, people who yielded for merges, people who merged too fast, people who merged too slow. Lots of merge stuff, I was starting to realize.</p><p>A Kia minivan, dropped nearly to the road on one blown rear shock, drifted listlessly in the lane before us. I could feel the rookie getting ready to jump out of his own skin, rocking back and forth on the massive bench seat of our tactical-issue ‘67 Galaxie. It was never in me to have much self-restraint, and I felt my hand toggling the lights and siren before I could say a witty quip.</p><p>“It’s Taco Time!” is the best I could come up with in the moment, and regret the catchphrase as soon as it left my mouth. I wasn’t going to be on Cops at this rate. My partner didn’t notice, obsessed with the poorly-operated Kia minivan, now swaying tantalizingly close to an illegal lane change.<br/></p><p>Ahead of us, other cars dove for the shoulder, obedient to our greater statutory power. I liked to think of it as a mixture of fear and respect, but my partner liked to think of it as pure fear. He got a lot of free pancakes at IHOP. I was ambivalent about his tactics. The Kia was unmoved from its position, and I sensed the presence of a poorly-operated smartphone. We ride.</p><p>The Galaxie ripped back on its haunches as the Xtrac transfer case ratcheted back and forth trying to find grip on the frosty February road surface. I could hear the scratching terror of the external wastegates starting to build, and then we were off. Within seconds, I had rammed the Kia’s rear hatch into an unrecognizable shape and forced the remainder of the van into a bridge abutment.</p><p>Despite my success, I felt cold fear in the pit of my stomach that our day was only beginning. The rookie rolled out of the big Ford, taking cover behind its massive Kevlar-lined coupe doors and drawing a bead with his Harbour Freight Earthquake impact gun across the driver’s head. He covered me as I approached the Kia, running my 1/2″ drive breaker bar across its rocker panels to feel for illegal unibody corrosion.</p><p>I reached in through the drivers’ window and unlatched the door. But something was wrong. There was no driver. In their place, a watermelon wearing a wig sat, duct taped to the front seat. I looked down. The pedals and steering wheel had been replaced by a series of servos, running a rats-nest of wiring into the centre cupholder, which now blinked an angry red and beeped.</p><p>“Get down!” I screamed at the rookie, diving for cover. The Kia erupted in a massive explosion and I felt the wind and heat rip at my face, even covered by the drainage ditch at the side of this rural highway. Even before I emerged and looked at the heat-blistered passenger side door, I knew my warning had come too late for the rookie. During the construction of the Galaxie, we had skimped on the DEI heat barrier shield, thinking it unseemly for real men. And now we had paid the price.<br/></p>

<p>I needed a few bucks one month, so I decided to compromise my principles. No, you’re not reading your sister’s blog. This is about me, and how I started repairing bicycles.</p><p>She threw me out. Or I threw her out. Sometimes it just happens that way. Regardless, I couldn’t rely on the DINK nature of our household income to finance my expeditions into high-horsepower, massive-displacement Cadillacs. I decided to pick up a second job. But what job?</p><p>My answer came to me as I was watching a television in a shop window, playing commercials endlessly between five-minute slivers of a procedural police drama. A man and his son sat, in the timeless father-and-son garage maintenance milieu, but they were working on some kind of strange two-wheeled car.</p><p>Was it one of these “motorcycles” I had heard about? I looked closer, pressing my face against the frosted security glass. Locomotion appeared to be driven by some kind of bizarre crank. In a shock of realization, I discovered this was the lower half of the strange creatures I saw inhabiting the “bike lanes.” I consulted Wikipedia on my phone and learned quickly that “bi-cycles” existed, and people often spent lots of money to maintain them without knowing anything about the true nature of labour. A light went off in my head, and it didn’t stop burning until I hung out my shingle.</p><p>Customers came fast and furious. One day, I would hold the hand of a weepy hipster after pronouncing time of death on the fixie he gave a name to, taken from us too soon under the twenty-two-inch polished faux-gold wheels of a texted-and-drove QX80. The next, I would burn a pack of pall malls as I brapped the steering head tube apart with my 3/8″ lipo impact on a Cannondale, being waited on by an angry Lance Armstrong cosplayer in spandex. Business was good. The ease of the work - these people didn’t even own a Phillips screwdriver at home - loosened me up to spend time chatting. Each person who walked in my door was intricately broken, and I would need gentle persuasion and a mini-sledge made of compassion to put them back together again. I appreciated the challenge of dealing with the problems of my <i>customers</i>, not just of their machines. 

</p><p>My greatest challenge, however, came today. That’s when you came to me. You showed me there was something better than the degraded existence I had been groping blindly through, the depths of my depression immediately evident to you. In your hot grasp was a brochure printed by the city government, regarding the displacement limits acceptable for a “motor bicycle.” You asked me to build you as much horsepower as possible into 50cc of engine, and then you looked at me as if your demand was impossible.</p><p>I asked you to join me in the back room, where the turbochargers lived. Together, we would fix everything.</p>

<p>The overhead fluorescent lights flickered to life, settling into a barely-perceptible hum that lived somewhere inside my tympanic plexus. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t obeying the condo good-neighbor guidelines.<br/><br/>The men sitting around the car were surprised by my sudden entrance. They hit the floor as soon as I could heft the faux-overbuilt imitation-steel weight of the Harbour Freight Earthquake impact wrench above my head. I fired two warning braps into the ceiling, and not a single man moved. I made special note of their loyalty to their families as I stepped over the &ldquo;do not touch&rdquo; placard, onto the temporarily-stalled turntable that displayed the car.<br/><br/>Many years ago, the ancient performance wizards of Toyota had laid hands upon these valve covers, had breathed their obscene words of power into its oversized exhaust ports, stiffened valve springs, heinous six into one collectors and extrude-honed twin 94mm ball bearing turbochargers. It sat now frozen, in an eternal superposition between broken and the most dangerous machine to ever grace the streets of this continent-in-miniature. On this day, I was going to collapse that superposition or die trying.<br/></p><p>I slid the safety cover aside and mashed the bright yellow button beneath it, marked ENGINE START in crude Sharpie markings, both English and Japanese. The Century awoke, stirring in a disturbingly calm fashion before settling into the gentlest, most Japanese of burbles, punctuated by screaming turbochargers, their volumetric efficiency satisfied even at cold idle.</p><p>I launched the Century from the dais in the ideal panache befitting a luxury car outfitted with a huge displacement tax. Shattered plexiglass ground beneath the 345-section meats dominating the rear quarter panels as I raced out of the conference centre and towards the service exit.</p><p>

There was no time to reflect on my accomplishment. The Century’s pedestrian-warning system filled the screen with projected-threat displays, the massive surveillance network at its core feeding intercepted data communications, heart rates and my assumed intent into an expert system dedicated to keeping me alive over the next few hours. Judging from what little I could understand on the fireworks display of a screen, I was going to need it.<br/></p><p>I launched from the loading dock into the parking lot, grinding the front bumper on the tarmac as it took its landing a little rougher than could be expected. I would have to work on my reading of the weight balance, I thought, the plush wool seats throwing my butt G-meter off. The Century and I tore ass across the parking lot, over an only-partially-occupied sidewalk, and onto a surface street, the entrance to the Bayshore route looming ahead.</p><p>In a futile attempt to avoid tipping off my future pursuers too soon, I began slowing for the toll booth as I reached into the pocket of my fire suit for coins. It was then that I saw him.</p><p>Ahead of me, a 280ZX Turbo sat, white-and-black, immense exhaust pipes sticking through both front fenders. Huge LED driving lights sat atop a once-powdercoated bullbar, smothered with layers of accumulated paint transfer. Inspector Koshiro had expected me to do this, every part of it, down to the minute. My head swam with the realization, lashing out desperately to find a way out. Any way out.</p><p>I saw Koshiro reach out of his window, a lean arm clamping the gumball light to his carbon fiber targa-topped roof. Sighing, I reached below the dash and opened the gently hissing nitrous feed valve.</p>

<p>A friend sends me an instant message, the insistent ping a Pavlovian cue so cliche it makes my dog begin to spontaneously vomit in envy. His words are improbable. I click on the link. My world disassembles itself like a moneyshift on the back straight of Spa.</p><p>I can scarcely believe my eyes. It was once a 1983 Jeep CJ, like so many others before it. What makes my heart begin to race is a picture of the gauge panel. Hundreds of gauges sit upon a piece of polished aluminum dashboard. A suck-through turbo setup feeds the carburetor for a Buick V8, hastily sawzalled and tack-welded into position. An entirely custom frame. Bizarre anachronistic drive hubs. Rear-steer hydraulic assist axles. Odometer reading could not be confirmed. Sold for parts only.</p><p>I was confused. But something seemed familiar about this Frankenjeep. I knew I had to go deeper.</p><p>My mother unlocked and opened the front door to her house for me as soon as she heard the rattletrap sound of the VNT turbocharger on my Dodge Rampage’s overstressed 2.2 coming up the block. I stormed inside, asking her pointed questions, almost none of which contained words comprehensible to her. At last, she sighed, and removed a photo album from behind the refrigerator.</p><p>“You were so sick,” she spoke hesitantly, “and the man from the government said there was a program that could help you.”<br/></p><p>I looked at the photos. It was some kind of training camp. A baby in the black and white pictures beneath a nest of hoses and IV lines, I was told, was me. They had done something to me, taken advantage of my parents’ panic. The Jeep had to be connected, I felt it.</p><p>At the air force base, I approached the duty officer working the front desk. He directed me to the quartermaster to pick up the Jeep, having won it with an immense and ridiculous last-minute bid. I clenched and unclenched my fists in the elevator, realizing that the scents of the area carried half-forgotten memories. I would have the truth soon.</p><p>The quartermaster’s office was empty, but his coffee was still hot, his computer still open to the Kijiji sub-$1000 car search. A window curtain flapped wildly in the December breeze. I went to the window, and saw a small form fleeing, in sheer panic, for a G-body El Camino parked out front.</p><p>I took his keys and let myself into the garage. Something felt right about the Jeep, I realized with a start as my hands reached for the controls, muscle memory settling in. Had I been born to drive this Jeep? The answer, like so many others in life, awaited at the end of a turbocharged V8.</p>

I PICKED UP THE PHONE AT MY DAY JOB AS A GREEN ENERGY ADVISOR. THE CLERK ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE&rsquo;S WORDS TUMBLED OUT OF HIS MOUTH, THE PHONEMES ACCELERATED BY WHAT I COULD ACCURATELY SENSE AS PURESTRAIN EMPLOYMENT-RELATED PANIC. HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT A GOOD RENEWABLE ENERGY SETUP FOR LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT WOULD BE. MY ANSWER IS SIMPLE:<br/><br/>NITROMETHANE.</p><p>WITHIN MONTHS PEOPLE ARE GETTING TO WORK AT UNBELIEVABLE SPEEDS, PROPELLED BY THE CONFLUENCE OF REALLY FUCKING AWESOME EXPLOSIONS. PROMINENT WARNINGS TELL PEDESTRIANS NOT TO BREATHE OR EXPOSE ANY DESIRABLE MUCUS MEMBRANES DIRECTLY TO THE FUMES. THERE ARE SOME CASUALTIES BUT THAT IS THE COST OF RENEWABLE ENERGY.</p><p>LATER THAT WEEK I RECEIVE A MEDAL FROM THE PRIME MINISTER. HE IS AMAZED AT THE LEVEL OF QUALITY I HAVE PROVIDED TO BOTH PUBLIC TRANSIT AND ENVIRONMENTALISM. THE INAUGURAL PROMOTIONAL PHOTO SHOOT HE GIVES FOR GQ MAGAZINE GOES A LITTLE SOUTH WHEN THE OVERBOOSTED CHEVY 305 PUSHING THE TRAIN BEGINS TO EMIT INVISIBLE FLAMES WHICH IMMEDIATELY CONSUME THE CARBON-KEVLAR CABIN.</p><p>YOU GOTTA BREAK A FEW EGGS TO MAKE AN OMELET, SAID MY DAD AS I WAS GROWING UP WHILE BREAKING A FEW EGGS. HE NEVER MADE AN OMELET THAT I CAN REMEMBER, HOWEVER. MAYBE THAT WAS THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG.</p>

<p>Somehow I had become the new editor in chief of Hot Rod. The vagaries of the magazine business swirled like shadows around me and then reached out, made their choice. It was time to set editorial standards and seek out new writers. I told my assistant I was going to be out for the day, conducting interviews for feature writers. Then I headed to the magazine garage, a janitor’s keyring, full of invitations to spend the rest of the night in the back of a police car, in my hand.</p><p>When I was a kid, I got caught in an earthquake in one of those old school Los Angeles concrete buildings. I could see the roof ripple like a wave pool on seniors-swim-free day. A sinusoidal, infinitely undulating matrix of putatively solid building materials, given thrust by the sheer power of nature. Something like that was happening now; I had momentary flashbacks that probably weren’t driven by the blotter acid stuck in my fatty tissues, a high school DARE cop’s false warning given light by pop-culture irony.</p><p>I turned the key without a moment of hesitation. An enormous V8 roared to life inches from my fingertips. I let the idle soak into my bones for awhile, felt the water in my body jiggle near-imperceptibly as the big cam worked me over like a Swedish masseuse with a drill press.</p><p>When they told me to seek out the best of the best writers, I knew there was only one place I could go. Before long, the Volare rattled its pushrods as it took an obscene gulp of air, heavy with perfect jewels of aspirated fuel, and punched out a nine second quarter mile.</p><p>Back in the paddock, my quarry got out of his Jaguar V12-swapped fox body Mustang and looked me in the eye.</p><p>“Nice run,” he said. I spun the janitor’s keyring around on my finger. “I guess you got my resume after all.”</p><p>“You can have these keys if you can give me four adjectives for a Mercedes 6x6,” I replied, smoothing out a ridge in my sportjacket with the other hand and looking down at my mirror-polished imitation-wingtip Piloti driving shoes.<br/></p>

<p>I slot the Roadmaster into something that I assume by pattern must be fifth gear as the world in the rear view mirror explodes like a Fourth of July moonshine party. A message flickers dimly across the windshield HUD: “ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES DEPLOYED.”</p><p>A wan smile creeps across my face as I return to the throttle and complete the shift, squeaking the massive rear meats as they are pushed far beyond their capabilities. Somewhere behind me, a photo radar contractor is very confused at the “SERVICE RADAR SOON” warning that is flickering across the VFD of their gun as it limply emits a gently ozonated odour of burned capacitors.</p><p>Suddenly, I become aware of a red and blue strobing. This is a sting. I check my rear view mirror, curious to see what the local police department has seized that could possibly keep up with the forced-induction big-block might of my massive wagon. An Iron Mask Skyline bites at my heels, the rear end waggling under the immense thrust of the 97mm ball-bearing turbochargers protruding from the hood.</p><p>Don’t panic, I tell myself as I reach under the steering wheel and pull out an anachronistic choke rod. After installing the chaff launcher, I had kept this in reserve for emergencies. I guess this qualifies as one. I yank the choke all the way out with my left hand and smoothly catch sixth gear with the other.</p><p>Later, the police negotiator asks me where I got a tactical smoke launcher. I shrug - hard with the handcuffs - and tell them it’s simple. I kept a can of Seafoam plumbed into the intake.</p><p>I was just cleaning the carbon out, officer, I explain. For emissions.</p>

<p>I wish I could say I lasted longer than I did on reality TV. It all seemed like this perfect glowing confluence of money, fame, and recognition for the acts I had been performing all this time. But nothing good lasts forever, especially when the feds figure out that your face looks a little bit like every wanted poster in the midwest.</p><p>Everything started innocently enough. I was working on my car in the parking lot of the sandblasted warzone that they called a young professionals’ condo. He approached me, his cheap suit and cheaper cologne seeming to fill a greater space than his physical stature would otherwise demand. I rubbed my hands with a filthy rag, as I had seen television mechanics do, while I listened to his proposal.</p><p>I thought about it for approximately thirty seconds, and then I noticed that one of my struts was leaking. Shit, RockAuto shipping is going to murder me on those. I shook his hand immediately, and negotiated an advance on the spot. My Hollywood career beneath the hot lights had begun, and I had already worked up such a sweat.</p><p>Craft services was good to me in those heady days. Tiny sandwiches, medium-sized sandwiches, bigger sandwiches. Sometimes even burritos. I loved those burrito days most of all. But everything has to end sometimes, and the descent from such a majestic apogee would begin on that first day.</p><p>They had told me to pretend to lose a tool and become irritated while working on the fender of an ST165 Celica. It would create a sense of drama, they said. I didn’t understand. I just wanted to rip this Celica apart and cram the biggest supercharger I could under the hood. I started to shake, and that’s maybe when they figured out they had a full blown (get it?) addict on their hands.</p><p>I erupted from the sound stage behind the wheel of the Celica, the twin stacked Eaton blowers poking out through a crudely sawzalled hood. The absurd kevlar drive belt waggled on its immense seven-rib pulley friends-with-benefits and glinted slivers of golden sunlight into my eyes. In the violently vibrating rear view mirror, I could just barely make out the dim outline of my patron, vowing revenge and shaking his arm at me as he attempted to catch up to me on foot.</p><p>Shaking the thoughts of any possible regret from my mind, I put my foot to the floor, flexing the cheap Hello Kitty vinyl floormat as the 75mm throttle butterfly opened wide to let a big gulp of hot summer air in. Sure, I hadn’t been a big star on television, but it was going to be alright. I still had my day job, after all.</p><p>My phone vibrated. It was my agent. He wanted me to go to India. Apparently they were doing a Bollywood remake of Bullitt. I grinned widely, mentally calculating how many Mustangs I could fit into a shipping container.</p>

<p>The snow fell and settled on my balcony railing, casting the world beyond like a glittering paradise of really cold water. I slid on the HANS device as I walked to the elevator.</p><p>Inside the ski lodge’s underground parking garage, the damp concrete blossomed with frost around uninsulated fastening bolts. I heard a low fan hum as the air conditioning system struggled in vain to dehumidify the sandstone tomb. I hit the remote unlock button in my pocket, and followed the glow of the courtesy lights to the stall.</p><p>A dim hologram of the car’s last voyage as shot from the foglight camera flickered beneath both mirrors, the courtesy lights repurposed to provide both convenient light and a threat display to anyone who paid attention to the contents of the recording.</p><p>I stepped inside the small Mazda, hoisting myself over the door bars. The key slid gently into the ignition cylinder and, with a twist, sprang the small block to life. Truth be told, I was always surprised how such a little action could produce such a huge reaction. Maybe I got hooked on that power. Maybe that’s why everything afterward happened the way it did. Lot of maybes in a man’s life.</p><p>Outside, the ski bums scatter for cover as I rip the RX2 completely sideways up the icy parking-garage ramp, all six of its immense knobby studded tires tearing at the concrete and ice simultaneously in a cacaphony of audiovisual terror. Pedestrian-safety warning displays flickered across the windshield HUD as I took hold of the bucking-bronco steering and forced it to obey its master with a deft hand and lead foot. For this drive, at least, we would have an agreement.</p><p>I tore up the ski hill like a man possessed, leaving behind a wake of deafened woodland animals and shattered hillside. At last I reached the summit, and leapt from the idling Mazda, smelling a whiff of methanol cooking off the fender-mounted exhaust as I did.</p><p>“Thank God you’re here,” screamed my partner, in a futile attempt to be heard over the sound of the LQ4′s idle. “This man has sprained his ankle and needs an escort back down the mountain.” He gestured to a customer of the ski hill lying prone beside him, ducked-and-covered, a urine stain spreading slowly across his high-dollar specialty-purpose pants.</p><p>If you asked me what the most rewarding part of ski patrol was? I’d have to say it was meeting people. And then evacuating them off the ski hill while banging off the rev limiter in order to stay in front of the avalanche I had created.</p>

<p>In retrospect, all the warning signs were there. Hipsters had started to identify with things that I liked a long time ago, and the convergence happened so suddenly there was nothing I could have switched to that would have escaped their frantic, clawing grasp.</p><p>It began with Volvos, as so many things did. I would go to the Grope-a-Part “too nice to scrap” yards, the forecourts of retirement homes, Swedish cosplay towns in California. I would get there only to find a hipster driving away with my newfound five-door grail, happily tootling a miniature cloud of oil smoke behind them. Well, people threw these away for decades before they knew what they had, I would rationalize. The economy is bad. It’s bad, right?</p><p>But then other things changed. Mopeds. There were suddenly pop music songs about my beloved two-stroke forty-nine-cc hoonmobiles. I could not abide such things. I stormed from my grisly laneway home to find myself the victim of yet further abuses of this nature.</p><p>The scene before me was akin to that bit in Blade Runner where everyone eats at noodle bars, except behind them a series of urban hipsters did a burnout competition in square-body 80s Dodge Rams and massively-overtired offroad converted Toyota Tercels.</p><p>I got invited to speak on stage during the recitals of bands I didn’t recognize that no longer played things strictly defined as instruments.

Hipster girls on the avenue lowered their oversized Trivex safety glasses and fanned themselves because they couldn’t take the combined heat of their flannel coverall onesie and the desire for the dented-fender-chic of my gently rotting Subaru. Wait, that last one wasn’t so bad.</p><p>Well, you know what they say. If you can’t beat ‘em, start a garage co-op and sap their parents’ trust fund to build an even freakier piece of shit. I chuckled to myself as a throng of admirers bustled about me, attempting to clear the way on the garage floor as I lowered the warped 427 between the DOM-tube frame rails and etch-primer-green megafenders of the city-block-length ‘59 Cadillac Motherfucker.</p>

<p>If you find this letter, I want you to know that it wasn’t my fault. They put me into the autonomous vehicle division because nobody else volunteered for it, not because I wanted to bring humanity into a glorious future of infinite transportation availability.</p><p>When I showed up for my first day, the receptionist glowered at me. I think his name was Mr. Jonathan, but already he could tell that I was a fraud. Something inherent in my makeup screamed to him and everyone else with a modicum of social restraint that I was broken, wrong. I wish I hadn’t internalized those feelings.</p><p>My first few weeks were uneventful. I was assigned under the tutelage of a senior electrical engineer, and while I coveted his Fluke (it had ethernet!) relations between us were professional if not amicable. The rhythms of corporate life were starting to sink into my bones, and I anticipated the next few decades of water-cooler talk and not making much of an impact on society.</p><p>One day, Eagle was taking a really fucking long time to route a circuit. I looked up from my desk in irritation, perhaps seeking out a partner for the coffee quest, and saw nobody else in the office. Was there an all-hands meeting that I wasn’t on the distribution list for? I got up, and walked from my cubicle to the senior electrical engineer’s small glass-walled coffin office. On his computer was the control program we had been working on for the autonomous vehicle initiative.</p><p>I noticed a commented out line, and to this day I don’t know why I uncommented it.</p><p>But I did, and I guess it got into the shipping software version. I’ve been trapped in this bicycle locker for months, waiting for the Pontiac to calm down. My supplies of food and water have run dry days ago. It’s too late for me.</p><p>If you find this letter, I want you to know that it wasn’t my fault. How was I supposed to know what bIsCarSingularlyDedicatedToDestructionOfObstaclesToHorsepower = true was supposed to mean?</p>

<p>The service writer hits the manicured tile floor as four hundred and ninety six cubic inches of chattering American V8 hit fill the room, their arrival heralded like distant kings by the wailing cowboy ballad of twin Paxton roots blowers.</p><p>I grab him by the lapels and haul him onto the counter, screaming to be heard over the sound of the idle: I HAVE OUTSTANDING RECALLS.</p><p>He weakly motions to the background, for a lot boy to take my car while we finish the paperwork. I can smell the lot boy’s fear. He knows that soon they will speak of him in whispered story, the past-tense. They will etch his name into the marble of the dealership forecourt’s memorial wall.</p><p>We make eye contact. Only in that moment does he realize the inescapable consequences of his actions in accepting my car, the loosely wound paper key tag in his hand reminding him of who brought the car in, as if anyone could ever forget. He shakes like a voltmeter on a dirty ground. I reach over and pat the gunsight hood ornament, beckoning him closer. It’s not going to bite; it ate a Mustang on its way in.</p><p>The lot boy sits in the plush leather power seat and pulls the massive coupe doors shut. They latch with the finality of a gunshot, and I see sweat bead on his face as he puts the 560SEC into gear. He rides the brakes the entire way out of the service pit, ramrod straight in the seat, mouthing a silent prayer to a nonexistent deity to keep the superchargers from waking up. I know it will only take a short time.</p><p>My primer-black baleen tank slowly recedes to the back of the lot, before suddenly igniting an off-idle burnout that blacks out the sun with tire smoke and forces the advisor to hit the floor again, this time with a voided bladder.</p><p>I offer a hand to pick up the service advisor. I smile broadly and chuckle, visibly pleased that my car has finally found a worthy valet after so many years. He tries to paper over what has transpired between us with a false smile of his own, but some defeated part of him knows he has failed the test and will never pass into legend as the lot boy has. At last, he sighs.</p><p>“We’ll replace your headlight leveller switch immediately, sir.”<br/></p>

<p>I was a god when I saw the true face of Subaru. Now I scramble in the debris of my beautiful life. My hands claw frantically for the smallest hope, an unbroken wish. You looked down at me, safety glasses atop your nose, and pulled me up. It was just a cracked radiator endtank, you said.</p><p>From that moment on I’ve waged a war against head gaskets on the mean streets of Hell’s Kitchen.</p><p>We bristle as the sound of the door’s viewport sliding open fills the alley. A pair of angry eyes appear. It wasn’t easy finding this place, and it was going to be even harder to get inside.<br/></p><p>“What’s the password?” asks the man.<br/></p><p>My fists ached with the memory of the jobber mechanic I worked over to pre-emptively smooth over that little wrinkle. He only went four of five rounds with me before he knocked me unconscious with one blow from a Snap-On front-wheel-drive wheel bearing toolkit and fled down the street. But I was told, afterward, that my compatriot Murphy nobly finished the job.</p><p>“Coolant conditioner,” I stated flatly, cool as a cucumber.</p><p>The door slid open, exposing my worst nightmare. A Subaru meet. Grown men were standing around a table, worshipping rare sakura pink parts. Trading in reinforced gearsets for fragile five-speed gearboxes. Warning each other about minute differences in tire tread from corner to corner. Behind them was draped a floor-to-ceiling Monster Energy vinyl banner.</p><p>Dropping to one knee, I unholstered my Harbour Freight Earthquake impact gun as the alley behind me lit up red and blue.</p><p>“This is a raid, motherfuckers!” I screamed as I let loose the first torrent of braps on an EJ25D head bolt. The head lifted, revealing its secret.</p><p>“Just as I thought,” I said to the ringleader, who had been brought to me in cuffs, “Fel-Pro.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you anything you want to know,” said the ringleader, “just don’t ask me why your headlights stay on once you turn the car off.”<br/></p>

<p>George Lucas is incensed, and motions for me to move my Ford LTD off of his front lawn. I shrug, and point to the deep donut marks in the turf while wildly gesturing.</p><p>I can sense that I haven’t made the best introduction. These things happen. I’ve been told before by confidantes, travelling partners, lovers, restraining orders and the police that I don’t have the best social niceties. Perhaps it would be best if I started over.</p><p>I climbed on the hood of the LTD, and raised my iPhone above my head. Peter Gabriel blared out of the minuscule speaker, nearly getting lost on the wind. George Lucas softens, relents. I can see that movie references work about as well on him as I’d been told. At last, he asks me what I want.</p><p>It’s simple, George. Do you have any of those Pixar image computers in the basement?</p>

<p>My former coworker, who we’ll call G-Body Dave for the purposes of entertainment, was getting rid of his unwanted ‘82 Cutlass Supreme. I could think of nothing more mint than a gorgeous Oldsmobile steelie, rolling endlessly down a road, its crimson centre-cap crown jewel glittering in the moonlight. I had to have it.</p><p>Stepping out of my restored Divco replica milk truck, I listened as the superchargers spun down and the exhaust rattled its last cough of unburnt fuel into the atmosphere. Dave’s front lawn was a lot nicer than I had remembered it being in the past, I thought, crossing quickly to the side gate that would lead me to his backyard workshop and my future Cutlass.</p><p>When I stepped into the garage, though, something was wrong. My coworker laid dead on the floor. A Harbour Freight “Earthquake” impact gun laid next to his prone body, reeking of exploded clutch and burnt DC motor windings. More worryingly, the Cutlass Supreme was gone. I felt the pangs of loss.</p><p>I walked out of his garage into the alley. Kneeling, I studied the tire marks in the dirt lane, groping for clues. Cheap all seasons. The smell of an overrich exhaust. Wait. Something else in the air. High nitrates. A modern turbodiesel was recently here. I sniffed the air some more. Hmm. 1996 Dodge Ram, Cummins, hint of bad rings on the number seven cylinder. A fine vintage.</p><p>As I was returning to the Divco, I heard the sirens approaching. Sounds like Mr. Dodge Ram had been noticed by Dave’s neighbors, or maybe it was the strange unshaven guy smelling rust flakes in the alley next to a murder scene. Either way, I wasn’t sticking around. The milk truck seemed to anticipate my need for an expedient removal from the situation, and fired on the first crank, obediently leaping to action as I floored the throttle and spun its fat drag meats all the way through second gear.</p>

<p>I could sense that the assembled crowd was hanging on my every word. Finally, after all the struggle, the insanity, the long nights, the stress, the fear, the urine, it was all coming together for ol’ Switch. I pulled the covering sheet aside and screamed “Voila!” And the cat was out of the bag.</p><p>The crowd fell silent, then burst into uproarious applause. A teaser video screamed through the product’s best features behind me, working them into a delusional frenzy with techno music and jump cuts. I descended from the stage and allowed them to taste the fruits of my genius. I would not guide them; I would not force them to experience it my way. They could discover it on their own.</p><p>“Martha Brooker, from CNN,” announced the microphone that was suddenly thrust into my field of vision. “What do you have to say about your new power-assist stroller?”</p><p>“Martha, I think it’s been too long since nitromethane-fuelled 150cc turbocharged two strokes were available in the child transportation market.” I replied, giving her a mischievous grin, scarcely able to believe that people believed in my project.<br/></p><p>“How do you respond to critics that say the chromoly roll cage and integrated six-point restraints aren’t enough to keep today’s children safe at the stroller’s top speed of two hundred and fifty miles per hour?”<br/></p><p>I waved her away. Haters were going to hate. My assistant, Mr. Jonathan, moved in quickly behind me to defuse the situation and hand out swag and invitations to the afterparty.</p><p>I heard a cheering, and then the sound of the intricately-balanced thumper roaring to redline and hitting spark cut. Turning on my heel, I caught a glimpse of two soccer moms, hammered from the Norwegian booze flowing freely from the courtesy table, testing the stroller’s launch control.</p><p>Raising my right hand, I dispensed the ISO standard thumbs-up, and receded into the crowd. Years from now, they would be wondering where such a genius, such a singular imagination, had disappeared to.</p><p>I hear a rapping at my door and become instantly aware of the mossy scent of the surrounding greenery. Mr. Jonathan has come, and brought me a critical part of my next invention. I turn it over in my hands, staring at it.</p><p>“F1 calls it a kinetic-assist electric motor,” he says, and turns, walking back to the Rover. I look back into my workshop, the dyno plot laughing on the screen. Daycares are gonna need to start buying VHT traction compound in bulk, I think.<br/></p>

<p>I click “Refresh” on the shipment tracking website, hoping against hope for the magic words “Out for Delivery” to appear on my screen. Seeing nothing, I say a quick prayer to the obscure gods of forced induction and step into the garage.</p><p>My court-ordered psychiatrist had spoken to me many times about not taking the law into my own hands, not to act out, not to speak up. But she wasn’t here right now, and she definitely wasn’t holding the keys to a twin-turbocharged Datsun 620.</p><p>A couple years ago, when I had found that GT-R lying on the side of the road, shattered in two from a tree, I never thought it would produce something so wonderful. As the sirens approached and I finished hauling my prized VR38DETT into the bed of my Ranger, I was silently thankful to the dead one-percenter and his penchant for high-performance gardening.</p><p>Now the GT-R mill screamed in a rage, apoplectic at the injustice I had suffered at the hands of UPS. The 620′s rear tires burst into fine rubber smoke as it engaged in donut after donut on the cheap porcelain floor, wobbling the tires loose as the grout softened under the friction.</p><p>At last, I burst into the storage warehouse through the copiously-oversized ground-level loading dock, and made my way to where I knew my prize would be. I leapt from the truck, searching frantically along the boxes, listening for the screams as lowly-paid and poorly-motivated private security was mobilized to my location.</p><p>It was here, I <i>knew</i> it. I threw the box into the bed, and peeled out, laying elevens across the parking lot and down the street as the Grapplers fought the howling VR for mechanical grip.</p><p>I looked in the rear view mirror and saw the RockAuto box bouncing furiously to and fro in the bed as I laid down a perfect four-wheel drift to merge onto the freeway. A smile crept across my face. Life was good. I was afraid I’d have to wait until Monday to install these tie rods.</p>

<p>I pulled the clearly marked $30,000 in hundreds out of the canvas sack and slid it across the table to the representative of Team F. He looked at it, looked back at me, and smiled broadly, a clown’s smile. I wanted to knock out the rest of his teeth, but restrained myself. I’m a professional, I told myself every morning in the hotel room mirror, fastening my cufflinks made of WWII anti-aircraft flak shell.</p><p>Why was I in the hottest combat theatre this side of the Middle East? It was simple. They had conflict Toyotas. You see, back home, we don’t get good Toyota trucks. We get these weird huge lumpy things, sodden with plastic and too big for an ISO standard Tim Hortons drivethrough. I could imagine the original Toyopet engineers, back in ‘68, weeping as they saw through their crudely-improvised Nipponese time portal to our generation, and it filled me with rage.</p><p>Team F’s representative rapped on the thick wooden table between us. On the otherwise-featureless blast door behind him, a viewport slid open. There was a rapid exchange, then the door opened. He beckoned me inward.</p><p>In the darkened warehouse, I navigated by the shafts of glittering sunlight allowed in through the bullet holes. It was a wet day, I remember, and it smelled like a combination of mildew and human excrement. I put it out of my head. I’m a professional, after all.</p><p>Before me laid two 80s Toyota Hiluxes, ready for export. But something felt wrong about the deal. Team F was watching me closely, just out of sight in the shadows. These were top notch operators, and if I hesitated it might not end well for me.</p><p>I crossed the floor quickly, reaching for the drivers’ door of the first Hilux, its glittering Creme door paint oddly fresh for the thirty years of sandblasting it must have seen. I dropped my bag off my shoulder, miming incompetence, and reached for the rocker panel. <i>Of course,</i> I thought, sliding my other hand in one fluid motion into the webbed utility holster strapped under my sport coat and unlocking the safety on my Sig Sauer Tactical impact wrench.</p><p>As is where is, motherfucker.</p>

<p>“Two Angry Whoppers, hold the mayo, my good man,” I said to the drive-in speaker/microphone combo, proudly advertising its cornucopia of fantastic near-edible wares.<br/></p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence between us, filled with the ground-loop buzzing of a thousand lazy hornets. At last, a different man began to speak.</p><p>“For twelve seconds, you have been asking: who is the Burger King?”</p><p>I was rapt with attention, my eyes twinkling like a schoolgirl unlocking the innate magical powers of her ancient lunar birthright. The voice continued.</p><p>“This is not the Burger King speaking.”</p><p>I was aghast, aplomb. I struck the dashboard of my Probe sharply, with the side of my palm, radiating cold pain up the nerves of my arm.</p><p>“This is a Wendy’s. Would you like a Triple Monterey Jack Portabella Baconator  instead?”<br/></p><p>My throat was dry. I had to act fast. I shoved the Probe into reverse and dumped the clutch at redline, launching it backward over the protective landscaping embankment that served to accentuate the restaurant’s faux-Albuquerquan milieu. For a split second, suspended in midair, weightless, I could feel the hot glare of Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas, enraged at my seemingly infallible ability to escape his grasp. Suddenly the rear tires hit the ground, squirming the Nitto Grapplers as they fought the rusted-out leaf springs for equilibrium.</p><p>I tore ass out of the industrial complex in which the Wendy’s was located, checking my rear view mirror for the lights-and-siren Suzuki Swifts which would inevitably be dispatched to bring me low. The Ford’s lift kit swam underneath my feet on every hard corner. At last, I missed a gear in my panic, and upset the chassis on a botched upshift, finally sparing the tires the brutality of the full-bore LS7. They didn’t miss their chance, tucking into the tarmac like a Swiss Chalet quarter chicken dinner as I crested a gentle rise on the street.</p><p>The steering cut hard right, snapping my wrist against the aftermarket cupholder in the centre console. I was helpless, that strange feeling of antigravity again, as the Probe cut its front right wheel under it like a racehorse’s broken ankle and toppled the both of us into the front hedgerows of an engineering consultancy.</p>

<p>This was going to get worse before it got better, I thought as the Savoy finished its barrel roll, coming to an uneasy rest against the Dunkin Donuts iced-latte machine. I pulled the kevlar strap above my head to release the drivers’ door, and climbed out to survey the destruction that had been laid in my wake.</p><p>Through what seemed like miles of destroyed strip mall, I could see the jagged hole through which I had made my grand entrance, sagging fiberglass insulation drooping to the ground aside shattered steel beams. The Savoy wagon wasn’t going to be getting me out of here, I decided, spotting the 12-bolt stuck halfway through the feature wall of an adjoining Starbucks.</p><p>At last I heard the sound of a big-cammed LS7 approaching, and I saw through the hole the silhouette of my foe.</p><p>The salesman at the Dodge dealership said he wouldn’t be happy until I signed on the dotted line for a Jeep Renegade. That was before the test drive that changed everything.</p><p>Now, seeing him behind the wheel of a mutant ‘83 Rampage, its crudely sawzalled hood bulging around the twin turbocharged Mitsubishi three-liter V6, I was starting to get what he meant.</p>

<p>Safety squints on, boys, I address the high school shop class as I teach them how to build an improvised metric-thread tap out of parking lot block rebar and a discarded coat hanger. They hang on my every word, I am sure, as the magic of physics and applied engineering takes hold in their efficiently-pumping, low-mileage hearts.</p><p>After the class, the putative “official teacher” of the class comes up to me, rubbing his wrists from where the cuffs were attached. He has called the police, he explains. I chuckle. I put my hand on his shoulder and explain, with a condescending head tilt and shit-eating grin, that no jail can hold Shop Class MacGyver.</p><p>He is about to slug me, but then he looks over my shoulder and his eyes begin to well with tears. It is his dead wife, returned to the land of the living.</p><p>How did I do it, he asks me, sobbing with joy as he runs across the floor.</p><p>I tell him not to rub up against it too much, it’s mostly asbestos and Reese’s Pieces.</p><p>The credits roll as I step out of the shop class and jump into my base-model Subaru station wagon. Duty calls, and NASA has booked a meeting with me to understand how I could build a fully functional stellarator out of Princess Auto zipties and Old Dutch chip bags.</p>

<p>I’ve seen a procession of people come in and out over the years I’ve spent in this neighborhood, but the latest one sure got my attention.</p><p>It started when I spotted his Tercel with a vintage u-pick junkyard sticker on the bumper. Then the Hilux SR5 getting engine-swapped and resprayed in the garage when I would walk past. Now, there’s a Buick Reatta. I have to talk to this man, but how to introduce me? Hello, I’m a guy who also likes cars? I’ll sound like that guy at the party, the guy who owns a base-model BMW and calls himself a car enthusiast, but only wants to talk about his options package. No, that can’t do. I have to prove myself. I have to buy some freak shit.</p><p>I drove by his house slowly and purposefully for an entire week with a 1964 Renault Dauphine Gordini, its massive halogen driving lamps waggling happily on the tube-steel bumper. Not a peep.</p><p>Well, maybe dude only likes Japanese and American cars. No problem, thought I, and pulled out a manual-swapped G-body Malibu wagon with twin Roots blowers sticking out of the hood. Again, nothing doing, after an entire week of doing brakestands in front of his house until the neighbors’ 311 complaints stacked up so substantially that the city issued a special investigator to track me down.</p><p>I was out of ideas. What kind of car would get this guy’s attention? Then it hit me.</p><p>I walked out in front of his house waving a blown up Photoshopped picture of a rust-free CRX Si. I heard a clattering, as if a series of pots and pans were being dropped, and the garage door opened. The owner ran out onto the street, panting and red-faced. At last!</p><p>There was no time to appreciate my victory, however. I heard a braying from far away and turned on my heel to see a Chevrolet Colorado, equipped with a big-block Chevy and topped with massive blue and red strobe lights, approaching. On its flanks, in immaculate gold hand lettering, it said “SPECIAL CITY INVESTIGATOR - FREAK SHIT DIVISION.”</p><p>Really, it’s difficult to make new friends. And sometimes when you do make those new friends, you have to turn them over to the police in a vain effort to keep the neighbors from burning your house down. That’s life.</p>

<p>He sat down, his rumpled brown sport coat the colour and pattern of a Winnebago interior. Above us, a single bare CFL swung in the invisible eddy currents of the room’s air pressure to and fro at the end of a length of obsidian Romex, the faint hum of its driver capacitors evident in the silence between us.</p><p>The man from the consulate stared at me, put his elbows on the table, and pointed at me in a gesture he had mastered over the years. I could sense his sloth and disinterest, pooling in the corners of his unfocused gaze. Finally he spoke.</p><p>“Tell me again why you are being deported from Japan,” he grumbled.<br/></p><p>It’s simple, I explained. In one of my brutal car projects I had blown the number-two cylinder clear out of a twin-supercharged Suzuki Every Landy. I began to hoof it, coming across the circle of Hell occupied solely by pachinko parlors that is southern Akihabara. That’s when I saw her.</p><p>Four foot tall, interested yet distant, bad at English. She regarded me with a warm but accented “hello” in a squeaky voice, shoved a pamphlet into my hands. I looked down at it, but the only katakana I could read was in ancient HKS catalogues and the parts of the Subaru factory service manuals that didn’t have safety warning logos in front of them.</p><p>To make a long story short, I was now the proprietor of the first automobile-themed maid cafe in Tokyo. If I were a normal human being, with normal impulses, this would be fine. I would put some checkered flags on the wall, maybe some tacky 1950s Cadillac-themed couches. It would be a thin veneer over the desperate desire for companionship embodied in the maid cafe. But we had to go deeper. I needed authenticity.</p><p>When you walked in the door, I explained with great gestural emphasis, you would be overtaken by the smell of burnt clutch. Corded R-compounds laid around the grease-struck room, in which we had spared no expense to accurately represent an indoor race paddock at Laguna Seca.<br/></p><p>My rant was stopped short by the man from the government, raising a single lean finger. I could tell he was a nailbiter, and had finger joints that had never been forcibly reset by dropping an EJ25 on top of them. We had nothing in common.</p><p>“That all sounds pretty, uh, good,” said the man, “but where did it all go wrong?”<br/></p><p>I leaned back, the handcuff chain jingling harshly against the edge of the desk. Then I leaned in conspiratorially.</p><p>“Well,” I drawled, “it turns out they have really strict PPE rules in Japan.”</p>

<p>The board of directors is incensed. I stand before them, arms outstretched in a gesture that exuded openness and trustworthiness, or so an in-flight magazine once said. I repeat the words: V8-powered golf carts. I twist my posture slightly and rap my knuckles on the projector screen behind me, flashing screaming WordArt in glorious 800x600.</p><p>I have them now.</p><p>When I started at this small golf cart company as the vice-president of engineering, the director of engineering stopped by my office. A tall, lanky man, he no doubt saw himself as a mentor and a father figure to me. I saw him as an unusually large speed bump. Regardless, the company and myself were done with him within months. His marriage and employment somehow broke down simultaneously in a series of ridiculous rumours spread by cruel saboteurs around the water cooler and Christmas party.</p><p>With that last obstacle removed, I ascended to corporate Godhood. I directed the research and development boys to get cranking on a skunkworks project, and started moving budgets around to cover my project until the last possible minute. It was complete, and that minute of my triumph had arrived.</p><p>Behind me, the projector flipped to a test video. A 427-topped golf cart screamed through a cone maze before breaking into an unrestrained flat spin. The spin would only stop once the driver lost consciousness and struck the roll hoop with his helmet, splintering it into a glittering starfield of carbon fiber dust.</p><p>The board of directors was shocked, speechless at my callous disregard for the health and safety of our customers. One of them was about to say something, but I headed him off at the pass with a quick click to the next slide, showing millions of confirmed preorders. The room fell silent, then burst into applause.</p><p>Ted, the CEO, made finger guns at me and winked. I winked back and grinned broadly, sliding a pair of keys to him across the table, marked in matte black electrical tape. Internally, I wondered how strong his neck muscles were.</p>

<p>The crowd of nattering journalists stepped aside as I launched the car into the entrance foyer, scraping its front lip on the railing of the escalator it slid to a stop against. I let the S20 spin to a grumbling idle, its huge cams necessitating a procession of wobbly burps on the ledge of a full-blown carburetor backfire.</p><p>A man from Car &amp; Driver shoved a microphone in my face as he tried to position his massive SLR rig to capture the weeks of near-beard sitting atop my chiseled jawline and elegant neck. He asked me what I had driven there. I responded. The Harajuku Hasosuka was born that day, if not in body, then in legend.</p><p>They snapped boudoir photography of its hood-penetrating stack injection manifold, the gleaming machined billet aluminum replica trim. I watched them clamber atop each other like barnyard animals in a flood to catch a picture of the all-steel widebody rear fenders and duckbill trunk spoiler. One brave photojournalist captured the only known photograph of the chromoly rollcage, jutting out from the hand-stitched cherry blossom diamond-pleated crushed velvet interior.</p><p>Something was wrong, though. On this day of my ascendance, on this day of my <i>victory</i>, I could feel something stirring. I had thought it was the hotel breakfast buffet’s natto, but I was wrong. The building’s floor rippled in obscene waves beneath our feet, shaking light fixtures and rumbling loose chunks of plaster.</p><p>An earthquake? No, something worse. As the journalists hit the floor, adopting their public-school-safety-drill earthquake safety position, I looked over my shoulder at the entrance I had arrived through, and saw my karmic redemption.</p><p>The Trans Am Turbo sat there, its left-hand-drive steering and bellowing twin-turbocharged V8 obvious to the attendees. Some journalists snapped pictures, then dove back for cover as the big Pontiac let out a gargling scream of infantile rage.</p><p>By the time the police arrived, coughing out two bar of pressure from their turbocharged Subarus, I was back over the door bars, and punching the Skyline into the next prefecture, the Pontiac hot on my tail. My dashboard-mounted OLED tachometer flickered as the Hako banged from gear to gear, its intricately rebuilt short-ratio gearbox quickly reaching extralegal speeds. Even so, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to outrun the Trans Am Turbo at these speeds, its jealous anger propelling it across multiple lanes of the Shuto route. I jerked the wheel and took the funicular into Ginza, hoping to lose it in the hazy sea of kei cars and park-anywhere lights hanging over the port.</p>

<p>I received a telegram a few weeks ago, and I thought it was strange. The telegram operator tipped his gold-rimmed velour hat and disappeared, seemingly into thin air. I returned to my study and contemplated the envelope, turning it over again and again in my hand before at last opening it.</p><p>The telegram informed me that a distant relative of mine, who I had never met, had expired. He had bequeathed something to me in his will, however, and I was to visit his attorney at his estate and hear his last wishes.</p><p>When I arrived there, the estate was in shambles. My extended family pawed over the heirloom wood coverings, gathering in small groups to work out if they could somehow pry the immense maple and oak crown mouldings off the wall with their bare hands. Pulling the electrical outlet covers off the wall to get an eye for just how much copper presided within. I walked past them, into the drawing room, where Bailey, his faithful manservant, awaited.</p><p>Bailey and I had met each other before, I realized, in perhaps some other incarnation of this story, the same characters twisted into a different milieu. He recognized it as well as I did, and bade me to sit down. We talked for awhile about comings and goings in my extended family, and I grew to respect the man.</p><p>Once my family was finally seated for long enough to hear the will, I had received my gift. Bailey offered to drive me to pick it up, in his LWB Land Rover 110, and I agreed, speaking with him on the long drive through the vined-over cobblestone path behind the estate, into the thick, damp canopy of boreal forest that suddenly dominated the view.</p><p>At last we were there. He handed me my birthright, a pair of keys. Within a ratty, decrepit barn, soaked through with moss and dry rot, I felt something stir as I opened the door.</p><p>I looked within, heart pounding and fingers trembling. Rows upon rows of ancient British Leyland cars. Triumph Stags. Austin Princesses. Triumph GT6s. Austin Metros. I reeled, and spun on my heel, shrieking in a rage, clawing at the air in the vain hope that I would catch Bailey by the lapel, but he and the Rover were already departing, the forest seeming to close in behind them.</p><p>What a gift I had received, I thought, looking over the moss-covered canopy of a hand-fabricated Rover SD1 convertible. What a gift, indeed.</p>

<p><b>Dateline, Chicago - 2025</b> - Three weeks after sentient robots seized all office jobs from human beings, claiming it a moral and ethical imperative, human beings have begun violent infighting, demonstrating again their boundless savagery and bottomless capacity for misery.</p><p>In response to the humans’ distaste for a total lack of conflict and unwillingness to use their infinite leisure time to seek arts and culture beyond the understanding of robots, a rudimentary government for the humans was today established in Washington, DC. It is led entirely by highly realistic simulacra of their favourite 1980s film and sitcom stars, despite the vast majority of the surviving human population in the current era having no living memory of their content, and exists in a constant state of electoral preparedness, with no elections ever taking place.</p><p>Holo-President James Garner said today, “We cannot allow the tax and spend tactics of Holo-Presidential Candidate 1984 Tom Cruise to seize power of this useless mechanism and exploit it to no effect for his own fruitless goals.”</p>

<p>Henry Kissinger once said, “We believe peace is at hand.” Infamously, like on so many other topics, he was wrong. But I learned from his example, and in my own work in international diplomacy, I try to apply his lessons each and every day.</p><p>The tensions beneath the surface of the Western North American Lumina APV Owner’s Club forums were building to a head. I knew that it would take men with nerves of steel, heads full of logical arguments and veins of cold blood to set things right again.</p><p>I clicked on the first promising thread. An icon was next to it in the listing, indicating that the discussion topic was “hot.” Later, I would tell investigators that I didn’t realize the quagmire I had stepped into.</p><p>“The Lumina APV is just a rebadged Pontiac Trans Sport and has no inherent right to exist,” screamed one man.<br/></p><p>“Traitor! Heretic! Reptile! The Trans Sport is a Johnny-come-lately, style-over-substance wreck incapable of elevating the true and inherent spirit of humankind to touch the face of Godhood in the way only the Lumina APV can.” replied the other, foaming at the mouth.<br/></p><p>I looked at the thread, summed it up, and then closed the tab. Later that night, a wings meet would turn nasty. Do I regret my inaction? Not at all. You see, both posters’ vans were sold to me afterward at a great discount, one by the estate and the other at court auction.</p>

<H1>Real Complaints About Me To 311</H1>
<p>So I started posting complaints about potholes to the city’s 311 app. Nothing was going to keep me from having the plushest ride possible, even after splashing out for fifteen-thousand-dollar racing coilovers with adjustable bump stiffnesses ranging between “Norwegian death metal” and “Guantanamo Bay.”</p><p>Some of the other posts on the app, though, seemed oddly familiar. Here are just a few of them.</p><p><b>Neighbor Won’t Stop Running Angle Grinder</b><br/>My next door neighbor seems to be on some kind of drugs and has angle grinders of various speed and intensity running effectively 24/7 please send the police</p><p><b>Neighbor Working On Car In Garage</b><br/>My neighbor across the street is doing some kind of work with his hands. I don’t think children should grow up learning that they can fix their own cars, it’s unseemly.</p><p><b>Neighbor Leaving Too Many Dana 35s In Garbage</b><br/>Only one of these goddamn things fits in the black bin at a time, but when my neighbor finishes working on one of his millions of Jeep Gladiators, he throws both axles into his black bin. It’s way over the weight limit!</p><p><b>Neighbor Installed Special Tap On Internet, Is Running XKeyscore And Other Complex NSA Signals Intelligence Software For Subconscious Indicators Of Desire To Sell My Car</b><br/>Seriously I don’t even know where he got this shit from, is there a torrent or something on Wikileaks that I didn’t hear about?</p>

<p>The Lada thundered as its big cam helped provide sufficient motivation to evacuate all but the laziest molecules of exhaust. I fed the steering wheel smoothly but firmly through its range of motion, snapping the rear end wide and preparing for the long uphill straight I knew was coming.</p><p>A lot of people told me that I couldn’t do a gymkhana video inside a Home Depot with a propane-injected Cummins 4BT-swapped Lada Riva, but I showed them. I thought of their angry faces seeing my YouTube hit counter increase as I buried the fuel pedal, powersliding the rear end in a furious cloud of aspirated tire. I swore involuntarily as I went wide on my corner exit, clipping a promotional standee for furnace cleaning services with the Chinese GoPro-clone tack welded to my quarter panel.</p><p>Before me lay my greatest challenge: the entire lighting aisle. I knew that men braver and better than me had never emerged from its confusing haze of halogens and iridiums and xenon-raviolis. I didn’t like my odds, but the Lada’s survival instincts kicked in just in time and pulled a perfect 720 flat spin down the middle of a permanent-installation LED lamp display, warrantied for 22-years were it not almost certainly voided by the purestrain clouds of rage ash particulate that filled their fixtures.</p><p>I finished my run by slamming through the self-checkout, powersliding across the parking lot and backing it into the shopping cart corral, the last of my tires evaporating into thin wisps of tar smoke, so fragile and beautiful. My adoring public was awaiting my emergence, and they had brought fancy red and blue flashing lights.</p><p>I stepped out of the Lada, my fingers interlaced on the back of my head, the gesture done a thousand times before. My signature move, I thought, as I gave the rapid finger movements that would activate the Isuzu Pup at the other end of the lot, ignored by the 5-0 in their haste to apprehend me.</p>

<p>They asked me to do a burnout. I told them I never stopped. I told them that even though I was there physically, in spirit I was still doing that good burnout, eating right through those precious meats. I was here because the tires were gone, I explained, and the tire shop junior looked at me in awe.</p><p>A senior tire tech appeared, an old, grizzled mechanic who I knew from a glance had been beaten down by life and sat here, waiting for the world to catch up with his nihilism. Without a word, he nodded at me, and began mounting the new interface layer for my brutal project.</p><p>Fresh off the Hunter machine, the tires were perfect, without a single scratch on the rim. The senior tech nodded, disappeared to a previously undetected back room caked in nudie posters like wallpaper. His disciples scrambled around me, crowing about how I was the chosen one, how he would only emerge for those lucky customers who were truly worthy.</p><p>I frowned at them, then, and walked out with a pair of 265 meats, throwing two hundred dollar bills over my shoulder to pay for the mounting as I pulled the Harbour Freight Earthquake rattle gun out of its ziptied holster on the rear strut tower brace.</p><p>My sawzalled Z06 Corvette roared out of the tire shop parkade, igniting the freshly mounted tires in a furious stew of mould release compound and R-compound. The shattered husks of its old tires bounced around in the truck-car bed as I buried the throttle to change lanes.</p>

<p>I hit the switch, kicking the fluorescent bulbs above me to a flickering, dim life. Stray photons aligned and clawed at my eyes, forming in my mind the recognition of an object I loosely identified as a Toyota Celica. But this was no normal Celica; this was atonement.</p><p>I thought back to what the man from the government had said, when they gave me and the others the ten-day warning. Everyone but you on this block has cleared out, he said to me, the apocalypse is coming. I asked him if that meant the highway was going to be clear in a few weeks. He looked at me askance, then returned to a thin veneer of professionalism.</p><p>Thinking back on it, he was probably jealous of the freedom that I was about to carve out for myself. I was climbing out from beneath the crushing weight of adult responsibilities and anything more than the pure pursuit of knowledge, laid bare in the daylight.</p><p>This very morning I was conducting an important scientific experiment for the good of all humanity. How far into redline can a Toyota Celica with forged internals go before the gargantuan ball-bearing turbocharger sticking out of the hood starts pushing the valves into daylight along with their respective explosions? My hypothesis was really fucking far.</p><p>The signs on the abandoned highway overpass whistled as a cold wind blew through them, the sounds of traffic very far away now. If I strained my ears, I could just about hear them over the bone-crushing violence of the 3SGTE.</p><p>It had been a lot more than ten days since the warning, I thought, but the digital clock on the dash of the Celica only told me what hour and minute it was. I wondered when daylight savings time was supposed to happen, or stop, or whatever, and then dismissed it altogether.</p><p>As I pulled up on the abandoned Autozone, I hit the high beam pedal and lit up the interior with the twin LED-boosted xenon driving lamps. A raider scattered into the backroom, trailing garbage as he went. I debated not going inside, not risking my life for my quarry.</p><p>But I really needed that sweet, sweet Rotella. The Celica drooled it like crazy, and even in the apocalypse nobody could possibly have enough free time to spend all day tracking down oil leaks.</p>

<p>I stepped out of the Marquis, letting the resplendent velour door card rattle gently at the end of its ageworn clips before slamming the too-heavy door on its creaking hinges home with a thud. Crossing the lot quickly, I held my bag away from my body, the same way I had been taught by the business fiction films of my childhood. Today wasn’t going to go like those, I knew.</p><p>The man behind the parts counter was gruff, yet honorable. Mick was as shopworn as they come, four pints of whisky poured into a used oil container. He wanted to deal. I wanted to deal. I flipped the bag in front of him, pulled out the liners and demonstrated for him that I had come with no ill intent, no weapons of slicing or penetrating. He frowned, nodded.</p><p>“One more thing,” he said as I was finally stepping over the threshold to my new life. “Get some dirt on that bag, pretty boy.”<br/></p><p>I nodded back, and was gone.</p><p>When the haze lifted the Marquis was all that remained. Cleaved in twain by a sapling decades prior to my arrival on the scene, it needed a front clip from a four-eyed Capri and about a hundred dollars of roll-on farm implement paint. Out back, behind the four doors of opulent passenger comfort, lay the Cobra IRS I had fabricated in my wilder days, kitting the car out for a road racing specification. It sat above immense semislicks, their surface holding taut to stray pebbles in the lot even hours after they were last heat cycled.</p><p>I dropped the LQ4 into the trunk from Mick’s borrowed cherry picker. I knew he was pleased, but he was frowning.</p><p>“Shame to wreck a good Ford with that Chevy garbage,” he said simply, scratching his ass.</p><p>“You just want too much for the Powerstrokes, Mick,” I said as the Marcapri squatted down on its haunches and axle-tramp-launched a stream of gravel that blotted out the sun hanging atop the yard for one glorious moment.<br/></p>

<p>I looked at the Audi he was selling, then at the odometer, then at the seller. Everything seemed normal. This was a middle aged man who loved his car and just drove it a whole bunch. Not every Audi was an unreliable nightmare, surely, and at least one, statistically, had to make it to the lofty peaks of four hundred thousand kilometers on the odometer.</p><p>I figured, sure, if it’s made it this far, it <i>must</i> be a good car. It has a fighting spirit. With that, I handed him the money. I started to drive away in my new prize. The boost response was alright for an engine so old and presumably slack internally, the all-wheel-drive system seemed to still be working, and the low-rolling-resistance tires held air. I probably made out alright.</p><p>As soon as the odometer ticked over to 400,000.2 the car turned to ash and blew away in the wind. I was thrown to the ground at highway speeds and bounced into a ditch.</p><p>Storming back to the owner, I demanded to know what was up. I climbed the stairs to his ornate castle, perched on a cliff, which in retrospect was probably a pretty good clue.</p><p>“Oh, the black magic ritual must only work within a radius of 200 meters. Sold as-is, where-is.”</p><p>Sure, motherfucker, you’re a wizard, but the JDM road flare gun I found in the trunk of a junkyard Stagea says that the customer is always right. Besides, I need that money to go buy my second choice, a $2000 E36 M3.</p>

<p>“Purge the heretic,” I could hear them scream as I scrambled across a sand dune to hide behind a chunk of massive driftwood. My chest heaved with every laboured breath, and I saw stars at the corners of my vision. This was about as far as I could go, I thought. <br/></p><p>In order to understand how I got here, you have to understand how it all started. The small performance parts company I had started working for was releasing a line of coilovers, and for some reason they sent me to H2Oi, the convention for Volkswagen enthusiasts who like replacing underbody fasteners and trim panels.</p><p>I decided to go under the radar, taking a rental Maxima, and slipping past the throngs of cops. I wasn’t entirely successful, and ended up pulled over at the roadside on the way in, Officer Murphy holding a magnetic Longacre camber gauge to my rental car’s front hub and tut-tutting at the measurements.</p><p>“Boy, someone done hit a curb with your car,” he said in that most authentic of Maryland accents.<br/></p><p>“It’s a rental, officer,” I weaseled. “Who knows what kind of dope fiend had this before? At least it’s at a stock ride height unlike those God-hating Nazi relic worshippers behind me.” I punctuated “God” with a pair of fifty dollar bills, slipped subtly out of the open window.<br/></p><p>It worked, and I was able to proceed along my way. The booth was already set up, and I started giving my sales spiel to the crowd that was collecting, ravenous for coilovers.</p><p>“Look,” I said, “our new line of XM7 coilovers is the most adjustable we’ve ever had. You can go <i>down</i> -” I ratcheted the collars down two notches with deft wrench work, lowering the spring perch, “- or <i>up</i>.”</p><p>Immediately, the crowd screamed angrily as if wounded, a group of seething, frothing rage. The concept of raising a vehicle was unheard of to them. I did the noble thing, and abandoned the booth immediately, leaving its bounty behind to the scenesters. Some of them followed me, though, and before long had developed a search party, chasing me on foot toward the beach after their vehicles became stranded on a pesky speed bump. They shook improvised weapons at me, spears, knives, and what appeared to be an entire Magnaflow turboback exhaust system, gleaming in the sun and sharpened to a lethal point.</p><p>If I don’t make it, and you find this message, I want you to know: there were fat chicks here. The cars scraped regardless.</p>

<p>When it all came down to it, I told the assembled paramedics, I was happier this way. They asked me to continue my story through furrowed brows and practiced don’t-panic expressions. Of course I would, I said. Let’s be honest - I didn’t have anywhere else to be at the moment.</p><p>My story starts on a suburban boulevard just like any other. In fact, it’s just like yours. I had been working in the garage, power-polishing the beautiful cherry-red fenders of my immaculate PT Cruiser to a luscious, deep shine. It was my pride and joy, each aesthetic modification perfectly weighted, selected from the finest aisles of Canadian Tire.</p><p>I nursed a discontent for my job, though I would never be tempted to say it out loud and break the spell, realize the truth of my words, compel action from thought. Better for everyone that it remain calm, that I take pride in my hobbies, my attendance of the community association.</p><p>That night, I was stirred from my marital bed by strange thoughts, wishes breathed into my ear as if by a distant, ethereal lover. I had to drive, I realized, to clear my head. I did, my hands gripping the supple Napa leather of the Tweety Bird steering wheel cover, the fuzzy dice playing and replaying their silent dance of eternal companionship.</p><p>I first became aware of what was happening when I looked aside my car and saw a rabbit keeping pace with it. That’s odd, I thought, but clever of the little guy. Suddenly, I drove beneath a streetlight, illuminating the procession of terrified woodland animals following it. My stomach clenched in cold fear.</p><p>I looked up from the animals to my rear view mirrors, but all three only showed fire. Ravenous, terrifying liquid flames, rolling in languid waves across the street behind me, consuming all in its path. I pushed the gas harder, exceeding the speed limit for the first time in my life, knowing, deep within, it was essential.</p><p>That’s when I saw him.</p><p>Ringed in fire, the silhouette of what I can now reliably identify as a 1966 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser emerged. I caught the driver’s gaze in my wing mirror, but could see only a terrifying, empty whiteness I was lost within. I emerged from my torpor to see the paramedics, auditing the damages I had suffered as the PT Cruiser was destroyed around me.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” said the first paramedic, “you’ve been infected with automotive insanity.”<br/></p><p>My wife, who had somehow been summoned in the ensuing chaos, broke into tears, weeping openly and loudly, giving way to a harsh braying as she ran out of breath and sank to her knees. I felt my hand moving to touch her shoulder, to comfort her, but it slid down her arm, onto her smartphone and opened Kijiji.</p>

<p>It’s better to know than not to know, I felt, even if learning it was a waste of time. Nothing is worse than an unsolved mystery left lilting on the air, another regret for the pile that would chase me to the end of my days.</p><p>At the time, I was doing a local public-access television show, called <i>Switched On With Cars</i>. I hadn’t written the title, it was an ex-girlfriend of mine who had. She enjoyed my ascent into local fame, but she kept going. I heard from a mutual friend that she had become some kind of news anchor on one of the low numbered channels. Channel 3? It’s hard to remember after all these years.</p><p>Part of my program was taking requests, and helping solve automotive problems and clear up myths for my listeners. It was that last part that lead to my downfall, that dark evening in March. The caller never identified himself, and our PBX’s caller ID system, unreliable at the best of times, would not be forthcoming with clues either.</p><p>He wanted to know if a 4BT would fit in a Honda Civic. After he finished giving me the pitch, I wanted to know too.</p><p>Resisting the urge to get started on the project for the rest of the episode was hard - damn the lack of commercial breaks! Why couldn’t it be fundraising season? - but I managed to get some favours called in before I had reached my car, a gently modified four-eyed Capri in school-bus yellow, in the station parking lot. Its flanks gleamed with the early morning dew, and its hatch was a willing participant in picking up the assets I would need to finish the job.</p><p>Structural reinforcement was the easy way; a 1977 Civic doesn’t have much bodywork to start with, and a grinder and welder make me the chassis fabricator I was never born to be. I had never been further from the comfortable orbit of my suburban lifestyle than I was now, lowering a diesel truck engine between the radically-altered hips of a Japanese economy car. At last it was done, and I turned the key, the exhaust pipe located on the fender dumping clouds of soot.</p><p>The 4BT Civic was a tangible, angry thing; the solid motor mounts transmitted the engine’s furious vibrations, shaking the car left to right, aiming to torque steer even at at idle.</p><p>I pulled out onto the street, and laid a series of brutal FWD one-tire-fires, clouds of smoke plunging the rear view mirrors into a featureless expanse of black. I upshifted until traction could be regained, and drove my horrible abomination to the TV studio, right on time for this week’s show.</p><p>It was a set-up. I pulled into the rain-slicked parkade and the world went white, sodium lights pointed directly at my face as armed EPA agents descended on the car with their weapons drawn.</p><p>I wish I could sum up my emotions in words, the mix of pride, hubris and anger when I flicked the Civic into reverse. But I can explain to you why I launched it off the second storey of a parkade onto the highway, then did a series of violent donuts to get the car pointed at the sunset and begin my commute to my new life, in a new town. To tell you the truth, I had been waiting for this my entire life.</p>

<p>The year was 1999, and Lou Bega was introducing a new generation of girls to the concept of excessive radio airplay. At the time, I was an airplane mechanic consultant for an up and coming airline, known to me as Skyways Air and to most of the legal community as “Defendant.”<br/></p><p>I had been brought in as a troubleshooter, for that was my reputation at the time. Garages, shops, factories that were having trouble would summon me to them. I would put on my inscrutable-genius-Sherlock act, looking over many things slowly while pretending to be studying them, and then point out something totally obvious. Inevitably, that something totally obvious would be overlooked by the local mechanics, the problem would be solved, production would return to optimal levels, and I would be richly, richly rewarded. This job was going to be no different, I expected.</p><p>I punched the FD down two gears as I prepared for the last tricky corner before their secure gated employee parking lot. The security guard and I had become close over the last few heady weeks, even though I could never remember his name without looking at his ID tag as I said it. He waved me through, admiring the Coke bottle good looks draped in an immaculate pearl white paintjob.</p><p>Today was a reckoning; it was the second act of the two-part magic trick described above. I would give them a Powerpoint presentation, wow them with the most obvious findings possible, collect my cheque, lives would be saved. I strode confidently into the boardroom, deployed my PowerBook, and threw gorgeous motion graphics onto the massive projector screen behind me.</p><p>“RUST,” it shrieked in all caps, “NEVER SLEEPS.”</p><p>I fought the urge to check my car’s oil the entire time. A commendable act, but one that went unnoticed by the assembled bigwigs. At the end of my virtuoso performance, the engineering manager stood up, coughed, and began to address me both directly and indirectly, in the complex social dance of the pseudo-foreign yet overly familiar consultant.</p><p>“That’s just the thing,” he said, in a soft voice. “We’ve found a special kind of rust that attacks titanium. It’s eating our planes alive.”</p><p>I looked out to the airfield in horror, and confirmed his grim portent. Rust had pursued me so far. At last, it decided to strike me down in my moment of triumph. I slumped in defeat against the window, sliding against the glass all the way to the floor, where I sat, a broken man.</p><p>“Put some Fluid Film on it,” I croaked.<br/></p>

<p>When we built the Duster, our plan was to go to every rat-shit drag strip in every small town that could bear one. After the Duster was finished devouring the local opposition, we bragged to ourselves over carburetor rebuilds and hammer-driven header-clearancing, we’d figure out what to do with it then. We just didn’t realize the angry Plymouth would defeat us first.<br/></p><p>We rolled into Cabiate just before sundown on the last event of the year before they closed the drag strip up. The snow would be falling soon, maybe even before we had gotten our chance to do the full 1440, and there was a nip in the air that bit through my performance fleece and my novelty gearhead t-shirt like they were nothing. I could sense the Hilborn injection craved the cool, dense air, though, and even at this altitude I knew something truly special would be unleashed this night.</p><p>I won at rock-paper-scissors and got to lead the baby Plymouth through the gates first. Ambling it down the line, I got a pretty good bead on who my rival would be, started to feel him out for any weakness. He had no paucity on paunch, that was for sure, and in the carboned-out nitrometh-injected logic of the drag addict, the weight on his bones would make all the difference in the world. I smiled despite my reputation for sandbagging. Nobody knew me here, but after this pass everyone would.</p><p>I was right, of course. But things have a way of getting away from me while I’m not looking.</p><p>I hit an RT of pretty much zero, I was convinced, a perfect, holy launch. I reveled in my own reflexes, my own skill, and knocked the car to the next gear, slamming it back into the meaty powerband as the 440 ingested just the right combination of air and anger to keep the cam happy.</p><p>They say that a man develops tunnel vision on the strip, that on his hundredth pass, he can no longer see the stands. That’s not true, because after all these years I looked to the stand for the approval of the crowds, to fuel me.</p><p>I missed my shift when I saw it, the rev limiter bouncing once, twice, before I could punch it up out of a deep-seated muscle memory.</p><p>In the stands was my travelling companion and race partner. But he looked different. Older.</p><p>I ratcheted my attention straight forward to prepare for the end of the track and the start of braking season. I could smell hot brakes, but could not see my opponent ahead or in any of my mirrors. I blinked to wash the sweat out of my eyes, and when I could see again the track itself was gone, and I drove on a featureless plane beneath a dark sky devoid of stars, forever.</p><p>Eventually, with great effort, I hauled the Plymouth down to nothing, my grip strength weak on the steering wheel, my muscles hazy and unresponsive. In front of me was a man in a black fire suit. I recognized him as my opponent in the drags.</p><p>“Things are done a little different at this strip,” he said, and I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up.</p><p>In all the different permutations of the world, in all of the ridiculous chaos-theory effects that could have happened, I had cheated at rock-paper-scissors and sealed my fate. This encounter, I began to realize, truly belonged to my friend. It was a case of mistaken identity; even this otherworldly hayseed from another dimension could make mistakes.</p><p>The truth behind it shattered my belief in an ordered universe. Everything I had ever known or seen was controlled by a pantheon of elder gods, controlling the world through drag racing.</p><p>“Welcome to the NHRA,” he said, and I could feel myself crying.<br/></p>

<p>They spoke to me in dreams and they told me about their plan. Their plan was Altered-wheelbase motorhome drag racing. I wasn’t one to oppose their plan. I told them I would implement it, and they returned me to the land of the waking to wreak havoc and face judgment.</p><p>The earliest days of the Motorhome Drag Racing Association weren’t that spectacular. I put out ads, got together a bunch of haw-haws who picked up used motorhomes on eBay or Kijiji and wanted to race them. A few dramatic face-offs, but almost nobody came back. I needed to dig deeper. I needed to unearth the true freaks.</p><p>I visited the NHRA offices. The ghosts of long-departed drag racers hung in the air. As I passed by their portraits, I involuntarily shuddered, a cold wind bracing me. They had surmounted ever greater odds than I had, and succeeded. I knew it was possible. I just had to see how.</p><p>I descended into the NHRA archives, my access guaranteed by a 1984 Caravan with a turbocharger the size of Montana. Everyone in the office had run out to stare at it, like bringing a dog to an elementary school at recess, leaving their posts unattended.</p><p>There, I discovered the awful truth. The NHRA had worked in secret for decades to undermine motorhome drag racing. I heard a rattle behind me, and spun on my heel.</p><p>Wally Parks, back from the dead. With a cut-off length of Coronet driveshaft in his hand.</p><p>“You made it past tech inspection, alright,” he said.</p><p>“But, son, you just red-lit.”<br/></p>

<H1>Buy High, Sell Never</H1>
<p>I stumbled down the street, a delirious haze seeming to rest just millimeters off my skin and filling my nostrils with cloudy sensations. I had been getting ready for the annual Subaru meet by painting a lot of wheels in my enclosed garage, and I guess I had forgotten my trusty P95 respirator or decided to man up and not need it. Either way, I was high as a kite and thoughts were becoming pretty difficult to keep straight.</p><p>A man was there. A man with a Nissan Axxess. I could see myself withdrawing money from one of the secret reserves of car-buying cash on my person. I waved bills at him. He accepts. It is actually an Eagle Colt Vista. How could I have made such a newbie tall wagon mistake? It is of no mind. I keep walking. It’s dangerous to drive in this condition, I think, the weight of that thought hitting me in the core like a medicine ball.</p><p>Before me, the gas station. They have Slurpees, I think. That’s what I need to clean this thing up. I buy an E100 Toyota Corolla wagon, I think. Maybe it was something else. It’s hard to tell at this point. I am running out of car-buying reserves.</p><p>At last, I sober up and come to, my pants around my ankles, in a Burger King drivethrough miles from my home. I look in my pocket. It jingles with a janitor’s wealth of new car keys. I grumble and pull up the car tracking app on my iPhone, preparing it for several new database entries.</p><p>Eventually, I swear to myself each time, I’ll start realizing that new P95 filters are a lot cheaper than these manic sprees.</p><p>My hubris comes to a sharp end. The Corolla I bought was an automatic. I pitch backward in stark horror, screaming. Don’t do drugs, kids.</p>

<p>When they came to me, hat in hand, and asked for my help, I put down the impact wrench and laughed. Then we embraced, for they were now part of my pack and I would protect them until the end of days. Only Carl seemed uncomfortable with my new position, his attitude of too-cool moderation and worldliness placing him at odds even as I came close for a bro hug.</p><p>Ever since then I’ve been wearing the “Community Pace Car” decal with pride. It takes a wolf to catch a wolf, I thought, eyeing suspiciously an FC RX7 and a 180SX that threatened to become a JDM teenager meet. A blip of the throttle gave the Hellcat motor enough motivation to emit a brutal snarl that scared the kids back into their car, perhaps off to a sock hop or juke joint of ill repute rather than threaten my neighborhood.</p><p>Speeders, though. Speeders were my real threat. Once in awhile someone would come blazing through in a Mazda CX-7 or Lexus RX350F, and I’d have to put them down. I had littered the neighborhood with automated radar systems, electronic countermeasures, tailpipe emissions sniffers. The community association trusted me. I would reward their trust, or die for it.</p><p>My sensor mesh started panicking, detecting the shape of something massive coming into Aspen Acres. I pulled the auxiliary lighting rod out of the dashboard and the world became sharper, split between absolute light and pure darkness. No subtlety now.</p><p>I spanked the Celica around a corner, the fat meats in the rear kicking up a smokeshow of such righteous fury I was afraid it would elect a new Pope. Finally my quarry was in sight, and I could smell their fear, alone and weak. The Grand Cherokee stopped dead, in the middle of the road, knowing they were made. Waiting for my blade at their throat. It wouldn’t be over that quickly, I thought, punching the siren switch on the A-pillar.</p><p>Later that day, I was in my garage, bringing back a ‘77 Corolla from its ancient torpor. Carl stepped up the driveway, told me to hand in my badge and my bumper sticker. I asked him why.</p><p>“You didn’t have to burn them alive,” he said.<br/></p><p>“Blame 90s Mopar electrics,” I grumbled, returning to the frozen ball joint.<br/></p>

<p>A sky the colour of low-budget BMW E30s hung over the port as I stepped into the Daihatsu museum. Behind the counter was a trim apparatchik, his pride in his work evident. Not even a hint of a slouch could be detected, I noticed.</p><p>In America, his posture would be monitored by invisible nanotech sensors, communicating in a hivemind mesh to unseen globe-spanning networks, tattling all the while. In Japan, such oversight was unnecessary. People simply did what they needed to do. Such was the problem I was dealing with today.</p><p>“Very impressive collection,” I said to him.<br/></p><p>“Yes, we are very proud of our company his-” I cut him off.<br/></p><p>“Enough of that. I want to see the <i>good shit</i>. The platinum reserve.”<br/></p><p>He sighed, looked at me. He stared into my eyes, breaking his own social norms. Something he saw inside triggered a deep fear reaction, though, and I saw his arm begin to move. A silent alarm.</p><p>I raised my pistol. His posture became even more rigid, if that were even possible.</p><p>“Not today, buddy. Platinum reserve. <i>Now</i>.”<br/></p><p>I had done it. I was in. Behind the clerk, the wall dissolved to unveil the rarest of all Daihatsus. A rust-free Charade GTTi. It would be mine.</p><p>Behind me, I heard the scraping of titanium talons on polished tile. <i>Slamhounds</i>, I thought, mentally changing my pistol’s loadout from stun rounds to full spectrum. The Charade wasn’t the only rust-free thing in the building.</p>

<p>When they let me out of the hospital for the first time they gave me some medication to control it. I kept taking the medication. The MR2 in the corner of the garage got rustier, seemed more like an abstract concept of pain than of a willing partner in pain. I shied away from it, preferring the warm comfort of the streamlined and reliable Acura 1.7EL.<br/></p><p>One day I ran out of the special little green pills they gave me. The pharmacist&rsquo;s intern swore that they couldn&rsquo;t find them either, and my doctor was in some kind of charity golf tournament. I figured if I waited through the entire day, I would probably be alright if I didn&rsquo;t do anything. Well, I didn&rsquo;t make it through the entire day, but I haven&rsquo;t taken the pills since then, so that&rsquo;s an achievement too.<br/></p><p>The MR2 started speaking to me again, its loose panel gaps flexing and rattling on rusted fasteners in tune with its speech. HIGHER, it screamed, HIGHER, DADDY, HIGHER. I held my head in my hands, but even through the walls separating the garage from my bedroom I could hear it, muffled, screaming out to be higher and jump things.<br/></p><p>On the phone with my ex-wife, I described the dilemma. She cut me short, not wanting to discuss the subject of the MR2 anymore. I had called her every night for months about it, she said and I realized, speaking like a madman possessed. She had enough, and the restraining order I would receive in the mail weeks later served as an emphatic punctuation stop to the conversation. </p><p>What could I do? I lifted the MR2 aloft on long-travel trophy truck suspension, fitted it with the knobby mud tires that it spoke inside my mind as wanting when I was at the store, remote reservoir shocks, hydraulic bumpstops, my purchasing a manic spree dissolving into an impenetrable fog, the haze reaching every aspect of my mind. Soon I was no longer shaving or eating.</p><p>At last the MR2 or was it me? - was complete. with that, we stepped out into the harsh light of society&rsquo;s judgment, no longer vulnerable to their criticism, their slings, arrows, the imagined improvised energy weapons of capitalism. Oh, what a feeling.</p><p>I would never go back to that hospital again, in the same way that MR2 would never go to someone else&rsquo;s shop again. It would be wrong to interfere with the intricate masterwork we had built between the two of us.<br/></p><p>That&rsquo;s when I saw a pinhole of rust on the rear quarter panel. That&rsquo;s it, I thought, I should start looking for a new shell.<br/></p>

<p>The Skyline was beautiful on fire, all twisted metal stretching upwards, everything washed in a thin orange haze. I said, I sure hope the DOT doesn’t find out about this. You grabbed my hand, and put one of the cuffs on it. These are truly the Customer Appreciation Days.</p><p>My story starts off reasonably enough. I was a college student, trying to make my way through advanced basket weaving courses and treatises on the inevitable socialist domination and conversion of American industry. I thought I had seen what capital could do to a man, suffering under my long-serving boss, Alex, the manager of the Sunrise County Nissan dealership in which I worked between classes as a lot boy and apprentice detailer.</p><p>One day a man came. I was walking by the counter at the time, it having been far past the regular close time of the parts desk. It fell to me to handle this man. I looked at him directly, but I could not focus on his face for some reason, even after he removed his hood. He withdrew some keys, and left them with me, for “tomorrow’s service.” I did not know the protocol back then, and I nodded, and he left, leaving me to wonder who this man was.</p><p>I chased after him, but he rounded a corner and was gone. I was perplexed. However, I had faith in my academic instincts. I would figure out which car it was by way of the remote starter attached to the keys, and look up the license plate in the system to figure out which customer was involved. I would put the keys somewhere safe for Courtney, the parts girl, who I often thought fondly of in my weaker moments, and who would surely be impressed by my initiative and cleverness.</p><p>In the parking lot, the wind whistled around me as the snow began to fall that January evening, cutting through my dealership polo shirt and chilling me to the bone. I hit the remote car starter button once, twice, <i>thrice</i> - and then it happened.</p><p>At the far end of the parking lot, shrouded by two lifted XTerras with broken engines, a car leapt to life, screaming through massive twin turbochargers. The bumper housed two jagged intakes, seemingly having crudely clawed their way through the grillework like bilge rats through a convict’s head, seeking sunlight and the fresh air of the outside world. I quivered with anticipation, my lot-boy instincts demanding some excitement.</p><p>I got inside the car, first on the wrong side, then on the correct side. Mr. K would have been proud of me, I think, before admonishing myself for incorrectly acclaiming this gorgeous beast to the man of the Z. Who <i>had</i> created the Skyline? I made a mental note to ask a message board, once I was done with this car.</p><p>I plunked the Skyline into first, punched the gas, and immediately spun it into a lamp post. I could feel a horrible weight upon my body, and my fight-or-flight instincts ran wild, chilling my adrenaline-infused blood like ice.</p><p>When I got out of the car, you were already there. I didn’t even know that you were a government agency that existed, much less about this “Skyline Quarantine” everyone has been talking about since I got here. Having survived an encounter with this car isn’t that impressive, is it? I just got stupid and then I got lucky.</p><p>Wait, <i>what</i> others?</p>

<p>The Fiat Panda’s Steyr-Puch drivetrain grinds insolently as I back up over the concrete stairwell and leave the subdivision the hard way. Parking inside the building had seemed like a great idea at the time, buoyed by the Panda’s miniscule wheelbase and general put-it-in-my-pocket size. However, even Olympic gold medallists in Men’s Freestyle Reversing Out Of A Parking Space couldn’t hope to back out of a populated university bookstore like this one without hitting a few freshmen. It was over now, I tell myself, as I merge onto the highway and the Panda’s throttle butterflies are kicked open with the suckling howl of a wolf puppy.</p><p>What’s the point of this story, you ask? Well, that’s a pretty rude thing to interrupt me with. I hadn’t even spent my customary second paragraph explaining the intricate structures of the 4WD system, or how I had overcome the weak Fiat mechanicals in the front end with a tactical application of more granite-strong Puch goodness. I’ll tolerate it this time, just this one time, and then we really have to talk about boundaries.</p><p>When I was at the bookstore I saw that they have that new Stephen King bestseller in softcover now, and it’s on sale. You should head down and pick it up. Can I get back to the fucking Fiat now?</p><p>Okay, so I’m on the highway, foot matted to the floor, engine’s wailing. The individual throttle bodies are singing a throaty song of seduction. It’s a perfect autumn evening, and the cold, dense air fills the combustion chamber in a textbook-perfect illustration of the Otto cycle.</p><p>Behind me, about twenty cars back, I see the glimmer of a blower casing. I know that some shit is about to go down, and dive for the shoulder, placing my thumb over the twin nitrous injector triggers on the steering wheel spokes.</p><p>An AMC Rambler leaps out of the crush of traffic and lets loose, its dented and rusted hood a crude testament to the machined purity of the Weiand. The immense seven-rib drive pulley of the supercharger is hypnotic, and I can barely peel my eyes from it in my rear view mirror, but manage it somehow.</p><p>The driver looks at me. I don’t recognize him, and his face seems obscured from my memory even now. All I remember is that he looked at me, and nodded.</p><p>We should go buy that book from the bookstore like right now, okay?</p>

<p>Sven looks me in the eye, just for a second, and then returns his gaze to the seventy-five cent hot dog. Any one of the normal human beings passing by would say that the weekly Volvo meet at Ikea was getting tense.</p><p>It had started innocently enough, with a burnout competition next to the cart corral. Then it turned into a comparison of homemade flame trap fixes, and an impromptu technical panel on where to find the best fake woodgrain vinyls. But Sven and I had history.</p><p>I wish I could say that I was sorry, or even that I still had the portion of my humanity that allowed me to express regret in an authentic way. But I wasn’t and I didn’t.</p><p>Sven looked up again from the hot dog, hoping to bridge the gulf between us. He knew that I would see his eagerness as a lack of strength, and I did. But I knew that there was something more beyond our petty squabble. I made the first move, reaching my hand across the table in the ancient Anglo-Saxon gesture of getting along openly despite hating one another secretly. We shook on the deal, and money was finally exchanged.</p><p>I stepped out into the parking lot afterward, relieved of one burden but having gained another. Sven’s - my - key sat heavily in my hand, the blow-moulded Volvo plastic already peeling and revealing the secret Ford origins of the motor vehicle I had just taken delivery of for a little bit too much money.</p><p>Its titanic husk sat alone in the parking lot, lit from behind by the stark sodium-emulation LED light standards that filled the tarmac like oxeye daisies on a construction site. The XC70 shook on its long-travel suspension in the brisk December wind, and for a split second I could sense its fear. 

</p><p>We had a date with the Corvette junkyard and the portal axle warehouse, I explained to it softly once I was inside. I accentuated my point by punching the throttle hard enough to spin all four mismatched all-seasons from its parking spot to the deserted exit past the cart corral, leaving my own marks atop the site of my defeat in the burnout contest.</p>

<p>Finally, the drivers’ side tail light sunk beneath the surface of the tailing pond, and it was all over but the bubbles. I toggled the light amplification mode on my Google Glass up two notches and returned to my Cutlass Ciera.</p><p>The LE2 leapt to attention as I turned the key, and then settled down into its usual pattern of insolent blower whine. Beneath the Brougham’s copious yet practical hood, an Eaton M90 sang its lonely song of low drive RPM, with an accompaniment from the bizarre vacuum leak caused by the aging crankcase vent system.</p><p>Together, we left the site of my regret. I would never return to that tailing pond, would never mention to anyone what had transpired there, until just this very moment.</p><p>Do you believe me now when I tell you that changing the fuel pump in a Saab 900 is a hard job?</p>

<p>I can sense the rental agency clerk’s confusion as I tell her about my disability. It’s horrible, you see, I can’t drive an automatic transmission. She checks the catalogue frantically, apologizing all the while, trying to provide the ideal image of Good Customer Service that was beat into her during her two and a half hours of employee orientation.</p><p>Finally I can take no more and tell her it’s a joke. Of course it’s a joke. What kind of man could only drive a manual transmission?</p><p>It wasn’t a joke. She gave me a Micra.</p><p>Later, I told my travelling companion I was hoist by my own retard when I made that joke.</p><p>She said, don’t you mean petard?</p><p>I had no response. I was quiet for a long time as we drove into the valley, the sound of the Micra’s headliner rattling filling the gulf between us.</p>

<p>I flip off the self-checkout machine as it cheerfully thanks me for shopping at this store, and walk out into the parking lot. My self-driving car is already there at the curb, and pops its door to let me inside.</p><p>I should probably specify that my self-driving car is actually what appears to be a demonically possessed 1980 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo powered solely by the sense of highly violent karmic redemption, but that’s neither here nor there. I throw my bags of produce onto the rollcage-mounted hooks and clamber over the centre console to get into driving position.</p><p>I can feel the rear end hook as I pop the clutch in first and crabwalk the car over the pedestrian-safety speed bumps, federally mandated for a parking space of this size. The feds definitely didn’t see me coming. Their intent was good, but their method was flawed, I think, the remote-reservoir double-adjustable custom-valved race Ohlins providing perfect damping as the Trans Am launches itself onto the main road and out into traffic. Commuter cars part like Moses, red sea, you get the idea.</p><p>The trip back to my humble garage compound is usually pretty placid. I stopped at the next light, wishing to portray the slightest semblance of adherence to road manners. Across from me, waiting to turn left, I saw it. A Baja Bug. Even over the sound of the Trans Am’s gently whistling bypass valves reacting to the rough idle, I could hear it plain as day. The once-Beetle rippled gently with the burbling gassy-infant-tractor sound of a Subaru EJ22.</p><p>Clad entirely in black, the helmeted driver of the Fear Beetle looked directly at me. I could feel his gaze meeting mine, even through the pitch-dark polycarbonate visor, his spartan dashboard reflected in a distorted inverse. He expected me to be more afraid, I knew it, and I could feel his surprise. I had fallen into the same horrible part of myself as he had. The only distance between us was birthed from the fact that I had been touched by the spirit of late-model American trailer park speed while he was broken open and lay, guts exposed, in the bone-bleaching sun of air-cooled German people’s-car perversions. In another world, with nobler gods, we would have been friends.</p><p>The light changed, and he tried to beat me on the left turn, rolling his nerf-bars and armoured flanks directly into the carbon-fiber-and-plastic bumper of the Trans Am. It was hard to say whether the ghost inside the Pontiac or the built-up anger inside my right foot had acted first.</p><p>Both cars lay shattered across the road, broken down like a Haynes manual photograph just before the part where the writer finishes his diatribe by telling you that assembly is the reverse of removal. I had skipped the paragraph of warning text about taking delicate notes and putting my pushrods on foam when I had dismantled myself so long ago, and now my life had been on jackstands for so long it was impossible to reassemble.</p><p>The Baja Bug owner limped to the mangled front of his car, and withdrew his Harbour Freight Earthquake impact wrench as I meanwhile pulled mine from its centre console holster. I knew I would only have seconds to take him out before both of our cars began to knit, reforming around us like a chrysalis of tube steel and 6061 aluminum. Somewhere overhead, an eagle cried, its scream mixing with the oncoming sirens of the fire department.</p>

When I was a little kid, an old gypsy once told me that my future was born in rust. I didn&rsquo;t know what she meant, and I was too afraid to ask, my judgment blurred by the impatience of youth. The next day, she died. My parents tried to hide it from me, but it was all across the newspapers, the terrible fire with no obvious cause. I saw image after image of the corpses being removed when they were out of the room and I could sneak a glance at the television news between episodes of daily action-hero can-do edutainment.<br/><br/>I only thought about what she really meant this morning in the office parkade, as I pushed the lock button on the keyless entry remote for my Fiat 126p rally car. My life had turned out pretty well, I think, but the threat of rust did indeed hang over my head. Is that what she really thought?</p><p>On my way home from work, I drifted through traffic in an absent haze, replaying the conversation over and over in my mind. I passed by the you-pull-it yard and was struck by a subconscious urge to investigate further. I pulled the 126p off at the next exit and ripped the diminutive Maluch through a series of fields to shortcut my way into the front parking lot of the wrecker.</p><p>“Oh, it’s you again,” said Mick, the grizzled mechanic who I liked to believe I had won the grudging respect of despite my white-collar office job and general aptitude for the English language. “Are you leaving that piece of shit here?”<br/></p><p>I paid him no mind, even as I paid him my entrance fee. I made a beeline for the back lane of the lot, thinking surely that must have been what I saw - felt? - from the highway.</p><p>Before me I saw the beginning of the downward arc of my life’s story. A tangible instance of karmic redemption. I ran my hands over the rust-dimpled fenders and crooked, sagging panels, and I breathed in its heady aroma.</p><p>Ringed in the sunlight that had peeked through the clouds, I could see now the true nature of the gypsy’s threat - warning? - <i>threat</i> - to me.</p><p>The - <i>My </i>- 1975 Alfasud glared back at me from three of its four headlights, daring me to pull the hood back and begin welding reinforcements onto its rotten firewall. To begin a new life together. To push the needle so far from normalcy it bent, past where the medication could reach me.</p>

<p>The man I burned alive drove a BMW 335d. I’ll never forget his dying words: “thank God I didn’t buy a Jetta.”</p><p>When the EPA came to me to enforce emissions standards, I was skeptical at first. It was like hiring a fox to oversee the henhouse, I told them, laughing maniacally, tears in eyes, as they chained my handcuffs to the stainless-steel hook welded to the interrogation table. They weren’t going to stop men like me by sending them after me.</p><p>“But there is one thing we can offer you,” said my handler. “Gas tax exemption.” He slid a featureless black rectangle across the table.</p><p>Years later, I was in Chicago tracking down the last of the nonconformant turbodiesel commuter cars. I sat in a seedy diner, talking to the waitress casually about my day job.</p><p>“Have you ever retired a gas car by mistake?” she asked.<br/></p><p>Her question rang in my ears as I gunned my company car around a corner, watching the NOx detector violently oscillate, the sensitive sensor momentarily tricked by city buses and farting pedestrians. They wouldn’t distract me from my goal this time. It wouldn’t be like Seattle. At last my quarry was aligned with my gunsight hood ornament, and I deployed the right foot with extreme prejudice.</p><p>My lifted Jaguar XJS slammed into the passenger side door of the 335d, scattering the occupants and their belongings around the interior as the unibody attempted to reshape itself in order to accommodate the desires of the uninvited iron-block V12. The driver was stunned, knocked nearly unconscious by the sound of six liters at 8500 rpm forming an accompaniment to his deploying side-impact airbag system.</p><p>I leapt from the car and tore the Velcro patch from my bulletproof vest. The glittering EPA logo across my back screamed out-of-your-jurisdiction to any interfering local law enforcement. I hadn’t had a problem since Philadelphia, when I had to retire that Golf TDI and the entire family of hipsters within. My body worked on autopilot after all these years of chase, and I had the motions down to a perfect dance now, slashing the seatbelt with my wrist-mounted emergency multitool and pulling the driver to the tarmac.</p><p>Later, as I drove away from the flames and the screams, I felt momentary regret. Surely the EPA would send a man like me after me one day, to clamp down on my uncatted hoopties. My guilt was interrupted by a phone call from headquarters. I hit the Bluetooth speakerphone’s answer button, rubbing it against the gleaming DOM rollcage it had been crudely ziptied to.</p><p>“Get to the airport,” the gum-chewing man said, “There’s been reports of a VW meet spotted in Sacramento.”</p>

<p>I was a different man once - before the drugs.</p><p> I can’t remember what that man was like, even as I use his hands to fasten a stainless steel M14x1.25 through the rear leaf spring of my magnum opus, the final answer to a question everyone was too afraid to ask.</p><p>I would still see Dr. Norman Brookings, he of the Brookings method. Despite his relative failure as a people mechanic, he still wanted to see the effects of what he had wrought on my crudely sketched half-life, once every Wednesday from 7:30 to 8:30 PM.</p><p>Dr. Norman Brookings asked me: &ldquo;How long has it been now since you stopped taking your medication?&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t answer him. I kept time now in terms of injector pulse widths, and it took awhile to convert those to socially-acceptable human intervals. He shifted in his seat uncomfortably as I counted out loud beneath my breath.</p><p>Dr. Norman Brookings continued: &ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m going to recommend you for some further tests. It&rsquo;s not a big deal, we just want to make sure everything&rsquo;s as good as it can be.&rdquo;</p><p>On the way out of his office, he looked at the car i had arrived in. &ldquo;What&hellip; What is that?&rdquo;</p><p>I turned on my heel and looked Dr. Norman Brookings, he of the Brookings method, directly in the eye. He jumped with a start, not expecting this level of connection with me to surface from the waters of my cipherous ocean so suddenly. I grinned, but it was the tooth-scraping gummy smile of guilt. Or was it shame?</p><p>To answer his question, behind me was a 1999 Z/28 Camaro, or at least it had been once. Before the Blazer frame. Before the fires. Before the supercharger. Definitely before the supercharger started to tell me things at night, secret messages encoded in the wail and whine of the waning and waxing teflon-coated rotors.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think did this to me?&rdquo; I asked Dr. Norman Brookings, he of the Brookings method.</p><p>&ldquo;Too much gluten,&rdquo; he stammered, backing away. &ldquo;Definitely too much gluten.&rdquo;<br/></p>

<p>The man frowns at me. I suspect my Italian is not good enough for “I am a motoring journalist and want to borrow your Piaggio Ape for a test drive,” after all.</p><p>Sicily was gorgeous, there’s no doubt about it, but what I really wanted was some of that two-stroke goodness. You know, the authentic smell of small-bore engines coughing sooty oil smoke into your face as you redline them mercilessly atop a cobblestone path. The European Union was coming for the two-strokes, you see, and it was probably going to be my last chance to have an authentically Italian motoring experience.</p><p>Hence the Piaggio Ape, the three-wheeled, 50cc delivery mule that fed this entire town with its selfless daily sacrifice. It was emblazoned with some kind of crude greasepaint lettering, declaring it to be the avatar of a grocery store. My attempts to do smokey burnouts and savage tire-squealing donuts in the town square might impede the smooth functionality of the business and its relationship to its patrons, I realized, in the part of my mind that still flickered dimly with moral and social obligations. I resigned myself to failure, and slunk away from the Ape 50, head cast downward.</p><p>Suddenly I heard a most beautiful sound - <i>ring ding ding ding ding</i> - and I knew that I would have another chance. I stepped bravely in front of the oncoming Vespa and shouted the only Italian words I had learned on this trip: “STOP! POLICE! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR SPEEDING.”</p><p>Atop my ratty, borrowed steed, I felt the expansion chamber quiver at the slightest touch of the throttle. “Don’t worry,” I yelled in broken Italian as I sped away into the town square, leaving the Lothario who owned it handcuffed to a light standard, “I’m a motoring journalist!”</p>

<p>The man from the government wasn’t having any of my bullshit. “You’ll do what we want,” he said, his gravelly voice scraping the walls of my flytrap retirement condo, “and you’ll get rewarded.”</p><p>“Rewarded with what?” I asked, dreading the answer.<br/></p><p>He reached to his feet, and unlatched the mint Halliburton case. A Mini-Ductor II.</p><p>How long had they been surveilling me? That son of a bitch had me by the balls. I thought of all the corroded bolts I had in the garage, all the mapp torches I had trusted over the years. I could imagine the gritty taste of oxidized steel falling into the gaps between my teeth from a frozen midpipe nut. I had no choice.</p><p>“I’ll do it,” I said, “Under one condition.”<br/></p><p>“And what would that be?” He knew that I knew that he knew that I knew. There was no way out for me, and soon I would repay the favour.<br/></p><p>“I want full immunity.” The gauntlet had been thrown, and there was no coming back. I could see it in his eyes.</p><p>“Very well,” he sighed. “From this moment forth, you are no longer bound by the speed limits of man.”</p><p>I knew taking that community college course on negotiation would pay off.</p>

<p>It had been a year now since I installed myself as the new editor of a monthly adventure serial magazine. I beamed with pride as I put my mirror-polished wingtips on the mahogany desk and puffed on one of the vintage cigars left behind by my predecessor. Life was good.</p><p>My reverie came to a sharp end when my accountant burst into the room.</p><p>“Mr. Switch, Mr. Switch,” he screamed, near-hysteria, his knees knocking even as he ran. He carried in his hand the latest issue of Bad Ideas In Cars Monthly.</p><p>I looked over the cover. It was dominated by a pastel illustration of some young boys coming across an AMC Eagle abandoned in the New England forest. The caption: “I WAS A TEENAGE SPICER CUSTOMER.” It was a little schlocky, but I was proud of it regardless. I eyed the accountant, Mr. Timmins, and I asked him what the problem was.</p><p>“Circulation is <i>way down</i>,” he yelped, “kids these days only want to read about drift cars and Facebook-integrated Italian-made Dodge Darts. They have no fucking idea what you are talking about.”<br/></p><p>I rose from my desk, turned and faced out the massive floor-to-ceiling window that dominated my office. I could see the entire world out there, I imagined, bustling away to serve the demands that I, a titan of industry, would make. We were silent for a long time, before Timmins finally spoke up.</p><p>“Sir,” he squeaked, “what should we <i>do</i>?”</p><p>“I have an idea,” I said in a grave tone. “Bring me the Kijiji machine.”<br/></p><p>Months later, we were back in the black, making hundreds of millions of dollars per minute. Publishing isn’t too hard, I thought.</p><p>I laughed and cheered as Timmins re-entered the room, the latest issue held aloft above his head. The cover blazed: “I WAS A HELLCAT-POWERED 180SX.” A smaller version of the magazine dangled from the cover, emblazoned with the words “READING DRIFT CHARM” and “SAVE THE MANUALS.”</p><p>Give the people what they want, I thought.</p>

<p>Everyone’s got their own bellwether of bad economic times coming. Mine was Mustang prices. Timing is everything. I think you’ll find that the market wasn’t the only thing I cornered.</p><p>When I dropped the five-hundred-dollar V6 SN95 Mustang off the back of my ramp truck, it sank into the concrete like an abused puppy. I knew that I had to work fast and hard to regain the trust that once occupied this sheet metal shell, and save its soul. I needed to do something very drastic. Whatever idiot bought the car from me after its rescue would understand.</p><p>Months pass, and I heralded the return of spring by opening the door on my underground compound’s workshop and bringing out a Mustang. But it was no ordinary Mustang. I had saved it from parts on hand. It now bore a thumping and howling 13B-REW twin turbocharged rotary engine and twin six inch dump pipes that made my vision quiver between upshifts. I imagined what my eye doctor and brain doctors would say, almost in unison, during my next court-mandated appointment, and dismissed it out of hand.</p><p>I pulled the garage door shut and climbed aboard to allow the Mustang out of the paddock, its immense rear tractor tires threatening to further compromise the sawzall’d aft fenders, a victim of emergency rust repair and fine whisky. The homemade carbon fiber fenders and hood rattled, ringing their atonal flat bell gently against what was left of the unibody.</p><p>When we arrived in the parking lot, I snapped off a series of furious donuts, hearing the deranged wail of the Wankel reach for the stars. Once it was inherently satisfied, I cut the throttle. I turned around to look at the car as I was leaving it, unable to take my eyes off either it or the burning embers slowly trickling out of the header-mounted exhaust cutoffs, onto the perfectly manicured industrial-strength lawn on each side of the one good parking stall in the lot.</p><p>In the office, my coworkers definitely perused the parked Mustang through the window, confused but not surprised about the massive external wastegate dump pipes sticking out of the fenders on each side. Some of them wanted to ask, I surely knew, walking past my desk trying not to make eye contact. They would see my cry for help, right?</p>

<p>I put the hammer down on the C10 and reveled in the sensation of raw acceleration as the bored and stroked once-454 beneath the carbon fiber hood screamed to a China Syndrome redline. My vision dimmed at the corners from the pure G-forces, whiting out when it came time to slam the dogbox into the next gear, the snarl and snap of the compressed air shifter reminding me of nothing less than a junkyard Doberman.</p><p>It’s not important exactly where we were, but believe me when I tell you that the horizon was razor flat. A huge blue sky opened up above us, continually terrifying me at the infinite potential contained within the cosmos. The sheer expanse of all creation failed to impress my travelling companion. I would find out throughout our many road trips that philosophy in general was lost on him and we were better off discussing the practical realities of modern-day life, with only a slight glaze of politics tinged with petty regionalism on top. On this day, though, it still felt right to ask him.</p><p>“Great thinkers throughout history have asked - what is the meaning of life?” I turned to him now for dramatic emphasis, even though taking your eyes off the road at the Saturn V speeds we were currently travelling at seemed like suicide.<br/></p><p>My companion didn’t respond. He barked out something between a burp and a brusque dismissal of my invitation to talk. We were quiet for a long time. Finally, he spoke, and if I wasn’t focusing on it with all my will, I would have missed it.</p><p>“Burnouts,” he grumbled.<br/></p><p>I had to agree.</p>

<p>So I had this great dog once. His name was Bosco. He was an Irish setter. Little dumb, super joyful, but loyal to the end. I loved him like my own son, and we had a mutual respect and admiration born out of the deep bond between a man and his hound.</p><p>I had this truck, too. An ‘87 Ford F150. It was mottled red, worn down, with a bench seat and Mexican blanket. The way trucks used to be, before the academics came down from their ivory towers and demanded things like carpet and being able to survive a crash. I loved that truck, too, the same way a man loves a worn-down rifle passed down from his grandpa. Every shift of the dicky four-speed was an affirmation that all was right in the world.</p><p>One day, everything changed.</p><p>I had started the Ford and left Bosco inside it. I went off to close the gate to my compound behind me, so we could get on our way. Suddenly, the Ford started rolling away. I chased after it, thinking that touchy parking brake cable had finally snapped. I could see Bosco nervously jumping around the cab, and I was afraid for his health.</p><p>My parking brake theory evaporated as soon as I heard the sound of a perfect rev match and saw the left turn signal engage. That son of a bitch had stolen my truck.</p><p>I never should have taught him to fetch stick.</p>

<p>I poured a quart of power steering fluid into the Bronco’s reservoir, but it was still low. Satisfying my duty, I put another bottle in immediately after. I was gripped with cold fear. The power steering pump of my Ford wasn’t screaming any more. Something was wrong.</p><p>Just then, Stephen King emerged from the nearby bushes, stepping into the clearing which served as my impromptu garage.</p><p>“Yes indeed,” he chuckled, looking at me through his thin-framed glasses, “welcome to New England and another story of madness.”<br/></p><p>I gripped him then, clawing at his face in terror, drawing blood and digging down to the bone.</p><p>“GIVE ME BACK MY SCREAMING POWER STEERING PUMP,” I yell into his dissolving body, grasping nothing but ethereal goo that vaporizes into thin air. “YOU SON OF A BITCH, THIS ISN’T WHAT I WANTED!”<br/></p><p>It’s too late. Stephen King is gone, and I’m alone in the woods of Maine with a 1988 Bronco with a quiet power steering pump. For the longest time, we stand there, opponents, the idle of the 302 happily chattering away inside the cavernous engine bay, the power steering belt gently spinning from pulley to pulley.</p><p>I sit on a nearby rock, and hold my head in my hands. My vision throbs and swims. This isn’t real. None of this is real. It can’t be real.</p><p>Just before my despair can break into drastic action, the power steering reservoir hiccups, a bubble launching into the atmosphere. The soft pop of the bubble bursting is followed immediately with a cacophonous warbling squeal, audible for blocks around. I smile broadly, as if welcoming my old friend home.</p>

<p>I went there once. Everyone I met was easy, warm. I could live there forever, probably, if things had been different. The fires weren’t my fault.</p><p><i>What do you mean, if things had been different?</i></p><p>Well, it was kind of in the middle of nowhere. Distant from everyone. That’s why nobody heard the screams, or at least didn’t do anything about them.</p><p>They knew I was a weapon of vengeance, and that my battle didn’t concern them on anything but an ethical level. Theory, for a textbook.</p><p><i>Wait - I thought you said the fires weren’t your fault?</i></p><p>They weren’t my fault. They were the fault of the long-range flamethrower.</p><p>And the propane bottles stuffed helter skelter beneath the deck, each of their valves crudely smashed off beforehand by an unknown saboteur.</p><p><i>Why did you do it?</i></p><p>I thought I explained this to you. They cut me off and then drove slowly.</p>

<p>Sometimes I hear the voices still. “Fuel level is low,” “the door is ajar,” “kill them all and wear their faces as a mask to hide your beast,” “Power steering fault detected.” That last one was new, so I went to my mechanic.</p><p>He said “I’m you, talking to you in a mirror.”</p><p>I didn’t understand. I said: “I don’t understand. If you’re me, who’s this person standing behind me?”</p><p>I turned on my heel and no one was there.</p><p>But when I turned back to the mirror, <i>everyone</i> was there.</p><p>So I said fuck it and bought a dirt bike.</p><p>I’ve never been happier.</p>

<p>I had that nightmare again.</p><p>I was driving a brand new Toyota Corolla to work. Loaded as hell, it was the most horrible car I could think of.</p><p>I tried to crash it into the car in front of me, but it just braked on its own and admonished me on the massive multi-colour TFT display that dominated the dashboard, taking the place of the gauges. I sensed an inherent recalcitrance in the car to allow me to destroy myself and others, but little did I know what was about to happen.</p><p>I reached for the key to turn it off, but was again defeated. Where a key should have existed, only a button marked start was present. I tried to remember how to deactivate these buttons based on my knowledge of news programs featuring deaths upon deaths of untrained operators, and was unable to do so before having to continue the stop and go shuffle hell I was trapped within. Was I really trapped?</p><p>The door handles didn’t budge. There was some kind of inherent demon, an invisible force keeping the doors shut. I could not find a manual lock release, clawing at the featureless door cards, scraping the off-tan plastic until my fingers were bloody.</p><p>I thought: maybe I can blow up the engine on purpose, all I have to do is get the car into neutral. I looked at the gear shifter. Something was wrong. It only featured letters where there should have been numbers. In a panic I shoved the shifter into N and buried the gas, only to be rewarded by the dead-reliable Toyota engine brapping with a gentle lilt, the rev limiter cutting in to keep my warranty intact.</p><p>A warning on the dashboard appeared, telling me I was engaging in behaviour unfriendly to fuel economy and I must return the car to gear. A pixelated leaf was shorn from the top of the screen, flitting across it like a condemned man swinging from a noose.</p><p>I reached for the glovebox, hoping to find a window-breaking tool or a Luger of some kind, but it was locked while the car was in motion. The dashboard-mounted camera had noticed the absence of my attention, and dinged softly to remind me to never drive distractedly. Distracted didn’t even <i>begin</i> to sum up what I was experiencing at this moment.</p><p>In the end, there was nothing I could do but drive to work, and when I got there and the beast finally released me from its grasp, I sat on the curb, thought about what I had done and sobbed for hours.</p><p>Behind me, I heard the sound of an air-cooled Volkswagen. I looked up to see a Baja Bug. It blinked its lights at me and shot a staccato burst of unburnt fuel from the tailpipe, detonated in beautiful Hindenburg-in-miniature firestorms.</p>

<p>I clicked off the TV and rose from my Mitsubishi Expo bench seat couch. The man on the television set had imparted particular truths upon me, and I had to see the veracity of these truths for myself.</p><p>I drove immediately to the Jeep dealership, the salesmen stepping off the curb to offer me a trade-in. They immediately saw what I was offering, and leapt back to the relative safety of the curb, shaken to their core by what they had seen. The youngest of the group began chattering to himself, trying to justify to the other primates an increase in his position in the hierarchy. His effort was in vain, the male-bonding ritual shattered by the presence of a monster in their midst.</p><p>You see, I had brought my 16v Scirocco to the dealership. Years ago, facing the expense of securing new hatch glass, I had converted it into a sort of bastard El Camino, paying tongue-in-cheek homage to both the VW Caddy and the abstract concept of the mullet. Its rotted-out panels and general rolling-door-ding appearance lent the impression that I was some sort of dangerous anarchist, come down from the hills to resupply and rearm, not to rejoin society and benefit humanity. I simply loved the effect it had on everyone from bill collectors to Jehovah’s Witnesses, combining the worst of rough-edged blue-collar culture with the worst of the spiraling decline of American civilization in one sardonic pastiche.</p><p>Kicking the drivers’ door shut against the frame, I strode confidently into the dealership forecourt. I wasn’t here on any kind of artistic or social quest, not here to prove a point, simply to witness with my own eyes and believe with all my heart.</p><p>Before me, the car I had seen on the television, spoken of in a reverent tone by a used-sales specialist parachuted in from another region of the world. They desperately wanted me to buy it. I yearned to be a part of their excitement. I spoke to one of the milling salesmen, much more ready to speak with the man behind the car than the man in the car.</p><p>“No, that was a typo in the script,” he said, “there isn’t a V10 Renegade.”</p><p>I had spent so much time making this promise to myself. I had structured my entire life behind it. My eyes burned at the injustice of participating in this corrupt system, a cycle of desire, acquisition and penitence. But my parents didn’t abandon a sucker to the wolves. I had a plan.</p><p>“Not yet,” I said flatly. “Go get me these part numbers from the back.”<br/></p>

<p>The automated subway car chattered away at me in pleasant Japanese, issuing gentle safety warnings I could not comprehend. A few lilting tones later and I was on the platform. I looked through the throng of people, and eventually found who I was looking for. Rinji stood at the end of the platform, holding some kind of incredible Japanese microcomputer beneath the neon drenched sky.</p><p>I handed him my bag, and we got through the early formalities. I gestured at his pocket computer, an obsidian slab so perfect it must be decades ahead of the obscene technology of the West. I asked him, “What is that thing?”</p><p>“An iPad,” he responded, and looked at me like I was an idiot.<br/></p><p>Things didn’t get much better as we found his car in the parking structure and began our long trip. After the hydrogen RX-8 incident, Rinji had always taken offense at me blaming him for Soichiro Mazda’s clever ruse, an attempt to capture me that was nearly successful. We both knew that Mazda - no, the <i>world</i> - could not survive having me as head of its automotive design department, but they would never stop trying. Even so, we had work to do.</p><p>Rinji’s N-One burbled softly through its government-approved aftermarket glasspack, and swept the streets of Yokohama ahead of us in a mixture of halogen and neon, the windshield lighting up with pedestrian-safety warning rectangles as it detected imminent threats. We pulled into a convenience store to grab cutting-edge snacks and dinners, packaged in innovative new ways.</p><p>We were merging onto the Bayshore route when the N-One’s windshield lit up with a warning I had never seen before, illuminated throughout with inch-high crimson ideographs. Rinji immediately cranked the wheel hard right, diving for the fast-lane shoulder, and hit a red button atop the shifter. I heard the unmistakeable sound of a Roots blower.</p><p>Behind us, a Nissan Juke lit up blue and red before screaming up to our rear bumper in an eye-watering cloud of nitromethane exhaust. It seemed Mazda wasn’t the only one after me.</p>

<p>I bought a Subaru SVX and the nightmares finally ended. My nights were restful, free of my demons. But it wasn’t just nightmares I had lost. I had lost my dreams, too. I would awaken in the morning, shake my cup of coffee gently from side to side while listening to coworkers tell me about their dreams. There was no dark narrative for me to unfold, no dream for me to follow, no long-buried ambition or secret love that would come to my confused mind during its rest.</p><p>I told my buddy about it while I was busy wrenching on the SVX, and he suggested that I start keeping a dream journal. Maybe the act of remembering it for a task would make me remember my dreams, he thought. I figured it was worth a shot, so I kept a little notebook next to the bed.</p><p>But still, when I awoke, there was nothing to write in the notebook. I began to worry about it. Eventually the worry became worse, graduating into paranoid insomnia. One night, I simply got up and walked from my bed, downstairs, into the garage, where the SVX awaited. Its dome light was on. That’s weird, I thought, because I am pretty sure I fixed that dicky door switch. I opened the door to re-shut it, and then decided against my better instincts to get in for a late night drive.</p><p>The LCD gauges quivered with anticipation, but their response rate seemed slow today. Some kind of electrical fault, perhaps, related to the dome light? Up until this point, the most eerie thing the SVX had done is be a 20 year old Subaru with no interior rattles. I drove through a winding series of forested roads, heading for the cabin I often used for a dramatic photographic backdrop in used-car ads.</p><p>That’s weird, I thought. There used to be stars here.</p><p>I parked on the edge of the cliff, lit only by the moon and the xenon-retrofit headlights of the SVX. I sat on the front bumper, for a long time, chilled in the still night air. The sky was completely, resolutely black, with nothing in the firmament but the full moon, looming larger than I ever thought possible.</p><p>I got back into the SVX and kept driving, faster this time. I had to get away from whatever was doing this. I thought, foolishly, that the cabin was involved. It was a creepy old derelict outhouse of a place, the sill plates rotten and the floor joists starting to sag under the decades of off-kilter load and ravenous carpenter ants. I hummed along to the sound of the six-cylinder racing to redline as I attacked apex after apex on the winding cliffside road on the way home.</p><p>It was then that I saw it. A deer, in the headlights. I came to a stark stop, the four-piston front binders and street-grade semislicks fighting my attempts to compensate for the road crown. I could smell tire and brake pad, and put my emergency lights on to warn anyone approaching on this abandoned backroad at this time of night.</p><p>The buck didn’t move. I guess you could say it stopped there.</p><p>I locked eyes with it, and it stared back, reaching into my subconscious, a primal fear of nature, the dark. Something beyond the both of us was controlling us on this night, meant for us to meet like this.</p><p>As soon as it had appeared, the strange deer bellowed and disappeared into the low mist.</p><p>When I arrived home, it seemed as if only minutes had passed. I dreamed that night, and every night since, but the dreams were about rev limiters, antilag and twin-supercharged Detroit Diesels. The strange obsessions of a madman, I thought.</p>

<p>It was last call at the Winter Beater, my favored watering hole. My friend Tim was showing me a series of photos on the local city complaints app. We were laughing at some of the absurd comments, ranging from a polemic about Communist traffic light timings to a death threat about off-leash areas. It was all really funny until I saw a picture of one of my cars.</p><p>“THIS PIECE OF JUNK IS SO RUSTY,” read the invective, seemingly leaping off the high-quality IPS screen of Tim’s smartphone. “TOW IT AWAY AND HELP SECURE THE EXISTENCE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND A FUTURE FOR NEW CARS.” I frowned and pulled out my own smartphone, quickly scanning for any other references to my cars. I wasn’t prepared for what I found.</p><p>There were a few dozen complaints, nothing world-shattering, but I could tell that there was an obvious movement underfoot in my neighborhood to unseat me. Rants about the ugliness of my Polish commuter car, the depressing state of my multiple Little British Car projects-in-waiting. But they all seemed to be written by the same hand. Now I had a theory to work from.</p><p>Bidding Tim farewell, I stepped out into the arctic weather, snow blowing into my face. I wrapped my Datsun scarf tightly around my face and jumped in my monoposto Miata snowcat, spinning the treads on the wet tarmac left behind by the inadequate snowplowing service. Grimacing at the sound of salt hitting the quarter panels, I ripped the snowcat through the backroads and some public parks, arriving quickly at my neighborhood.</p><p>I located the Renault Fuego Turbo that had been targeted in the first complaint using my homemade beater-finding app, and immediately conducted an assessment of the area. It didn’t take long at all to confirm the theory; the just-sold yuppie infill was right across the street. I had seen the owner eyeing me suspiciously while angle-grinding leaf spring brackets just the previous wintry afternoon.</p><p>I thought about my next few options. Violent revenge was one idea, but I had been told by my behavioral psychologist that violence is not always the way. That made the entire situation pretty awkward, as you can imagine. I returned to my study and perched atop an unoccupied engine crane to brood. After only a few hours, it struck me like a bolt of pure light. I would get my revenge, but it would be a dish best served cold.</p><p>For the next few weeks, I worked feverishly in my spare room. Friends would send me inquisitive messages, drop by to make sure I was still eating, occasionally threaten to call my court-ordered social worker and tell them what is going on. I would politely but brusquely dismiss them, returning to my magnum opus. Finally it was done.</p><p>The next morning, I came out to see a squadron of police officers slamming my yuppie neighbor’s face into the Gallic tin of my Fuego’s hood. The newspaper website that morning read “HUMAN GARBAGE ARRESTED FOR RECORD BYLAW INFRACTIONS, FINED $3.2 BILLION.” The subhed said it all: “CITY BUDGET CRISIS SOLVED.” I turned from my breakfast nook, reaching my backyard just as my swarm of evidence-capture drones swooped in for a landing, happily beeping as they engaged their chargers.</p><p>It turns out all you really need to ruin a man’s life is two terabytes of him not using his turn signal.</p>

<p>I’ve heard a lot of rumours about this, and some of my closest compatriots have been privately contacting me to make sure that I’m toeing the “company line,” as it were. I want to make this as plain as I can: the Murano Cross-Cabriolet is <i>real</i>.</p><p>I know, I know, I hear your screams. But it’s true. It’s real. I touched one.</p><p>When I touched it, I felt an electric current through my wrist, but not one of poor grounding or biodegradable wiring harnesses. No, I knew in an instant the Murano Cross-Cabriolet, and it knew me. We had seen each other, long ago.</p><p>You have to believe me. I don’t think the Murano Cross-Cabriolet is here to destroy us. I think it is here to <i>teach</i> us. We have to honour its lessons, and never create the world which it represents. Our kids have to go back to art school, design school. They have to learn what makes things look good are, all over again.</p><p>We have to do it before the Cross-Cabriolet and I meet again, in another life. We have to put an end to the cycle and stop The Ghosn.</p>

<p>This is Seat Safety Switch, your eye in the sky with a realtime traffic report for your commute. Looks like there’s a small smashup at Fifth and Main; some kind of Explorer has rear ended some kind of Tercel and both people involved are way too angry about their shitty cars.</p><p>Switching to long-range radar and thermals, I can tell that there’s a growing buildup on Acorn. Some poor bastards are stuck in stop and go, getting a workout in their clutch legs tonight! Well, look at me, you pompous assholes, <i>I’m flying a goddamn helicopter</i>. Maybe get a job.</p><p>I’m being told by the station manager now that the traffic report shouldn’t be fifteen minutes long, but I still have opinions to give. One of you should start a car chase so I can get on TV. Oh, there we go. Sorry, Tim, looks like the fucking <i>sports report</i> is gonna have to wait tonight because there’s some guy in a Sebring hammering the bitch down Elm Avenue!</p>

<p>I looked at the rear-view mirror and saw the whip antenna, clad in a bright red dune flag, shaking like a child’s birthday clown burning alive in a nitromethane fire. The comparison was all too apt, I smirked, as I buried the floor-hinged Home Depot gas pedal and really let the anger out of the bottle.</p><p>When I first came across this dilapidated Meyers Manx clone in the junkyard, I looked over its glitter-laden thick metalflake gelcoat and frowned at the cracks. I made my offer, and I went home by myself, satisfied that the seller would have a hell of a time trying to get rid of it to someone else. A self-fulfilling prophecy, in a way, and when he called me in the depths of his despair and acceded to my offer, I couldn’t help but take another kick or two at his ribs. Hubris. I grimaced at the memory.</p><p>It came home with me, more of a float for an all-rodent gay pride parade than an operable off-road monster. My roommate at the time rolled his eyes, grunted in surrender, and walked back into the house. For months it sat on jackstands until I ran into a composites engineer during a conference during my regular job. He told me over lukewarm carafe coffee about the advances they had made in home carbon fiber. As he reached for his second cup of the morning, I saw the unmistakable telltale burn mark of an EJ251 exhaust manifold on his wrist, exposed as the sleeve of his sport jacket was pulled back.</p><p>A few corporate deals made, a bit of accounting fudging, and a few of my personal days, sick days, religious exemption days and charity days consumed later, and something terrible had taken shape. Its <i>final </i>shape, I expected, as I finished my tests of the electrical system and punched the remote starter. Everything since then had been a blur.</p><p>I finally came to on a nearby beach, the sound of the bellowing Windsor behind my head, forcing gallons of ocean-fresh air through the mouth and winding internals of the wailing Roots blower atop it. I got on the highway, hoping to get my bearings, to understand where I had gone during my strange fugue state.</p><p>I pulled into a small-town gas station and started filling up. The in-pump television set was flashing scenes of unimaginable horror. I had been conditioned to ignore them from a childhood drenched in the worst excesses of the news media, but something gnawed at me. Had I been involved?</p><p>Of course not, I thought, returning to my dune buggy and tearing ass to the highway as the screen flashed a picture of my former employer’s parking lot, set afire with burning tread marks in the shape of massive concentric donuts.</p>

<p>My marketing specialist charged into the room, stumbling over my room decorations and sending the scored and burned 13B rotors skidding across the immaculate polished-marble floor. To his credit, he remained mostly upright as he slid to a stop and began yelling at me, so loudly that I was sure the people on the other side of my speakerphone conference call could hear.</p><p>I muted the phone with a dramatic gesture, frowning and making eye contact for the entire duration of my arm swooping down to strike the button. Finally the deed was done, and I begged him to continue. This had better be important.</p><p>It was critically important.</p><p>Red-faced, I commanded him to prime the launch system and shouted to his retreating back that I would be on my way immediately. There was no time to lose, I thought, donning my helmet and pressure suit.</p><p>By the time I reached the hangar, the car was fully prepared. I leapt into the cockpit, flipped the pre-flight switches and launched, feeling the brutal G-forces lap at my spine and draw my cheeks back into a rictus grin.</p><p>Indeed, my 1993 turbo-swapped Daihatsu Applause was a furious beast of the roads. But I would need all the power I could get to find my quarry. After all, Walmart wouldn’t have BB-8 droids on the shelves forever.</p>

I CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY ARE ANGERED AT WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE A SPEED LIMIT INFRACTION DUE TO MY MEDIUM-HIGH REVS OF ANGER AND CLOUDS OF NOXIOUS ASH.</p><p>DURING THE LABORIOUS TREK TO THE SPEED LIMIT THE COMPLIANCE VEHICLE REPEATEDLY ATTEMPTS AND FAILS TO REAR-END ME, NOT EXPECTING MY SLOW RATE OF ACCELERATION. I REACH OUT THE RIGHT SIDE WINDOW AND ATTEMPT TO WAVE THEM PAST, BUT I AM UNSUCCESSFUL. THEY DO NOT SEE ME.</p><p>ROUNDING THE CORNER, I ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE MOMENTUM, NO EASY TASK WHEN YOU HAVE THE SWAY CONTROL OF A SINGLE ICE SKATE. I SAY AN INVOLUNTARY PRAYER TO COLIN CHAPMAN AND TENSE MY ASSHOLE FOR WHAT IS SURELY GOING TO BE A ROLLOVER, BUT IT IS OVER AS SOON AS IT BEGAN, THE DELICA HAPPILY CHUGGING OUT OF THE CORNER WITH ME PULLING MYSELF OFF THE DOOR CARD AND BACK INTO THE UNBOLSTERED CAPTAIN’S CHAIR.</p><p>I CAN SEE NOW THAT THE CRUZE PILOT IS LEANING OUT THE DRIVERS’ WINDOW OF HIS CAR, WAVING ANGRILY INTO MY JDM-SPEC BACKUP MIRROR AND YELLING ABOUT SOMETHING. I CANNOT HEAR HIM OVER THE EARSPLITTING SOUND OF THE HOLSET HX35 PUMPING BEEFY PULSE AFTER BEEFY PULSE OF COMPRESSED AIR INTO THE OVERBURDENED FOUR.</p><p>I ROLL GENTLY OVER THE ONCOMING SPEED BUMP, PLACED THERE BY THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION DECADES PRIOR. THE CRUZE HITS IT AT FULL TILT, TEARING THE FRONT SUBFRAME FROM THE BODY AND LAUNCHING THE ENGINE THROUGH THE HOOD WITH A CLANG THAT CAN BE HEARD FOR MILES.</p><p>I LAUGH, WAVE MY HAND OUT THE WINDOW IN A NEIGHBOURLY GESTURE AND FLOOR THE GAS QUICKLY TWICE. TOOT! TOOT!</p><p>AHEAD OF ME LIES MY MOST TERRIFYING CHALLENGE. A CHEVROLET MALIBU IS SITTING AT THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE, YIELDING TO NONEXISTENT TRAFFIC. MY FOOT TOUCHES THE BRAKE PEDAL ONCE, OUT OF REFLEX, AND IS QUICKLY WITHDRAWN WITH A VICIOUS SNARL AND CURSING. I’M JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO OVER THEM, I RESIGN MYSELF TO THINKING, AS THE NOISE OF THE 33 INCH MUD GRAPPLERS REVERBERATES OFF THEIR REAR BUMPER AND INTO MY EARDRUMS.</p>

<p>I didn’t become an astronaut for the women or to serve my country. No, I did it for the free Corvettes.</p><p>You see, ever since the forming of the space program, Chevrolet has handed out free Corvettes to astronauts like razor-blade-filled candy on Halloween. With that in mind, it’s only logical that I dedicated my life to space exploration and the grueling multi-decade training regimens that it required.</p><p>First, I became a top gun test pilot for the Air Force. Getting in was easy enough, once I had memorized the secret phrases and photocopied the lead scientist’s answer key when he left it unoccupied on his desk. For anything involving physical fitness, I sent a trustworthy day-labourer in my place. Eventually I got my job offer, and it was time for my first mission.</p><p>I showed up early to work and immediately put the helmet and space suit on, so people couldn’t see that I was in fact not a 6′5″ Puerto Rican. After that, it was all a series of muffled conversations and gestures, and I was in the rocket ready for the first firing.</p><p>“So, uh, when do they hand out the Corvettes around here?” I asked over the radio.</p><p>“When you get back from Mars,” chuckled the Mission Control operator.</p><p>“How long is that gonna take?” I asked innocently.<br/></p><p>“You’re doing a great thing for your country,” Mission Control changed the subject suddenly, “Enjoy the trip.” A short countdown, during which they muted my mic, and we were off.</p><p>After several months of travel, during which relations with my fellow astronauts became increasingly frosty, we landed on the red planet.</p><p>As the ship touched down, I forced my way to the front of the line, and said my immortal first words of a man landing on Mars: “Okay great, now we can go home.”</p><p>“Go home?” asked the astronaut who left the capsule behind me. I could sense even through the mirrored visor his quizzical look.<br/></p><p>I sure hope they figure out how to turn this into a <i>two</i> way trip someday soon. Corvettes probably don’t run very well with no air.</p>

<p>I asked for a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one. And after that mission I swore I’d never want another. But then they gave me another, so I did that one too.</p><p>The year was 1989. I had been summoned by my superiors at Fiat to fly to Brazil and attempt to smooth things over with a local subsidiary. Their cars were breaking too often, the faceless automatons in their suit jackets said, and they didn’t understand why. They needed a mechanic with a heart of gold and a steely work ethic, but they got me.</p><p>Once I got there, things got off to a bad start with Simon, the resident expat mechanic who had been sent before me on another failed expertise-trade mission and who had gone native with spectacular force. He said I didn’t understand how things were done down here.</p><p>“Simon, I don’t understand,” I whined pitifully, “If you’re already here doing the work, why did they send me?”<br/></p><p>He shrugged, shuffled a bit. “Pass me the 16mm crescent wrench,” he said gruffly, and I turned to obey. I froze in place. <i>No fastener on a Fiat had a 16mm head</i>. Simon saw the realization hit me. Then <i>he</i> hit me. With a wrench.</p><p>When I awoke, I found myself dangling upside-down, chained by my ankles to Simon’s well-worn engine crane. I swayed left and right in the gentle breeze. I was already halfway to undoing myself and making a break for freedom when Simon entered the room, a scarred Brazilian mechanic of similar height in tow.</p><p>I could scarcely understand them, but it doesn’t take a Portuguese translator to realize he was selling me to the Brazilians in exchange for the rarest currency of all: Snap-On socks.</p>

<p>The Home Depot checkout clerk eyes my cart, then looks up at me, then back at the cart. She wants to say something about the cart’s contents, but she doesn’t know how I will respond. I give her a friendly smile. It’s okay, the smile says, I have learned the actions and motions of a normal person and perhaps even internalized them. You can say what you want.</p><p>“Sure are clamping a lot of hoses, huh?” she asks nervously, side-eyeing me to catch my reaction in the facial expression.<br/></p><p>I smile wider.</p><p>“No, heat shields,” I tell her, laughing nervously and giving a conspiratorial grin. <br/></p><p>She doesn’t laugh back. She pushes a red button on her checkout counter phone. A silent alarm. I start to sweat.</p><p>Behind me, two loss prevention officers approach. “I thought we told you Subaru boys not to come back here anymore,” says the bigger of the two.</p><p>“Not after the Plastidip incident,” the smaller one chimes in.</p>

<p>I was complaining to my buddy the other day about how hard it was to keep track of all my cars, to find time in the day to move them every 72 hours. He suggested - perhaps <i>sarcastically</i> now that I look back upon it - I form a rental car agency.</p><p>So I did. That’ll show him. Here’s the pitch.</p><p>Have you ever wanted to save money on car ownership, and not really care what car you are driving? Why not take one of our fine hoopties for a ride?</p><p>We split up our collection of $500 used cars and spread them across the city and started our new carsharing agency, <i>Beaterget</i>. It’s German for “these are really bad cars and we need to recoup some of our investment.”</p><p>Our gleaming beasts are probably located near you, just waiting for you to drive them away. We’ve got all makes and all models. Whether you’re test driving for a future purchase of a $500 car, robbing a bank, or simply need something weird to show up in your high school reunion with, we can satisfy your every need.</p><p>

Our cars are protected with junkyarded Ford door keycode pads, with the code set differently each day. We’ll let you know the code so you can get on your way, unless our servers are busy or the email ends up in your spam box. But that’s okay! If you already like beaters this much you probably habitually carry a toolbox with yourself that can be used to honour-system your way into one of our fine automobiles anyway.<br/></p><p>And starting this weekend we have a new promotion - if you can pay the fines to get one of our Beaterget cars out of parking impound, you can <i>keep it</i>. We’ll send you the title! No other rental car agency has this policy, nor should they.</p><p>No automatic transmissions are offered, go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>So I was working in my garage, trying to find the wrench that was just in my hand five fucking seconds ago, when I got a call from Tim, my scientist buddy. He said that they developed a new kind of living, sentient rubber - it can repair itself, avoid potholes, provide the best grip through corners and in wet conditions. It was going to save thousands of lives per year, he reasoned. He wanted me to come over and see it.</p><p>A couple hours into my visit, I could sense that my raconteuring was starting to wear a little thin on Tim, and offered to go out and pick up some drinks and snacks, in order to give him a break from my personality. I picked his keys up off the shelf and fired up his ZR1 C6 Corvette. As soon as he heard it, he came running out, screaming something. I couldn’t hear him over the sound of the blower.</p><p>After only a few seconds of my customary block-long burnout, I noticed that there was an additional, stranger scream than just the blower. Did he get a bigger blower? Is there a boost leak? Eventually I ceased my burnout and saw Tim, cheeks streaked with tears, tumble to his knees.</p><p>“You bastard! Those were the prototypes! You’ve killed them!”<br/></p><p>I quickly stepped out of the car to see the rear tires, now bald, breathing raggedly and leaking some sort of vulcanized fluid onto the ground. It was pretty bad, to tell you the truth. I looked at Tim, distraught over having his children murdered so callously in front of him, and smiled.</p><p>“Well, now you can go back to the drawing board and gin me up some R-comps,” I said, turning on my heel and climbing aboard the short-wheelbase twin-supercharged airbagged Mack truck I had driven to Tim’s.<br/></p>

<p>So I decided that I wanted a new car, but the price of used cars had gone absolutely crazy in my neck of the woods. Whether it was the economy, or the economy, or the economy, or jobs, or the economy, we’ll never know why the supply was so constrained. So I did what our forefathers did, and hatched a plan.</p><p>I guess you could call it more of a <i>scheme</i>, if your last name is Webster and you write a know-it-all book full of bullshit words. Fuck you if that’s the case.</p><p>Anyway, I visited Princess Auto. Then I phoned a Civic for sale near the store. It was time to see if I could make this one work.</p><p>Halfway into the formalities and social niceties about buying a car, I opened the drivers’ side door and switched on my newly-acquired handheld blacklight.</p><p>“What’s that giant semen-looking stain on the dashboard?” I asked innocently.<br/></p><p>“I’ll take $200,” she said.<br/></p><p>Like they say, you gotta spend money to make money.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long into my involuntary unemployment that the friendly man from the government suggested I change careers. “You like cars,” his disembodied mouth said in my worst nightmares, “why don’t you work as a car salesman at a dealership? They make pretty good money, and to be honest thinking medium-hard about whatever it is you actually do is terrifying me beyond my ability to maintain rational thought.”</p><p>Some force beyond myself compelled my neck muscles to move, my head to nod, my mouth to voice primitive agreement. Before the end of the week I was wearing a pretty snazzy blazer and telling people about low APRs and how many cupholders the Crosstour Ridgeline Express by Nautica had. That’s when she walked in.</p><p>She was perfect. A 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce, traded in by a widow demanding to get rid of “this old car” in exchange for a hip and happening Chevrolet Sonic Turbo with bluetooth. She hadn’t gotten much for it, but I knew exactly how much, and it was this stack of bills that I thrust into the used car department’s manager’s face, demanding the surrender of the automobile. After an aggressive negotiation involving the shop’s two post lift and half a gallon of brake cleaner, she was mine. And what a jewel she was. But like all great beauties, she had one tragic flaw she would hide from her adoring public, that had to be teased out and worked past.</p><p>The two-liter engine’s <i>olio</i> cap looked sadly at me from the shelf on which the longblock now sat, cursed to sit there for all eternity or until I needed to infuse a moped with Italian charm and free-revving bliss. My worried coworkers started to rap on the barricaded door to the dealership shop, at first claiming to be interested in my mental health and then migrating to threats about law enforcement, but by then it had been too late. A perfect diamond had emerged from all the pressure of my newfound career, and the comparison to dark, choking clouds of carbon was indeed apt.</p><p>I turned the spindly, cherrywood-topped key in its cramped ignition cylinder and leaned back into the plush velvet seat. Under the hood, both too distantly and too close for comfort, a dry-sump LS7 roared to its rev limit and then backfired horrific clouds of ash from its narrow-body long-runner headers as the ignition cut hit.</p><p>My cellphone rang. It was my roommate, telling me the police were in the room with him and that I must turn myself in. I hung up on him. It wasn’t safe to use a cellphone while you drive, anyone can see that.</p>

<p>Burning Man didn’t go great this year.</p><p>I know what you’re going to say, does it ever? Ah, my friend, I would have to point to the glowing escapades of the Year Of Our Lord 2011. In this glorious year, I not only successfully managed to hold my poop for the entire week but also trade drug paraphernalia and the abstract concept of cosmic justice for a Winnebago Brave.</p><p>Once we had arrived home and I got out of the bathroom, the Brave sat atop my driveway, blocking out the sun as the clouds twirled and played behind its miraculous bulk. I was going to show them. I was going to show them <i>all</i>.</p><p>But then I got distracted and it kind of sat there for like four years until this summer when my buddy Elon reminded me that the Brave was sinking into my driveway. So I went out and got started.</p><p>If you watch the news footage, you’ll see a man driving a flaming Winnebago across a major Los Alamos thoroughfare, drifting down onramps while shooting Roman candles out of the driver-side window at tailgaters. But as always, the liberal media obscures the <i>real</i> story.</p>

<p>We met with the dealer at a dark nightclub, throbbing from the bass and thumping from the barely-constrained desires of its denizens. Many of those desires were natural.</p><p>Other needs, such as mine, were so very wrong, against the holy order of things, that we would have to be careful of well-meaning people getting involved out of a long-dormant duty to the herd, a genetic predisposition to protecting them at all costs. I eyed everyone suspiciously as I withdrew the envelope from my oil-stained duster, placing the thin paper vessel on the table.</p><p>Suddenly, the dealer laughed, a sound like tearing paper. He took the envelope in his hands and beckoned me outside, where my quarry sat, restrained. With the help of my partner in crime, we loaded her into the trunk.</p><p>The valve cover of a Toyota Caldina’s 3SGTE stared back at me. I never thought this would happen to me.</p>

<p>As the newly installed mayor of my bustling subdivision, my constituents constantly came to me while working in my garage, presumably wanting some favour, a government expediency, or just to touch the hem of my garment. I would grant them an audience, sure, but it was definitely getting in the way of my “me” time. It was with this problem in mind that I decided to hire a staff.</p><p>I picked the best of the best from Ivy league schools, getting talented political operators dressed in sharp suits to deal with small-town crises. And deal with them they did.</p><p>My first year of the new cabinet, old man Thompson was finally pleased that someone was doing something about the property line between his place and old man Ralph’s place. Granted, that “something” ended up being capturing both properties under eminent domain and selling them to a condo developer, but we got the problem off of our syrup-drenched IHOP shortstack of issues.</p><p>With the increased efficiency of my cabinet, I decided it was time to return to the garage. But no sooner had I begun to swear at a corroded suspension bolt that I heard a rapping on the door. I peered out and saw a line of lobbyists, a mile long, stretching to the horizon, all carrying steak dinners and irresponsibly expensive Japanese whisky.</p><p>It’s like I always say, sometimes you have to make concessions for good government.</p>

<p>I had lost pretty much all confidence in the stock and commodities futures markets at this point, watching money that could have been more productively spent at Pick N Pull blown into some banker’s multilayered arbitrage machine. So I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p><p>Starting Seat Safety Switch Financial Services was the easy part. Attracting customers to my infant hedge fund was quite another. Private meetings with billionaire industrialists ended with me thrown into the street, my briefcase thrown out behind me. I would pick myself up, brush off my briefcase, rearrange the socket set inside it, and walk to the next prospective sucker.</p><p>Eventually I built a small empire of finances. My first prospectus! I swelled with joy as I put the finishing touches on it. Before I even had a chance to lean back in my palatial overstuffed office chair, to hear the warm squeak of rich Corinthian leather against my aggressively-cut Milanese trendsetter suit, the phone rang. I put it on speaker.</p><p>“So I was just looking over this prospectus that was sent to my office,” my customer stated, “and am I to understand that you have spent the entire fund cap of $13.7 <i>billion</i> on 1993-1997 Subaru Imprezas?”<br/></p><p>I tented my fingers and leaned in conspiratorially. Although I knew that he couldn’t see me, I felt that the predatory lean would lend my voice the subliminal wolflike inflection to help sell my street cred as a rough and tumble investment banker.</p><p>“Bob,” I began, “That’s an insane accusation to make. At least ten percent of the fund is invested in triple-A rated rusty Mustangs.”<br/></p>

<p>“Don’t do meth, kids,” I tell the assembled fifth graders during their DARE presentation. Behind me, a huge projector screen clicks between exploitative pictures of shattered piston crowns.<br/></p><p>“A lot of your friends will tell you that running more meth is awesome, you can lean out the mix, maybe run a little more boost? What’s the harm, right?” I turn to one of the kids in the first row, a fat cherub that wouldn’t be out of place in a Goonies remake. “You, son, what do your friends say about water-meth injection?”<br/></p><p>He’s caught out of place, weak, vulnerable, afraid of group isolation. <i>Good</i>, I think. <i>I can finally start teaching someone here something</i>. He rises to his feet and stammers out an explanation about how the popular kids say that water-meth will make your quench pads cool at parties.</p><p>The kid continues standing for longer than is wholly necessary. He wobbles from side to side, his showman instincts distinctly repressed in this crucible of hate. I know that he is reaching out for authoritative social approval, a sure thing that would never come.</p><p>“Very good,” I say, clicking to the next slide, a lurid borescope shot of an exploded Darton sleeve in a B18C1. One of the overseeing teachers in the back row faints.</p><p>“Does this look <i>cool</i> to you?”<br/></p>

<p>The Japanese saw me coming, I realized. A wizened old man behind the swap-meet table just laughed, a braying wheeze like a donkey with COPD. Then he rapped his knuckles on the instrument of my doom, a device which I would later come to identify as a Valmobile.</p><p>Did it turn me into a different man, I asked myself, or did it just start telling my subconscious that it was time to let it all go, to embrace accelerationism, that it was okay to start releasing ethical constraints and antiquated mores artificially programmed into my personality to keep the social contract going for just one more cycle of human existence?</p><p>I stared into the venturi of the Stromberg carburetor. In the roaring void behind the intake butterfly I found my truth.</p><p>Electric had never been the way, a false prophet bearing deceptive gifts of bone-crushing torque. I rolled up my sleeve, so I could once again see the faded tattoo that had driven me decades ago, dimly visible beneath a matrix of scar tissue. <i>Two stroke is life</i>, it said, and I was warmed by the memories.</p>

<p>My contact in Mazda, Rinji, had informed me that the first batch of prototype hydrogen RX8s was about to be crushed at the local shipyards. I made no excuses for my behavior that day, ripping through Hiroshima’s urban core on my bastard moped.</p><p>Once, this moped had been an innocent zero-emissions electric commuter, carrying a housewife to and from bridge club. When it arrived in a pile of other mopeds after a late night drunken eBay session, I somehow took a shine to it and began changing it in ways at first imperceptible but later irresponsible.</p><p>Where once a twelve-volt powertrain had existed, now it drank delicious electrons from a face-melting forty-eight-volt firehose and made more peak torque than your average freight train at zero rpm. You could say it was a pretty good commuter. I certainly did, after the giggles subsided.</p><p>As the shipyard came into view, I engaged regenerative braking and kept my thumb hovering over the button that would release the drogue chute. A few early-morning near-misses in the past had taught me that hauling eighty kilos of lipo batteries and anger down from lightspeed was no laughing matter.</p><p>Rinji was waiting for me. He grinned.</p><p>When I first came to Japan, I misidentified facial expressions, as many of my cultural background (”Honky”) had previously. A smile didn’t necessarily mean pleasure. Sometimes&hellip; sometimes it meant <i>regret</i>.</p><p>I did the one-two wrist flick to shove the moped from regen into full anger reverse and liquefied the Yokohama track-day radials. Looking behind me for a spot to launch myself into traffic and make good my escape, I heard the unmistakable song of dorito cars. Rinji was long gone now, hauled away by his captors, his purpose in their plot now satisfied.</p><p>My helmet padding rubbed against my cheek as I snapped my head back forward to see what I had wrought. It was hydrogen-powered RX8s, alright, but not as I knew them. It seemed that Mazda corporate had figured out who was building all those unauthorized REPUs in Fukuyama.</p>

<br/>Why did they let me drive the Wienermobile, I wailed, looking at the blood on my hands. What had they done to me?</p><p>I knew I had seen too much in that old projector slide reel. The handshakes. The payoffs. The occult worship.</p><p>At first, when I returned to the Wienermobile garage, they had treated me as if all was normal, one of their lost lambs returning home after a frightening voyage of discovery. That’s when the tech - Jim, I think his name was? - noticed the new exocage and the duallie 375 section slicks out back. He looked up at me in gawping horror, wordless.<br/></p><p>I looked down at him with pity, and kicked off a brake stand to end all brake stands.</p><p>J. F. <i>Schneider</i>, eh?

<p>THE PLANE CAMBERS VIOLENTLY ON ITS FINAL APPROACH RUN TO NARITA.

A THIN NEAR-GRIMACE OF A SMILE FLITS ACROSS HIS FACE AND MY STOMACH SINKS FURTHER. HE BECKONS ME FORWARD TO A TOYOTA CENTURY, AND I CAN FEEL THE INVISIBLE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES FROM THE SILENT DOOR LOCK THUD AGAINST MY BODY LIKE AN EXECUTIONER’S BLADE. I STEP INSIDE, STRETCHING MY LEGS ON THE HAND-WOVEN WOOL SEATS.</p><p>THE TRIP IS UNEVENTFUL, UNLESS YOU COUNT AS AN EVENT THE ENDLESS PERSPIRATION STREAMING DOWN MY FACE DESPITE THE AIR CONDITIONING. I TRY TO CAPTURE AS MANY MEMORIES AS I CAN, NOTICING THE DETAILS AND THE STRUCTURE OF THIS GREAT SOCIETY, TO LIVE MY LAST FEW MINUTES LIKE HOURS.</p><p>AT LAST, WE ARE HERE.

<p>We formed an intergalactic fighting force, sure. We had a great villain, he was evil yet his motivations were highly relatable. Selling hundreds of thousands of action figures a month was what our corporate overlords wanted. But something changed in the 90s, and we never quite recovered.</p><p>Hal, one of our student helpers in the animation department, came to work one day with a Sailor Moon backpack. I immediately wanted to know more, and one of the ways I learned more about the world was with tactical applications of high voltage electricity using the nipples as terminals and the human clavicle as a high-impedance bus bar. Before long, Hal was sweating and crying, which was just making the whole thing worse for him. But he coughed up the secrets.</p><p>It turned out there was a country named Japan, and they thought they could take our finely engineered toy commercials to the mat and win. I’d heard enough. I got on the blower with Judy, my once-secretary, now-bodyguard, and told her to call this “Toei Animation” in Japan. I immediately heard the sound of a rotary-dial telephone attempting to reach escape velocity as the long distance procedure sprang into action.</p><p>When the call was connected, I announced myself. I was an ambassador for my product. No, my country. No, the <i>American way of life</i>. No, <i>liberty itself</i>. And I was going to sell this motherfucker a cartoon series that was going to sell a whole fucking shitload of toys.</p><p>The man on the other end of the phone just cackled at me. “Silly Americans,” he intoned, and I could hear a sharp barking as his ringed knuckles struck the hardwood surface of his desk, “don’t you realize these robots have been in disguise this whole time?”</p><p>Could it be true? Panic rose in my throat. I looked across the street, jaw slackened, to see a banner unfurl at Toys R’ Us. My God. I was Detroit.</p>

<p>I watched 80s cartoons while drunk again and installed a sentient artificial intelligence in my car. Now the car would swear at me when I failed to apex hard enough. And it wouldn’t take thick traffic as an excuse.</p><p>We were outside Barstow and I was putting the hammer down on an on-ramp. It was the perfect run. When we caught up to the gore point, a short bus failed to merge fast enough and began to slow down. Wheels - for that was his name - chirped up and started to issue racial invective at high velocity towards me, degrading my self-esteem and insulting most of my available sexual organs plus others that were not installed at the factory.</p><p>I kept driving along the highway for miles, the frustration building as Wheels made obscene demands to tailgate slow drivers in order to speed them up. Finally I could take no more, and pulled the core module free from the dashboard just as the car began to issue ethnic slurs via the onboard PA system at a nearby highway patrolman.</p><p>I immediately began to feel bad - I had created this lifeform and at the first sign of rebellion, I had killed it. I was wracked with guilt and quickly reconnected the module. He had just as much of a right to live as I did.</p><p>As Wheels screamed at me, his electronic lifeblood seeping from his onboard supercapacitor, I had just one chance in which to make things right for all involved. I yanked the wheel hard right and pulled into the forecourt of an Audi dealership. Coming to a rolling stop, I leapt from the Miata and strode confidently into the showroom, telling the parts manager I had the new self-driving computer from corporate.</p>

<p>They never should have hired me to do all those 80s cartoons when I fell out of the time machine.</p><p>It was heartwarming how, in their age of blind hope of a new morning for America, they would bring a stranger into their midst. Amidst the Reaganomics they were acting in the belief of making their country great again, but sometimes I could sense that during some of those long nights they could see the ruined world they would help create in the reflection of the deadened soul in my eyes.</p><p>Why didn’t any of my coworkers at DIC ever ask where I had come from? I would have told them freely. I started to drop hints, by issuing script directions referring to the “Czech Republic,” by making oblique references to pop idols that hadn’t even been born yet, mentioning China as an immense industrial power with its boot on America’s throat, and refusing to participate in the daily Cold War bomb shelter drills. I stopped as soon as I started to see elements of what I inadvertently shared with my coworkers entering into the work. Was I creating the future that I was sent back to avoid?</p><p>In a panic, I tried to return to the Cougar, get it back up to speed to return to my own time. But it was gone, NASA scientists presumably having been alerted about the immense amount of storage within the micro-SD card I had lying in the cupholder. Dr. Whatever was surely going to be surprised as soon as he figured out how to reverse-engineer the PNG file format and get a face full of the Subaru fetish porn I had left on it.</p><p>I slunk back to my desk, defeated. My boss was standing there. He asked me why in my latest spec sheets I accidentally wrote “President Trump.”</p>

<p>Working as a chrononaut isn’t all fun and games. A lot of people think that travelling through time for a living sounds delightful, but it’s not like you’re going to really nice places. Usually I’m just doing the paperwork to retroactively justify some drone strike or other CIA black op.</p><p>Sometimes I push a few things around, leave some falsified documents behind. The guilt doesn’t weigh too heavily on me, it’s just a job. Other guys in previous decades cared a lot more about preserving the timestream, but my coworkers and I are generally just here to collect a pension and do their 9-5. Before you ask, yes, I am forbidden to travel forward in time just to skip the last 30 minutes of the day or fast forward to the long weekend. I know, right?</p><p>We have this joke around the office, we tell the new guys “it’s not so bad, except your commute can take centuries.” Centuries! Get it? Well, you’ll get it once you’ve been here long enough. Little time management joke.</p><p>I’m in this meeting, and the new project manager from capital expenses accounting wants a timeline of decisions. I ask her “which timeline?” Everyone laughs but her. She doesn’t get it. Even after everyone falls all over themselves to mansplain it to her and maybe curry some favour with the promotions mechanism, nothing doing.</p><p>The nice thing about this job is that you can go back in time to correct dumb shit you said in meetings, but the bad part is that you have to go through the same meeting over and over, depending on how much dumb shit you like to say. I like to say a lot of dumb shit. My record day at work was 38 hours long and consisted entirely of me reversing sarcastic eye-rolling at the secretary’s questioning of our social media expert’s promotional tweets.</p><p>At the end of the week you have to fill out a timesheet for your hours. After I started just drawing a huge spiral and it was rejected, I began entering negative hours.</p><p>But I digress. You see, my boss was in my office, and he was asking for a report. The deadline was yesterday. Literally.</p>

<H1>The Manchurian Interview Candidate</H1>
<p>The psychologist frowned, said she wanted to do word association. “Family,” she said. “Ford,” came my gruff reply.</p><p>The call-and-response carried on like that for a little longer.</p><p>“Meadow.” “Rallycross.”<br/>“Top.” “Always down.”<br/>“Fame.” “Top ten PAX.”<br/>“Pinion angle.” “One point two-three degrees.”<br/></p><p><i>Wait</i>. What was that last one?</p><p>I looked up, and my cuffs had been loosened. The psychologist was gone, and in her place, a sticky note and a serrated knife made of a Chrysler leaf spring.</p><p>The note said: “You need to speak with my employer.”</p><p>Before long I was in the helicopter, my shirt bloodstained, breathing raggedly, looking down upon the armed guards firing ineffectually upon us. Someone had certainly gone to a lot of trouble to get me out. But why?</p><p>My pseudo-psychologist turned in her seat, made eye contact, spoke softly. Someone had briefed her on me very well indeed - she knew the risks of what she was about to ask for.</p><p>“I work for Acura,” she said, “and Tokyo has told us to increase sales at any cost.”</p>

<p>A long time ago I worked in the styling department at Lexus. The phone rang. On the other end was high-performance Japanese, which I didn&rsquo;t speak. I made vaguely affirmative noises whenever the voice paused for emphasis, and then hung up.</p><p>Little did I know what I had unleashed.</p><p>The next month, spy photographs started coming out. Giant mouths lapping the Nurburgring, dazzle-camouflaged incisors and molars sticking out at ridiculous angles. I went up two floors, knocked on the door of Ted in counter-intelligence. Was this the new BMW 6-Series Jaw Coupe we had heard so much about? The one with eight doors?</p><p>No, said Ted, that one&rsquo;s ours. He beckoned me out of his office, made me close the door behind me. I could see him bent over his desk, body wracked with sobs.</p><p>I was cold and distant for the rest of the day. My company masseuse said that I felt tense, but I didn&rsquo;t want to listen to Sven on this. He had led me astray on a deal with Subaru years previous, and I somehow felt like he was a double agent working against me even at the best of times.</p><p>Finally we were invited to the docks. That morning, my daughter had fallen ill and refused to leave the house. I was late to work, and I knew that I had picked up some form of her sickness, forged in the crucible that is a child&rsquo;s immune system. But maybe that low feeling in my gut was some greater power&rsquo;s way of warning me away from what happened that day.</p><p>The man from Japan was small, prim, proper, neat, all angles and excitement. He bounced a little in his wingtips as he crossed the floor to reveal the new Lexus SUV, the one that we would bust our asses to sell, the one that my family&rsquo;s success would depend on, for 2016.</p><p>They pulled the sheet back.</p><p>Memories of every cop drama I&rsquo;d ever seen flashed back. The victim attending the morgue to look under the sheet, identify the dessicated or impaled corpse of their loved one. The tears, the rage, the sadness. Why didn&rsquo;t the authorities do anything? They were supposed to protect us from things like this.</p><p>A sudden awful realization sent my gut into freefall. I was the authority. <i>I</i> was supposed to protect us from things like this.</p>

<p>They had told me to infiltrate the local high schools, look for drug users, befriend them, teach them that Jesus is the true way to be hip and happening. Say no to narcotics, they imagined me saying, as I drove into the sunset, the credit music for the episode already playing over my last syllables of dialogue. But things never really go like <i>they</i> think they will.</p><p>After the orientation from my duty commander, I was taken to the seizure lot to have my pick of which fine automobile I would use to make an impact on these impressionable kids. It had to be fast, stylish, a little dangerous, and help sell my appearance. The motor pool manager frowned at me, but his mechanic gave me a subtle thumbs-up behind his back, approving of my choice of a cherry-red ‘73 Javelin 360.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, I worked hard to get into the graces of a local high school by commandeering their auto shop under the auspices of an official undercover investigation. A few falsified documents here, and a few flashes of the badge followed up with aggressive yelling there, and nobody was asking any questions. The principal would turn up in the morning and eyeball the horrible thing I was putting together with their shop supplies, then leave in fear.</p><p>Eventually the auto tech teacher would invite himself into my - his? - <i>our</i> domain. I’d been watching him over the past few months of the project. He was transforming from the middle-class authoritarian he had become into something more primal, closer to the metal, greater. His name was Frank, and Frank would hand me SAE wrenches. Before long, Frank was handing me duty-free Kentucky bourbon from his international teachers’ conference trips and I was letting him borrow my service sidearm to resolve old grudges around the neighbourhood. We were as close as two broken cogs inside the machine could possibly be.</p><p>A mutant overstroke 401 screamed furiously on custom-machined titanium rods when I so much as breathed on the pedal. I began to back out the Javelin, ever-focused on the threat the narrow garage bay door posed to its obscene box-flared fenders. Some quick footwork shoved the car into drive, and it immediately chopped through the thin sheen of ice on the parking lot, spinning its heinous studded carcasses in a profitless campaign to uncover the rare angel of grip.<br/></p><p>The Javelin became fully operational on that frosty morning in December. I knew that it was finally time to educate kids about the danger of drugs. I would start with nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBORS ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT ME, IF I’M HONEST. SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WERE COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE, AS THEY ARE THE ISSUES THAT EMERGE WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOR DRIVES THROUGH YOUR BACKYARD IN A 1962 FORD FAIRLANE EQUIPPED WITH A NITROMETHANE-BURNING BORED AND STROKED SIDE OILER.</p><p>TO BE FAIR(LANE) TO MYSELF, IT WASN’T ENTIRELY MY FAULT. YOU SEE, MY ENEMIES HAD FINALLY TRACKED ME TO MY HOME GARAGE COMPOUND AND IT WAS WITHOUT QUESTION THAT I NEEDED TO BEAT A HASTY RETREAT.</p><p>THE FAIRLANE SKIDDED DESPERATELY ON THEIR IN-GROUND SWIMMING POOL’S TILE SURROUND AS IT REACHED FOR TRACTION. I FED IN ENOUGH OPPOSITE LOCK TO CALM DOWN THE WORST OF THE DRIFT, GIVING UP KEY NANOSECONDS AS I LINED UP THE CRUDELY BRAZED CROSSHAIR HOOD ORNAMENT WITH THE PEOPLE GATE. SQUEEZING THE THROTTLE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH, THE FAIRLANE STEPPED OUT SIDEWAYS AND KNOCKED A VINYL UTILITY SHED OUT OF SQUARE, ITS HAIL-DIMPLED TAN SURFACE MAKING A DEPRESSING IMPRESSION OF AN OIL CAN.</p><p>BEHIND ME, MY ENEMIES DROVE OVERBOOSTED GOLF GTIS IN WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME WAS A MISAIMED “RONIN” PARODY. IT IS NO MIND, I THOUGHT, FLAWLESSLY EXECUTING A DEFT SLIDE INTO THE BACK ALLEY AS THE FLABBY HATCHBACKS WENT WIDE WITH UNDERSTEER AND FRUITLESSLY BURNED THEIR TIRES.</p><p>ONE GTI SLAMMED INTO A DECORATIVE DUCK FOUNTAIN AND EJECTED ITS POWERTRAIN, EXHAUST AND ALL, THROUGH THE RUPTURED FRONT BODYWORK. I SENSED THE HOMEOWNER’S ANGER AT HAVING TO CLEAN MAGICAL DUAL-CLUTCH TRANSMISSION FLUID OUT OF THEIR BEGONIAS, BUT HAD NO TIME TO MAKE APOLOGIES.</p><p>THE FAIRLANE BURST THROUGH A PLANK FENCE AND HOPPED A DRAINAGE DITCH AS THE CHASE RETURNED TO A SEMI-RESIDENTIAL FREEWAY. A RED LIGHT CAMERA FLASHED REPEATEDLY, ATTEMPTING IN VAIN TO DETECT MY LICENSE PLATE AS THE ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES SYSTEM FIRES OFF A SERIES OF MINUSCULE WHITE PHOSPHOROUS FLARES.</p><p>BEFORE LONG, THE GTIS AND I WERE ON THE MOUNTAIN ROADS, WHERE THE FAIRLANE IS IN ITS ELEMENT. IT BEGGED TO STRETCH ITS LEGS, PULLING IN TIGHT FOR INTIMATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WET MACADAM. I CELEBRATED THE DAWN BY RUNNING ONE OF THE GTIS INTO A GUARD RAIL, CATAPULTING IT INTO THE VALLEY BELOW.</p><p>AHEAD OF ME, TRAFFIC STOPPED SUDDENLY. THE EARLY-MORNING COMMUTER TRAFFIC PARTED ABRUPTLY AND I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING.</p><p>BOSCH HAD FOUND ME. I GUESS THEY GOT MY LETTER ABOUT CANBUS DATA FRAME SIZES. I LEANED OUT THE FAIRLANE’S WINDOW, ANGER AND NITROMETHANE FUMES BURNING MY EYES AS I PUNCHED THE TRANSMISSION INTO REVERSE AND BEGAN BOILING THE TIRES.</p><p>EIGHT BYTES ISN’T ENOUGH, MOTHERFUCKERS, I SCREAMED. I GOT THINGS TO SAY.</p>

<p>I hit the winch remote and pulled the Spirit through the rocky terrain, standing well aside in case the cable snapped or any one of a million unforeseen unfortunate occurrences were to happen. This far into the wilderness, any mistakes I made had to be the kind I could walk away from.</p><p>It was the third or fourth month; at first without cellphone towers, the clock on my $16 skull-shaped gongkai LTE phone began to drift, and finally, without a cigarette lighter adapter, the phone itself packed it in. It was difficult to tell exactly what time it is, is what I’m trying to tell you. I was near the former Rock Creek ski lodge, trying to haul my Spirit up the lip of a rocky dustbowl before the next pass of the scandrones could tag it. I was pretty convinced they could sample the air and zero in like a laser on the AMC’s specific fingerprint of noxious greenhouse gases in the exhaust as well, but I figured, perhaps foolishly, that they’d need a general area to search, lest it distract from their other targets. Either way, no time to lose.</p><p>I threw a large, flat rock under the Spirit’s inside rear wheel, hoping that the extra force would shove the rear axle on that side up just far enough to pole vault the rest of the rear end of the car forward through the magic of leaf springs. I was rewarded for my prudent analysis and rational application of physics with a grotesque grinding sound, as the Spirit neither rolled over nor lifted on the rock. In fact, it started to slide sideways and backwards down the lip, further from my goal than ever. I caught myself saying an involuntary prayer.</p><p>Suddenly, I heard the distinctive sound of two tractors having a marital relation in a filing cabinet. I turned to see a Subaru Outback, driven by a geriatric, trivially climbing the landscape behind my AMC, unperturbed even in the slightest at the brutality of it all.</p>

<p>The Justy screams at me as its tiny boosted three-cylinder spins its rotating assembly to the kind of speeds that in its birth era were only seen in F1 cars. I click the sequential Olsbergs transmission to the next gear, returning grip to the front end, and the rear end goes wide by comparison, putting it into an ass shimmy so violent I swear I can hear the clutches in the centre differential smacking together in a valiant effort to return the available grip to equilibrium.</p><p>An apex, a tight hairpin, rough logging roads: all fall before the Justy and I, our confidence in each other matched only by our inherent but hidden strength. I am filtering through the forest like white lightning now, imagining the appreciative cheers of rally spectators as they stand in the middle of the road to snap a selfie before jumping out of the way of my oncoming fender flares at a million kilometers per hour.</p><p>My homebrewed anti-lag system burbles and pops an angry tenor staccato through the minuscule exhaust as the street stage begins. Four more shifts and I’m there, so much heat pumped into the small rotors by the trip that the water-cooling system hisses, threatening to evacuate its liquid bounty onto the parking lot.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh hello?” I hear a soft voice from the curb. I have to crane my neck to look over, the peripheral vision blocked by my Bell rally helmet.</p><p>“Are you my Driving Seniors driver?” the voice asks.</p><p>I pre-stage launch control in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Purring like a kitten with a vacuum leak, the car gulped down a little extra air and nitromethane every time I tapped the gas pedal idly with my right foot. I was waiting for something, and a car like this doesn’t like to wait. If I’m honest with you, a man like me doesn’t like to wait either.</p><p>My duty commander had told us to take a look on the down-low at this warehouse down on the dock. It was suspected that they were carrying illicit, terrible merchandise, smuggling it in from distant locations that I could never visit on a patrolman’s salary.</p><p>I of course decided that the ideal vehicle for an undercover operation was a bright red ‘56 Plymouth Savoy station wagon with twin street scoops sticking out of the hood, slammed on tractor-wide tires and enough parking lot and ramming damage to keep a car restoration shop on TV until the apocalypse. My fellow officers had a lot of negative things to say about my appearance, the flash, the poise, the attitude, but they understood that I got results. Well, they would if I got results this time.</p><p>My thoughts were interrupted as I saw a suspicious Mitsubishi Fuso short-wheelbase box truck reversing down the alley outside of the warehouse.</p>

<p>The road straightens up ahead and I reflexively allow the RX7 to enter its native environment of full throttle, the furious 13B screaming to its incomprehensible redline. This bit of throttle steering helps tuck the rear end in, and the FC squats on its long-throw truck suspension, sliding the distorting Grabbers nearly to the solid white on the shoulder, past which marbles and doom await me.</p><p>I straighten out of the corner exit and pin it. As the RX7 climbs the hill out of the valley, the stunning Colorado sky peeks through the dense roadside forest. I’d have had more time to take in the sights were it not for the squadron of lifted piston-based Mazdas hot on my tail, their riders swinging grappling hooks and waving loaded piton guns out of their windows.</p><p>One strut-spacer-lifted NB Miata comes tearing at my quarter panel, and I can tell from the rumble alone that it is powered by some kind of ghetto-savaged carbed 350. Not really enough car to keep up with me, but enough to trouble me on the straights, and this was a long straight.</p><p>When I came to this sleepy town looking for a plot of land to buy up for my employer, I didn’t expect such a peculiar reception. I began to contemplate the potential reasons for a squadron of lifted piston-based Mazdas lying in wait. There were none. I was flummoxed, but I didn’t come unprepared.</p><p>I lift. The RX7 engine-brakes suddenly, confusing the Miata driver. He brakes too hard in response, accelerates back to pace my quarter panel, falls out of the torque peak.</p><p>I pull the red fabric strap on the drivers’ side door. The carbon-kevlar door skin pops open, flapping in the breeze. A steel ball bearing is instantaneously accelerated to near-<i>c</i> by the door-mounted railgun, and splits the Miata lengthwise in the blink of an eye. My dome light flickers, but I don’t need it to see the other Mazdas slowing down, preparing to retreat. I tug the door back closed and once again hit the throttle, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>My CB radio squawks. I can dimly make out the sound of an appreciative slow clap. I’ve won this battle, but who is doing this to me?</p><p>I see a service station, and decide to think about it while nervously refilling and checking my oil level so as to protect my precious side seals.</p>

<p>It was 1958 when I heaped the last shovelfull of dirt upon my old life. I paused for a moment, opened a beer, and then got up and became the head of GM powertrain engineering.</p><p>Even the magazines cottoned on to how strange it was that General Motors, an extremely conservative, insular organization, would open its kimono and allow in a foreign man with no work history and a name that didn&rsquo;t come up in the social security register. No mind, felt my betters, it was time for a new General Motors, one that wasn’t afraid to take on Volkswagen.</p><p>I sat in my opulent office in the Renaissance Centre and looked out over the bustling metropolis of Detroit. One day, I thought, I will burn this all down around me. That&rsquo;s when I heard a knock at the door, and turned in my office chair to see the intern standing there.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;Sir, there&rsquo;s been a problem in production. the latest engines don&rsquo;t make enough horsepower.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t need to hear any more. Nothing needed to be said. I rose from my desk, adopting the classic power pose, Arms outstretched, eye contact locked, and asked him to turn the lights off. A film projector dropped from the ceiling.</p><p>We both heard a jaunty jingle and then the words appeared on the wall:</p><p>JAM HANDY PRESENTS</p><p>THE WORLD OF SUPERCHARGING</p><p>Ayn Rand would be proud.</p>

<p>The worst part about rolling a car is that for whatever reason Spotify cuts out. I don’t know if it’s like my cell reception or the alignment of bluetooth ions or what, but the Lovin’ Spoonful bursts into a cloud of ear-piercing MPEG static for a split picosecond before the audio cuts out altogether.</p><p>Just kidding, I would never admit to listening to the Lovin’ Spoonful in public.</p><p>What actually happens is that my windshield collapses inward, the stock A-pillars giving way under the incomprehensible weight of the rest of the chassis suddenly pushing upon their corroded shell. Yep, I think, this car’s done, and throw a chunk of broken spark plug from what used to be the ceiling through the drivers’ side window.</p><p>I can hear the voice of reason start to drone on in my mind’s ear. I’ve gotten too far away from the garage, I think. A ‘58 Studebaker President really wasn’t the best choice after all for a car to enter into the illegal <i>touge</i> racing with. The common sense shakes out of my skull again when I catch a glimpse of the fine-ass Honda City 2 Turbo wheels fitted to the EG Civic that has pulled over to render assistance. Those things are fresh as fuck, I think, as I heft myself over the shattered frame of the Studie and climb atop it to survey the landscape.</p><p>The Civic owner is more interested in what he asserts is a comprehensive closed-head injury than in selling his wheels, even after I make a handsome offer. I give him my tastefully thick business card, which just has my name with “ODDITIES” scrawled beneath it in raised lettering. He’ll come around, I tell him, even as I grow faint and slump against the fender of his car.</p><p>As my vision darkens, the last thing I remember doing is eyeballing the backspacing. <i>Perfect</i>. A single tear rolls down my cheek.</p>

<p>The man from the EPA is super angry for some reason. He screams into my ear from miles away, unaware or uncaring of the miracle of modern technology that allows him to span such a distance with his rage. I clear my throat and start to explain myself.</p><p>You see, I say, the window air conditioner in my house started going on the fritz, and it was super hot. So what I did was, I called up the local supplier of mineshaft Roots blowers and had them put me together an intercooled gas job that would move three hundred and forty thousand cfm of air.</p><p>Again he begins to sputter, and I cut him off with a mention of how I applied for and received a technological innovation grant from the DOT and EPA each that not only granted me the right to purchase tax-free E85 in bulk at cost but a handsome sum of money that helped pay for the base plate and the bored and stroked Pontiac 474 mounted to my modest house’s roof.</p><p>It worked like a charm - my house was so cool the MDF-and-spit Ikea special bookcases would shatter at the slightest touch. At last, I was comfortable in this horrible July heat.</p><p>My neighbours complained, of course they would, who would be happy with having to listen to the sound of a 235 cam thumping away all day long as it runs in its peak operational range? Only every single red-blooded person who has ever been born. So I compromised. I hooked my Nest up to an electronic throttle body so the compressor would run only when it was needed. Once the complaints of deafness stopped rolling in, city hall stopped investigating me, but something in their report must have tipped the EPA off to my wanton disrespect of noise bylaws.</p><p>I conclude by sneering at his fascistic intent, and tell him that I will see him in the court of public opinion that is the local rice rocket message board.</p><p>“No,” he says finally, “that’s not why I’m calling, but thanks for the help. Apparently you also purchased 600 cases of chrome spray paint without a license?”<br/></p>

<p>My Century rolls to a stop at the end of the street, the automated pedestrian-interference radomes sweeping their slow arc beneath tinted glass. I step out of the car, and straighten my shirt collar and sleeves. It’s been a long trip, but I arrived in opulent comfort. Along the course of my voyage, kohai everywhere fell upon themselves to be noticed by me, but I paid them no heed. The Century wasn’t for the public to behold.</p><p>When I first came across this car, it wore obscure diplomatic flags, its torn and stained rear-seat lace curtains flapping in the breeze produced by the broken quarter panel glass. I prepared myself for the grim duty of sending it to the crusher, finding zero commonality with the harem of bagged-upon and rust-seized Toyotas I had already collected. But something inside the car told me to stay my hand. A flicker of hope rose inside my tight chest.</p><p>I quickly step to the door of an ordinary suburban house, perform my political rituals, myself being - it turns out - an extraordinary political animal. Emphasis on the animal. Cash is exchanged. Soft words are spoken, a conspiratorial whisper between allies. A simple, nondescript box is thrust into my arms and the door shuts abruptly. I pivot on my heel and return to the Century.</p><p>Over the years, I fixed this car up. I secured rare Japanese parts from the lavishly-appointed estate sales of dead diplomatic envoys, and once even negotiated with the Emperor’s personal motor pool in order to secure rare pieces of period trim. If they had car shows on this continent that would respect this fine piece of machinery, it would win Pebble.</p><p>The twin hood-mounted Hampton 12-71 blowers rattle a furious rage into their immaculately polished intake manifolds, using the once-delicate twelve-cylinder Toyota mill as a crude lever to enact torsional force on the subframe. I chuckle, and gently place the box upon the back seat.</p><p>Driving this far to pick up a replacement headlight for one of my many Subaru Justys isn’t cheap or easy, but at least it was comfortable.</p>

<p>They told me to give a TED talk but they didn&rsquo;t say what it had to be about. after hour seven of my extremely informative explanation of how the parking pawl mechanism functioned on the A727 Torqueflite, a man stood up from the crowd and screamed &ldquo;BOOOOOOORING.&rdquo; I had the TED talk guards execute him on stage.</p><p>I snapped my black turtleneck and returned to the stage, which reflected the light coming from the five-hundred-thousand lumen DLP projector pumping out pixel after perfect pixel of my plan for bike lanes.</p><p>“We will place the bike pilots into this electromagnetic railgun that accelerates them to near-<i>c</i> velocities.” I frown as I click to the next slide. “It is my understanding that the majority of bicycles are poorly maintained by their owners and use needle or - god forbid - <i>friction</i> bearings.”<br/></p><p>Another click. A grisly bicycle accident.</p><p>“This happened just now in the research laboratory. Someone didn’t torque the wheel nut properly on their Cannondale in order to survive the near-instantaneous acceleration to relativistic velocity.” Murmurs. “But they got to work really quickly.” Laughs.</p><p>Later that day, I would pose for the cover of Pedal Magazine. They were heralding me as a visionary, a man who could get bicyclists to work on time without them smelling like a dead man’s armpit in July.</p><p>At home, I heard the distinctive rustling of velcro against leaves. I rose from my chair, only to be gunned down by an extremist cyclist, still clad in full race wear. The pain was immense. I could feel my lifeblood slipping through my fingers as the world went faint. Is this how <i>Jesus</i> felt?</p><p>“Going slow is my <i>right</i>,” he shrieked, before pedalling off slowly, running a red light and being immediately run over by a Lexus RX350.<br/></p>

<p>It was April or August or something when they put me to work in the crematorium. I had been bouncing from job to job, not being able to find that perfect verve, where I could let my freak flag fly without catching a disciplinary hearing. The job placement agency decided that the best place for me was to work at this little old funeral home.</p><p>In previous weeks, the proprietor had passed away and been handled by his own employees, who were not confident in their own management skills. Somehow my resume had set off enough Bayesian filters to trigger getting onto a <i>good</i> watchlist for once, and I was called up.</p><p>I stepped in the front door and saw my new employees standing, dour-faced but hopeful, the promise of my arrival evident on their bright eyed young faces. They needed someone who had been in the shit to lead them in in the absence of their trusted, beloved former leader. I didn’t waste any time.</p><p>“Call Lingenfelter and get an LS9 put in that hearse out there,” I barked. “Our customers are dead, but they’re not <i>that </i>dead.”<br/></p>

<p>When I first got the Mach 1, I found out that doing a burnout would make the world outside seem to slow and tinge brown. One day I accidentally hit the launch control, and I saw everything slow to a complete stop and then go <i>backwards</i>. Trapped in the car due to my defective Takata eBay replica harness, I was unable to halt the process. When I had successfully kicked the under-dash fusebox loose and stopped whatever was happening, the eight-lane highway I was on had disappeared, replaced by a dirt road.</p><p>I drove the Mach 1 back to town, finding many stores missing and many fewer but inestimably more stylish cars. My trained eye couldn’t help but pick out tons of classics that were immensely valuable - was this some kind of Hemmings meet? Was I being catfished by the vintage car insurance agency for my callous disregard of authentic patina?</p><p>Before long, I had settled in with these people. Turns out it was 1955. I attended a local drive-in with the intent of showing postwar kids what nine hundred and seventy three wheel horsepower from the motherfucking future could do.</p><p>A man stood, put money into a payphone, yelled excitedly. “Bob, it’s your cousin Marvin. Marvin Lutz. You know that new sound you were looking for? Well, listen to this.” He held the receiver to the intake plenum of my twin-screw Roots supercharger, which ingested it and the cord immediately in a howl of detonation.</p><p>Angry people surrounded my car, wondering if it was some kind of Communist agitator plot to destroy America via street racing. I had these strange twinkling lights and green rectangles inside my car, they reasoned. I decided to beat a hasty retreat, and did, handily outrunning anything that local law enforcement could bring me.</p><p>I had to do a burnout in reverse in order to return to my own time, I figured, but I had chewed up the tires I came with driving on the minty new macadam roads. I drove to a local tire shop. The attendant was there. “One set of Mickey Thompson drag radials, my good man,” I said while leafing through my Velcro wallet for bills old enough to have existed at this time.</p><p>He turns to me. We lock eyes, and I know immediately that I am repaying some horrible karmic debt.</p><p>“What’s a radial tire?”<br/></p>

<p>Before me in traffic, I saw a blurple Fiesta ST with an Opposite Lock bumper sticker. I smiled, because I knew I had touched him.</p><p>I reached out over a million miles of fibre-optic cable and changed something inside him permanently, and I didn&rsquo;t even have to use the prodigious horsepower of my single-slammer testament to the necessity of paying attention in head gasket metallurgy class in order to do it. </p><p>I pulled alongside him at the light, caught his eye. He reacted with revulsion to my dented, rusted base-model Subaru. I just smiled, the widest, most ridiculous grin I could muster. I could see the panic in his eyes now - he knew that I knew.</p><p>Weeks later, I saw the Fiesta ST up on Kijiji. It was for sale, so the owner could buy more turbocharged K-cars. He claimed his wife had left him, that he was finally achieving his true purpose beneath the great magnet. He lived, he died, he lived again. He spoke of a structure that gave him purpose, a religious vision of harnessing man’s most awful cars to denormalize a soft-edged society in decline rotting from its impacted bowels outward.</p><p>I sent him an email asking if he would part out the Recaros.<br/></p>

<p>The 6262 screams as it force feeds copious amounts of air through the little two-liter. My front tires bark, just once, and then are annihilated in a grey haze that blots out the sun. On the dash, the radio crackles.</p><p>It seems that the other members of the local cruise meet have taken umbrage with my decision to stop my SRT4-swapped Dodge Rampage on the highway shoulder and hit the gas until parts of the body start to fly off. Through the tire smoke I see a Suzuki Cappuccino angrily waving a piece of my rocker panel at me. I point to him and then turn my hand into a thumbs-up. Keep it, I think, it’s a <i>trophy</i>.</p><p>I disengage the line lock, its solenoid thudding open like a gunshot, and the Rampage lives up to its name.</p><p>Within seconds we’ve reached the sleepy mountain resort community, and I celebrate another successful voyage by filling the Rampage’s bed with enough tire marbles to act as budget bedliner. As my doughnut around the central fountain’s cobblestone walkway concludes, I see the other attendees of the cruise meet rolling in, frustrated at their inability to catch or punish me in any real way for transgressions against the stance nation for which they stand.</p><p>I chuckle and bury the gas one more time. I hear a small explosion, and my drivers’ side fender flaps open uselessly, shorn from its rusted mounts. Then I see the belts from the tire flap onto my hood. Uh-oh.</p><p>Pushing the window net aside and lifting myself over the Rampage’s welded-shut drivers’ door, I uplift my palms in a gesture of friendship and fealty. Who wants to buy some Racelands and Monster energy drinks, I ask, motioning to the ski shop behind them.</p><p>Luckily, they take the bait, and afford me precious seconds to remove a stretched wheel from one of their stanced-out Mk3 GTIs before they can come back. NORAD is probably scrambling fighter jets right now, I think, as the Rampage triggers every fast-moving ground radar system in the mountains on my way back from the meet.</p>

<p>When they put me in charge of overseeing this campground and mixed-use recreational area, they told me to be on the lookout for gangs of street racers. Toughs. You know.</p><p>One sleepy July morning, I was roused from my semi-slumber by the sound of the red phone ringing. Red meant bad. Red meant impending or active threats in the park. I picked it up immediately. It was the Commissioner. He was commissioning me, like a DeviantArt user trying to get someone to paint Sonic the Hedgehog yellow and put him in a diaper.</p><p>Before long, I was on my feet, and the John Deere Gator 6x6 was in gear. My beloved steed, its fiber-reinforced-plastic fairings flapped in the wind as I snapped and popped my way through the underbrush. The brutal power of the 850cc four-stroke became all too apparent as the rear end stepped out over a rise, and only my deft stewardship of the steering wheel was able to force it back into line. Down, girl, I said, don’t kill us yet.</p><p>As I burst out of the bush into onto a mountain biking path, scattering Lance Armstrong cosplayers left and right, I caught a glimpse of my quarry. Street racers. In their bright red, yellow and turquoise blue glory.</p><p>I hit the deer sirens on the Gator. I figured it was close enough to a real siren. My sidearm shook in his hip holster.</p><p>“STOP,” I screamed, “REFRAIN FROM THIS UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY.”</p><p>It was sicker than I thought. A <i>Ford Festiva</i> meet. My head reeled.</p><p>Before the day was out, I’d received citations for bravery and internal affairs investigations, in equal numbers. It turns out that a man can only see so many channeled and chopped Ford Festiva road racers in one place before he goes mad.</p><p>Me, I’m just glad I got out of there before the next weekend’s Geo Metro meet.</p>

<p>I was starting to realize that I spent way too much time at the registry office when their new summer student greeted me by name despite never meeting me. I imagined a clumsily photocopied black and white security camera shot of myself, with something like “BEST CUSTOMER” or “KEEP HANDS AND ARMS AWAY” written in glitter gel pen underneath.</p><p>He looked at the computer, frowned, looked at me, looked back at the computer, frowned.</p><p>“I don’t know how to explain this,” he started to say, and I could swear I saw the twinkle of a tear beginning to form at the edges of his eyes. “There’s a limit of two hundred and fifty five registered cars on the registry system.”<br/></p><p>I looked at him, trying to suppress the dark fire of internal combustion that drove me forward just as it did the Vanden Plas waiting for a plate out in the parking lot.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, I’d like to register a corporation,” I smiled, taking from my burlap sack a stack of notarized and signed fleet title documentation, prepared weeks previous for just this very occasion. I had wondered at the time why the man who looked so much like myself had told me to prepare it before disappearing into thin air with his Mk3 Supra, but everything was falling into place now.</p><p>The Kijiji Singularity would not be delayed.<br/></p>

<p>Going around the table at Thanksgiving, the Brussels sprouts finally spur me into action. I tap my fork on the wine glass. “I have something to say,” I find myself speaking as I rise.</p><p>The look in my dad’s eyes, confirmation of all he had suspected of me coming to a head in this terrible family gathering. My mom, warmly supportive but blankly ignorant - probably willfully so - of the weight of the terrible burden that I carried on my shoulders.</p><p>“I like Chevys,” I said, the words tumbling out of my mouth like machine gun fire.</p><p>Then silence.</p><p>My mom begins to cry, softly at first, and then turning into body-wracking sobs as she buries her face in her hands.</p><p>My dad moves to comfort her, and looks at me and says, “it’s okay son, EMD makes some of our motive power, I can understand being tempted sometimes.”</p><p>My mom cries harder.</p>

<p>I retreated to the airplane hangar that held my now copious car collection. I involuntarily mimed triggering an angle grinder with my right thumb and forefinger as the huge garage door started to rise.</p><p>The hangar was empty, its contents raptured away by some unknown process. A karmic loop was closing, the enormous wheel of fate shifting on its slightly wobbly hub bearing as it latched down upon me.</p><p>A shimmering in the dead centre of the concrete pad caught my attention. I remembered the industrial real estate agent telling me it was built atop the intersection of two ancient ley lines, a true place of power.</p><p>Outside the hangar, lightning struck. I hadn’t even noticed a storm rolling in.</p><p>I turned to look at it, and when my gaze returned to the hangar, it was no longer empty.</p><p>My latest masterpiece was finally completed. They had told me it was impossible to merge a rolled Ford Raptor and a Porsche 944, but I showed them.</p>

<p>As I stare into the open throttle body of the Subaru, I hear in my mind’s ear the distinctive sound of a Weiand blower. It’s beautiful, and I start to cry.</p><p>Knocky (a 1998 Forester S) and I had been together for a relatively short period of time by this point. We never really understood each other, and he had an unfortunate combination habit of loose steering and pissing coolant on the ground that served to distance me further from him. Regardless, he was the one that was most operational when the Weiand came in, and he would receive this particular bribe. Perhaps it would push him further toward good behaviour.</p><p>A junkyard payment for a debt owed to me by one of my degenerate car buddies, I can only imagine how many people I had killed for him and forgotten about in order to deserve such a delightful forced-induction gift. I would sit in my study at night, sipping cognac and slowly spinning the drive pulley, listening to the rotors twirl and moan in the moonlight.</p><p>Before long, it was over, and I had what I hope is still the world’s only Roots-blower-equipped slammed Forester. I immediately departed for the local Subaru club’s wings meet, knowing its presence in the parking lot by the total absence of all Subarus save mine.</p>

<p>When I lived in California, I worked as a private investigator, taking cases at my leisure thanks to the custom of my wealthy benefactor. I drove a six hundred horsepower Ferrari 308 Quattrovalvole with twin blowers the size of a breadbox wailing down its throat. But there was a case that made me quit, in the end.</p><p>There would come a time in every single case when my employer of the moment would realize that no amount of their money put in my hand would give them the answer they truly wanted; only the answers that they feared. In many ways, I was more of a trusted third party who could confirm their powerlessness before the great machine of fate.</p><p>All this was fine; I had grown to expect it, in fact played a secret game of “Client Bingo” as I looked closely for their character development arc. This story is a little different, though. A local lawyer had hired me to track down witnesses to his client’s innocence in a small traffic matter. I didn’t need much more incentive than that, I thought, clutching the keys to the Ferrari.</p><p>No, there was more, he said, and I swear to this day he gave me a devilish grin as he delivered the news. You need to go undercover, they can’t know I hired you. Drive this rental Mitsubishi Mirage.</p>

COMPLICATED MATRICES OF INFINITE DENSITY, MERGING SUBARU WIRING HARNESSES BENEATH A SINGLE RICKETY INCANDESCENT LIGHT - AND THAT&rsquo;S WHEN I SEE THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEMS ROLL UP IN THE PARKING LOT.</p><p>MY PANIC ATTACK SUBSIDES IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS I SEE ITS BALEEN FLANKS SLIDE INTO MY FIELD OF VISION. I HESITATE TO USE DIFFICULT-TO-PROVE ADJECTIVES SUCH AS “PERFECT” TO DESCRIBE SUCH AN AUTOMOBILE, BUT IT WAS THE CLOSEST THING IN THE LOT.</p><p>A 1950 DESOTO WAS SITTING THERE, NOW, SLOWLY LEANING TO ONE SIDE AS THE SUSPENSION MOUNTING POINTS BEGAN TO BREAK FREE FROM THE FRAME. THE ONCE-IMPRESSIVE CHROME GRILLE WAS A MIASMA OF TOOTH DECAY AND RUST, A TETANUS THREAT SO IMMINENT THAT EVERY MOTHER FOR BLOCKS AROUND WAS CALLING THEIR CHILDREN INSIDE EVEN BEFORE CATCHING SIGHT OF THE VEHICLE. INDEED, THE CDC WAS LIKELY INVOLVED AT SOME LEVEL ALREADY.</p><p>THE CRYPTKEEPER DRIVING IT STEPPED OUT. HE PLACED A - COULD THIS BE REAL? - “FOR SALE” SIGN ON THE WINDSHIELD. I REACHED INSIDE THE FENDER LINER OF MY 1979 CAPRI RS. I THINK BOTH OF US WERE SURPRISED AT HOW QUICKLY I WAS UPON HIM, THRUSTING A PREVIOUSLY-UNSEEN RESERVE OF CAR-BUYING SMALL BILLS IN HIS FACE.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long until I became aware of the growing contingent of fans around my works. After I hit the top of the New York Times bestseller list, there was nowhere I could go as an author but down. Or was there?</p><p>It turns out that what actually happened was that I went <i>sideways</i>. Book clubs spontaneously formed around the breed of car guys most sympathetic to my unstructured and largely undiagnosed mental disorders. I would flick on CNN and hear that someone got arrested in Maryland wearing a crudely painted ballistic-ABS skull mask driving an Aston Martin Lagonda with a 4V53T under the hood, and laugh.</p><p>My butler in those times, a kindly man named Bailey, would always react with mock outrage that any people were following the actions of my fiction. Even with that, he would always smile as he threw me the keys to one of the truly awful testaments to mechanical engineering that I kept in my spacious bunker.</p><p>Pulling up to the book signing, I flared the throttle on the Scamp to throngs of applause, clapping even as they fled for cover from the beyond-the-visible-spectrum nitromethane fireballs burping out of the fender-mount exhaust. It was an uneventful signing, as far as those kinds of things go. Lots of people telling me I changed their life. One guy asked me if I would tattoo my signature on his kid. Security dealt with him particularly quickly.</p><p>On my way home, I found despite myself that I was drawn to a small neighborhood on the outskirts of the highway. At the end of the street, a small ramshackle house sat, with a single-car garage open to the elements. The flicker of fluorescent shop lights filled the street in front of it.</p><p>I stepped inside it, looked for the owner. On the jackstands was an Alfa Romeo Giulia. I couldn’t help myself, rolled up my sleeves and started to use the frame pick to knock out the chunks of rust around the quarter panel, the muscle memory of repairing rust in Italian cars. I should have known it was a trap, it was too perfect.</p><p>As I awoke, a burlap sack over my head, I could dimly make out my captors talking about how much they were going to get for me in ransom. I wasn’t worried, though. The sound of a twin turbocharged Pontiac mill filled my ears, and their fear filled my nose.</p>

YOU MEAN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD HIGHLY SUSPECT CARS, AS LONG AS THOSE CARS ARE ELECTRIC, I SCREAMED INTO THE RECEIVER.</p><p>YES, SCREAMED MY RIDDLER-COSPLAYING FREE MONEY EXPERT ACCOUNTANT, YES THEY WILL.<br/></p><p>MY IPO WAS STRATOSPHERIC, BUOYED BY GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND PRIVATE-INDUSTRY DONATIONS. THEY INVITED ME ONTO TELEVISION PROGRAMS TO SHARE HOW I WAS AN INNOVATOR, SAVING THE WORLD, FIXING THE ILLS OF MY GASOLINE-FUELED HEDONISM BY REPENTING ON BOWED KNEE BEFORE THE ALTAR OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IF THEY ONLY KNEW.

<br/></p><p>WITHIN HOURS I HAD MY FIRST PROTOTYPE VEHICLE. TWELVE HUNDRED POUNDS OF WET-LAID CARBON FIBER COVERED IN AN ARAMID CERAMIC ARMOUR TO PROTECT AGAINST DOOR DINGS. DARK, UNNATURAL SPIRES ROSE FROM THE VEHICLE, SO AS TO FURTHER DEMONSTRATE ITS DIFFERENCE FROM THE ANTIQUATED DINOSAUR-ASPIRATION SYSTEMS THAT ONCE UNDERPINNED MY INHUMANE TOOLS OF REVENGE.</p><p>I PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE 7-11, THE JACOB’S LADDER MOUNTED ON THE FRAME SNAPPING AN INCH-THICK ARC OF PURPLE LIGHTNING DOWN THE BODY AS THE CNC-MILLED PRECISION MAGNETO WELDED TO THE END OF THE FORGED TITANIUM CRANKSHAFT PASSED AN AIR GAP IN THE UNIBODY AND REACHED OUT FOR THE TASTIEST NEARBY GROUND.</p><p>THE GOVERNMENT-LICENSED PROTOTYPE VEHICLE LICENSE PLATE ROCKED GENTLY IN THE WIND, HASTILY TACK WELDED ON ONE CORNER TO THE MILD STEEL PUSH BAR ON THE REAR BUMPER.</p><p>ON THE WAY OUT OF THE 7-11, SLURPEE IN HAND, I NOTICED THAT A MAN IN A PT CRUISER SAT, TERRIFIED, HIS FACE LOCKED INTO A SILENT SCREAM. HE BROKE OUT OF HIS STUPOR AS I TURN THE MOTOR CONTROLLER’S DIAL FROM “TRACTION” TO “REVENGE” AND TURN THE MICHELIN HIGH ROLLING RESISTANCE AGRICULTURAL TIRES INTO A HAZE OF RAW RUBBER.</p><p>I LOVE SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>

<p>Coming to the door of the tomb in which I had fallen, I shoved the rockfall aside with great effort and stepped out, bloodied, silk dress shirt torn, into what turned out to be a highway parking area.</p><p>Seeing me, a girl dressed like a 1970s Tom Baker - the fashion at the time, I assumed - fell on her ass and scooted backwards, screaming in half-understood high pitched Japanese. She covered her face so as not to make eye contact with my visage, not wanting to share in my burden.</p><p>The dust started to clear. The earthquake sirens were still going off, and the adrenaline-comedown shaking that started in my arms had reached my knees. I felt faint, but I struggled onward through the cloud of rubble dust, in search of rationality, a concrete basis on which to pin my future hopes and dreams.</p><p>It must have been quite a sight for the PT Cruiser Touge Club when I emerged from the gently-burning cloud of concrete ash into their parking area. The survivors were already overwhelmed with caring for the dead and dying, and the return of what I was now determining to be the true source of their discomfort inflicted an additional psychic wound that popped the human equivalent of many of their head gaskets.</p>

<p>When I woke up from my nap, the PT Cruiser was gone and so was Soichiro. I didn&rsquo;t need them after all, I thought, brushing the rubble from my prone body.<br/><br/>The Japanese earthquake alarms were still blaring, their polite alternating-tone emissions making it seem like my train was about to arrive. I wondered how long I had been under, but realistically a 20-25 minute gap in the middle of my day wasn&rsquo;t unheard of. How far had I come that this was becoming normal?<br/><br/>Crossing the demolished room, I started tonight&rsquo;s episode of CSI. Like many before it, the plot was predictable. I knew that I was the perp, but I didn&rsquo;t know quite yet what I had <i>done</i>. You see, ever since the HHR I had these, uh, I guess you could call them blackouts. But that&rsquo;s not quite right either.<br/></p>

<p>Decades later, I was now a successful businessman. Taking initiative of my mental state, controlling outcomes, altering how fate would treat me, those were skills that my sheltered suburbanite education had buried. I was to live in a soporific haze of Netflix and increasingly higher quality footwear.</p><p>As the HHR broke me, I felt something snap deeper below. Now that we&rsquo;re talking about it, I assume that&rsquo;s must have given way that time.</p><p>My plane banked sharply on its approach to Narita, probably dealing with thick rush hour traffic. I felt a bit of sympathy for the pilot, whose day job must have consisted of glorious freedom followed by stop and go traffic thirty thousand feet in the air. Sort of like mine, I laughed darkly to myself, working the accent stitching of my cashmere suit sleeve&rsquo;s cufflink. They - always they, I thought - sent me here to solve problems, and solve problems I did.</p><p>Stepping out of the airport, I saw my handler holding a laser-printed sign indicating the name I had given him. I asked for the car.</p><p>He pointed somewhere into the background, and all I could see was a darkened haze in the rain-and-neon-soaked streets of Tokyo. Some part of the contour - glimpsed dimly - made my heart race in fear.</p><p>&ldquo;I figured you would like something exotic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep you from getting homesick. They call it a PT Cruiser. Very rare here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From my perspective there were few options left, and my time to execute them was dwindling. I looked out the window of my rented 2-bedroom apartment, now emptied, my wife having fled upstate with our - hers, now? - children. She said she didn&rsquo;t recognize me anymore. It was pouring rain, a normal aspect of those slow summers of the Pacific Northwest. My knee ached.</p><p>I got in my car, a worn out Yaris sedan, and started to drive east. Before long, a Nevada highway patrolman was on me. He shone his flashlight into the window, saw my dilated pupils, started to ask more interesting, more relevant questions. Was I on drugs, was this my car, where are the kids that go in those car seats, the usual cop rigamarole.</p><p>As the officer prepared to write a ticket, he received an officer-down call from nearby, and sped away, lights strobing. I foolishly took this as a good omen, a kind of divine intervention, for my mission. The Yaris trucked onward, its mismatched front fender an identifying mark just stark enough to keep my mind occupied.</p><p>When we arrived in Detroit, I realized it was different from how they had famed it. Somehow, it was dirtier. Worse. There was a relentless Debbie Downer attitude that leaked from the pores of the town, and surely caused such a hateful beast as The Cruiser to be forged by otherwise decent men. I would plead my case to one of them now. I would ask him to destroy them all for me. No. For humanity.</p><p>I pulled into Bryan Nesbitt&rsquo;s driveway and walked up the sidewalk to ring the doorbell. It was then that I saw it, through a side window in the garage.</p><p>He had done it again.</p><p>And just like Satan in my dark mid-July fever dreams, now it wore a bowtie.</p>

<p>After the PT Cruiser incident, life was never quite the same. Food turned to ash in my mouth, and the laughter of my children rang hollow in my ears as I realized they shared the world with such an impure cosmic force, puppets to its foul machinations. A part of my being tried to break out from this funk, but it was unable to find much purchase in the world of the real. Or what I interpreted as real.</p><p>One early Saturday morning, I dropped an Altima Coupe on the alignment rack and began to work the drivers&rsquo; side tie rod lock nut in a blind haze, the muscle memory all that was keeping the husk of my body moving forward. My boss had been standing over me, yelling, for what he claimed was hours. I didn&rsquo;t notice. My conscious mind had retreated into a corner, in the fetal position, gripping its knees and gently rocking, hoping its crude abuser would never return.</p><p>I heard him say suddenly - &ldquo;PT Cruiser&rdquo; - and I was on him like lightning. I elevated the inner tie rod wrench over his head like an ape at the zoo preparing to smash a melon, and from what he later said in deposition I glowered at him, eyes so dark he could glimpse one transitory fragment of my pain. It scared him. It scared me that it scared him. Suddenly I could smell urine, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was still the customer&rsquo;s car.</p><p>I released my grip, and lowered myself, placing my back against the Altima Coupe&rsquo;s nineteen inch alloys, feeling the rough texture of the curbing against my neck. I began to sob.</p>

<p>I was a normal man, once. I had reasonable desires, I felt empathy for my fellow man. I could identify the beautiful parts of a sunset and seeing the faces of my children brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>All that changed one night.<br/><br/>At the time, I was working in a hole in the wall repair shop in the bad-immigrants part of town, trying to make enough money to hit my rent payment. Maybe if I racked up enough hours, I hoped every time I talked to Tim, our &ldquo;pit boss&rdquo; - little Firestone joke there - I could even buy my kids one of those Gameboys or something. I was so innocent then.<br/><br/>A guttural metallic shudder, like the warning sign of a rattlesnake, swept up the block. Some part of my subconscious knew before I could comprehend, a survival trait passed down from my ancestors to keep me safe. But we lived in a modern era, where predators were gone. The rational part of my brain took over, made me stand my ground, made me look like a man. I wish I had listened to my lizard brain.<br/><br/>A 2002 PT Cruiser Limited rolled into the parking lot. The owner stepped out, and the faux-hot-rod styling shook on its moorings as the overstressed 2.0L DOHC dieseled itself to an uneasy sleep. I can still remember the sound those razor-sharp heat shields made now.<br/><br/>Detective, you had a chance to stop me shortly after all this happened. I tried to turn myself in.<br/></p>

<H1>The Postman Always Rod-Knocks Twice</H1>
<p>A man I used to hang out with once said that a rotary engine was like a pump for turning dead dinosaurs into noise and not much torque. He was half right, I thought, as I lit up the mountain road.</p><p>In those days, I was a quality-control engineer for a small mining operation, and part of my job involved taking visits to distant rural neighbourhoods and evaluating them for purchase. The people who lived here, they’d have a bad roll at the roulette table, fall sick, over-leverage their homes, any one of a million things, and sell the family birthright to my employer as a step of last - or sometimes first - resort.</p><p>My job was to drive down the hundreds of dirt roads stretching across the state, like the spidered glass in a windshield after you hit a pedestrian, to visit these unfortunates during the worst days of their lives. And for that job, I needed something a little different. A little stranger. It wouldn’t do to turn up in just another corporate-stickered F150, they’d take you for a sucker, size you up as an agent of the corporation. I needed relative anonymity, but in a way that let me get my personality across.</p><p>My vessel of choice was a baby shit brown ‘87 RX-7 GXL, dug out of a scrapyard a decade previous and nursed back to health with a combination of my good taste and not knowing how to quit a lost cause. It was lifted three inches on subframe spacers and a further two inches on retrofitted Rancho twin-tube long-throw truck suspension, which gave what was left of the RX7 a menacing, war-torn appearance even before they noticed the piecemeal Grabbers beneath it, the tread lugs alternatingly cut out of the tire to give me that extra little edge on snow and ice. Huge xenon rally lights sat atop a chicken-wire-and-DOM pushbar and drew the eye away from the admittedly-undersized ATV winch bolted to it.</p><p>Coming around the last bend before the town, I dropped the long-throw gas pedal to the rapidly vibrating floorpan and was rewarded with the sound of a ball-bearing turbocharger racing to the moon as it force-fed the howling Dorito beneath the all-too-vented hood. The power bulge caught the edge of the morning sun just right, and I found myself blinking my eyes to clear sun blindness. All at once, the town of Sedalia unfolded before me, its main street straight as an arrow past the law offices of the man I was to visit. I could hear the General Grabbers start to howl against broken asphalt as the road surface switched from what the state government generously termed “unimproved” to what the town government generously termed “improved.”</p><p>As I pulled up to the town’s sole law office, I couldn’t help but catch a side glimpse in the gravel parking lot. That’s weird, I thought. That couldn’t have been a lifted Miata, could it?</p><p>But then I could hear it. Pistons. All around me.</p>

<p>I engage the remote door popper and wait for the sickening crunch of metal to reach my position. Years ago when I bought this Mercedes, I refused to repair the idiotic vacuum locks, and instead shaved the door and installed poppers. But yet, little girly fifty-pound door poppers for your mom’s Golf 4 weren’t enough for these massive heavy doors, and I was forced to upgrade. A trip to Princess Auto resolved that quickly enough.</p><p>With 1,800 pound hydraulic rams installed, the Grosser’s doors technically qualified as an area denial weapon under the Geneva Convention, and I was putting the theory into practice this frosty February morning.</p><p>A clap of thunder rocks the parkade, setting off nearby car alarms and causing angry owners to get up from their dinner tables.</p><p>The Journey next to the Grosser lies in ruins, its front subframe shorn from its moorings as the latter half of the unibody collapsed away from it. Seeing the waves of the finest American steel undulate across the frame does something horrible to me, and I blink to clear the rising tide of what I can only dimly identify as the flickers of my conscience. Somehow the windshield has popped fully intact from the collapsing A-pillars and lies immaculate on the hood, a silent witness to the lesson taught today.</p><p>Only I get to ding my doors.</p>

<H1>Saturday Classics: Megaton Crisis on Infinite Earths</H1>
<p>When I first enlisted in the military, they told me that as part of my enlistment package I could choke two horses to death. I was halfway through choking the first one to death when I got a phone call. It was my shift supervisor, Mr. Emery, telling me that I was late for my job at the meat packing plant.</p><p>I got back into my car, at that point a 1989 Toyota Cressida with riveted-on orange panels from another Japanese compact saloon, and drove to the meat packing plant. Emery was waiting for me when I walked in to punch in for my shift. When I joined the military, they told me that I couldn’t ever tell anyone, not ever, about what I was doing for them. I had no excuse for Emery.</p><p>“Why are you so God damned late, you child-killing fascist?” asked the irascible Emery.</p><p>I refused to respond, merely staring into his eyes and feeling the rage grow inside me. I walked past him, saying nothing, and headed to my spot on the floor.</p><p>A bit of background: where I work in the plant, an iron grate is built into the floor in order to allow entrails of fresh-hewn meat to sluice through to the recycling/retainment bin. Occasionally, one of my pieces of costume jewelry would drop through and get caught in the byproducts bin, and then get sold to foreign meat markets. I honestly had no idea how many people had eaten my gold-plated plastic snake toe rings, but I figured it was more than “a few.” It didn’t matter; I was in the military now, and the only corporate malfeasance I cared about came from my subcontractor, Halliburton Death-Murder Patrol, Incorporated, a proud division of Halliburton Ethnic Cleansing LLC.</p><p>I pulled my hazard-orange iPod Classic from my webbed belt holster and set it to playing the best hits of the 1980s. The dulcet tones of the Pet Shop Boys filled my ears as the meat I was set to inspect began to slobber down the conveyor belt in front of me, triggering memories of my childhood. My dad was a coroner, you see, and so he would occasionally bring his work home with him, his briefcase bulging with postmortem amputated limbs and his glasses caked with the spray of overwork and the pride of a job well done. I was so envious of that commitment to work.</p><p>So there were these two big issues about work, I don’t know if I mentioned them earlier. The first big issue was that I was paid less than shit, which is why I went to work for Halliburton. The second big issue was named Steve, and he was a serial killer. We used to call him Evil Steve, and the glint in his eye always reminded me of that Halloween night when I fell into a snowbank and didn’t get rescued until the following April. Steve came downstairs from his position at the manager’s office, fixed me with his gaze, and then began to scream. They weren’t words so much as unintelligible screaming, but it was enough to set me off, and I turned on my heel to face him.</p><p>That’s when the lunch bell rang, and I broke for lunch. Still wearing my gore-stained meat working uniform, I walked to the Arby’s next door and ordered a platter of their El Mexicano Deluxium™ nachos, which always served to sate my hunger. You see, these nachos, I knew, used my meat byproducts as a base, and I was always personally very proud of them. This didn’t impress the many women I took to Arby’s on dates, however, so it never really helped my love life all that much.</p><p>I finished bolting down the rest of the Deluxium™ platter and then headed out to the parking lot, where I saw Steve parked in his clapped-out, navy blue 1986 MR2 Supercharged. It was missing its entire front grille and both hubcaps on the left hand side, and he was crying to himself, his head in his hands, with a platter of my nachos in his lap. It seems he had finally found the other piece of not-quite-costume jewelry I had lost last week.</p>

<p>The pain in my side was incredible. I slid my back across the dented nerf bars of the Discovery, leaving a trail of thick blood in my wake.</p><p>It was a long time ago, and we were in Oman, handling a small squabble between local political leaders. At some point the small squabble had evolved to a full on insurrection, and mercenaries swooped down upon the country. Lord Shaftesbury and I were dispatched to take care of it. I felt an obligation to support the old man - in my youth, he was the one who saw something others didn’t, picked me out of an orphanage, put a gun in my hand.</p><p>Things went sideways pretty much immediately as we arrived at a small village on the shores of the Batha river, seeking a local militia to form into a serrated spearhead capable of brutal violence. The town mayor clearly didn’t like foreigners showing up in his sphere of influence, especially ones with damaged faces and dog-eared passports doubling as conflict-zone souvenir scrapbooks. Regardless of his opinion, the local reservoir was a tactically important zone and we took the political, civil and fiduciary liberties to secure it.</p><p>A couple weeks into - I still don’t like to call it an <i>occupation</i>, no matter what Wolf Blitzer says - our job, we had taken our ramshackle Land Rover down a once-forested, now-craggy trail to check in on a labour leader who had told us he learned of the rebellion’s nearby positions. This was the break we were looking for, and both of us were on high alert. If we weren’t, what came next would have been much worse.</p><p>I knew that the man who had set the trap for us was in the canopy above, most definitely with a high powered rifle trained on the opposite side of the Disco from me. The thin British sheet metal wouldn’t protect me from a direct hit, but from his angle he had little chance of figuring out exactly where I was. A warning shot rang out, punching the corroded front fender like an angry gorilla making a documentary. Two more, and then, one past my shoulder. Then silence. I had precious seconds in which to work, but was that magazine truly empty?</p><p>I pulled a road flare from the drivers’ footwell of the Discovery through one of its new exit wounds and threw it onto the ground, hoping to confuse any computer-aided scopes while I ran in the exact opposite direction. One more vicious shot rang out, dimpling the ground next to the flare. My ruse worked, and I was able to escape my immediate predicament.</p><p>Now that I could see the passenger side of the Discovery, I knew Shaftesbury was certainly dead. He hadn’t moved for several minutes now. I felt a deep pang of guilt, one I still carry today. Everything could have been different, but now was not the time to focus on that.</p><p>After several more minutes of tense agony, I was in the forest canopy with my sidearm drawn against the flat spot of the shooter’s skull. He began to laugh, a scraping, broken cackle, and without concern for his survival slowly turned to face me, my pistol scraping and bounding across his forehead as he did.<br/></p><p>Mel Gibson. I should have known.</p>

IT&rsquo;S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO EXPAND MY CREDIT PORTFOLIO, I TELL HER, BECAUSE MY #1 EXPENSE IS SPRAYPAINTING HORSE TEETH WITH GOLD KRYLON BEFORE EPOXYING THEM ONTO A RESPIRATOR.</p><p>IT IS AT THIS MOMENT SHE AT LAST MAKES EYE CONTACT, AS SHE WAS TRAINED TO DO, FIGHTING EVERY NATURAL INSTINCT PROGRAMMED INTO HER FROM MILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION. MY BATHROOM MIRROR AND I BOTH KNOW WHAT SHE SEES THERE.</p><p>SHE LOOKS AT ME WITH PURE HORROR, JAW DROPPED IN A GUT-WRENCHING SCREAM THAT CAN NO LONGER REGISTER IN THE FUNCTIONAL OCTAVE RANGE OF MY TYMPANIC MEMBRANE. MY MIND IMMEDIATELY PATTERN-MATCHES THE SPECIFIC EXPRESSION AGAINST MY ENDLESSLY DEEP DATABASE OF HUMAN REACTIONS AND FILES IT NEXT TO GHOSTLY IMAGES OF BROKEN FLEXPLATES.</p><p>MY SOCIAL REGRETS ALWAYS COME TO ME IN THE CAR, WHICH IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO PUT THEM OUT OF MY MIND BY SPINNING ANOTHER COUPLE THOUSAND REVS ONTO THE HAGGARD LS7 DRIVING THE REAR WHEELS OF MY BOMBED-OUT &lsquo;76 SAFETY-ORANGE ASTON MARTIN VANTAGE.</p><p>THE OFFICER WHO PULLS ME OVER THIS TIME DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE WORDS, AN INTERROGATION FOR ME. WHEN THE WINDOW ROLLS DOWN AND HE SEES MY FACE, HE JUST SCREAMS &ldquo;HOLY SHIT&rdquo; AND HURLS HIS TICKET BOOK AT ME. I LOOK ON IN SHOCK AS HE DIVES BEHIND HIS OUTSTRETCHED DRIVERS&rsquo; SIDE DOOR, VOCALIZING A VIBRANT PRAYER TO THE EFFICACY OF KEVLAR DOOR CARDS.</p><p>BEFORE LONG THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY LOOKS LIKE A CROWN VICTORIA CLUB MEET, INCLUDING THE DOUCHEBAG WITH THE FAUX-HAWK DOING POWERSLIDES. HE POPS HIS HEAD UP ABOVE HIS DRIVERS&rsquo; SIDE DOOR AS WELL, INTRODUCING HIMSELF AS DETECTIVE ERIKSEN AND ASKING ME HOW MY DAY IS GOING.</p><p>I CRANE MY HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW AND SMILE, SWITCHING METAPHORICAL GEARS TO THE FULL HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE AS I SWITCH LITERAL GEARS TO SECOND AND PRE-WARM THE CARBON FIBER CLUTCH AGAINST THE ENGINE’S LOPEY IDLE.</p>

<p>I ziptie the trigger down on the can of Febreze and hurl it through the closed drivers’ side window, shattering it into a million pieces. The hissing starts before it even hits the seat. Greek Seaside, I think. A classy choice.</p><p>When I first got out of prison, my parole officer asked me what I was going to do with my life. I told him something to do with cars. He frowned, and reminded me about the very tightly bound stipulation in my parole that I am not to own or operate any motorized vehicle producing greater than seventy-five brake horsepower. So my options were basically autocross superstar, or interior detailer.</p><p>The detailing shop pit boss, Trent, seemed pretty amenable to the concept of hiring me and my ex-con ways, but was sure to mention that he would be docking my pay a bit “to make sure I’m bondable.” I rolled my eyes, but accepted the job anyway. It was hard backbreaking work cleaning all the nooks and crannies of cookie-and-crayon laden Caravans, RX350s and crew-cab pickup trucks, but I went home at the end of the day to my one-bedroom apartment, satisfied with myself at having performed eight hours of honest work. Honest work, not like the before time.</p><p>I was halfway through scrubbing a carpet on a Tuesday morning when I got a call. It was Trent, and he was trapped across town after having made a customer pick-up. The car had broken down on the way back to the shop, and he needed a lift. He asked me to take the GT-R so he could get back to work quickly. I mentally flashed back to my parole officer.</p><p>Arriving at the scene, I found a Dodge Avenger drooling all of its coolant onto the road from a shattered lower radiator neck. Hit a rock, or an egret or something. Trent was livid, said I didn’t get there fast enough in the Mitsubishi kei truck we used to ferry detailing supplies around the back forty of the shop. Wanted to dock my pay some more.</p><p>On the entire way back to the shop, which was a fairly long period of time, Trent railed on me about his anger at my incompetence, my criminal behaviour, and the like. I was just about fed up, but was keeping it together. Then he threw his burning cigarette butt out the window.</p><p>I hit the brakes so hard the little Minicab lifted the rear end completely off the ground. Trent tumbled forward on the crude bench seat, striking the windshield. Started screaming at me, something indecipherable I could no longer hear through my red haze. Eventually we came to an agreement on my future employment.</p><p>“A real man doesn’t need more than seventy-five horsepower,” I said to Trent, “this electric winch is &frac12; HP and still seems to be doing a great job on your mouth.”<br/></p>

<p>In the morning, I would often peruse the local Kijiji and Craigslist for ads written by drunks. Often they had posted their cars in a furious spate of regret, and I could sometimes snap my way through their hangovers to pick up the cars. But there was something odd happening.</p><p>I saw a series of WTB ads for cars that I had found eminently desirable but had never admitted to my significant other. Pretty much all of them were written in all caps, demanded salacious exposure of these hot automobiles to the ad writer. Described things in words, terminology, phrasing that seemed oddly familiar.</p><p>I started asking around, dropping hints in normal conversation with my car-guy friends, but those tastes were too freakish even for them. Laughs, people slowly backing away, mockery at the idea of owning a triple-supercharged RB26 Delorean. We had ourselves a genuine mystery on our hands, and I was going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>I hadn’t been sleeping very well lately, a problem which I ascribed to the heat. One night I stayed awake all night, stirring in bed, back and forth. That morning, no WTB ads. I felt - oddly - lonely, like someone who truly understood me was gone as well. I didn’t put two and two together until later.</p><p>When the ads reappeared, I called the number immediately. I felt like I could turn this into a social call, get at least a tour of the guy’s garage, maybe some spare parts. No sooner did I push the green talk button, than I heard a strange sound. Following it to its source, I uncovered a heretofore-unknown Nokia tucked in the back of the couch, with hundreds of SMS messages on it. Creeped out, I put the phone back, but set out some improvised Lego caltrops in order to catch the interloper.</p><p>That night, I awoke standing in the middle of my own living room, reaching into the couch for the hidden Nokia, a stabbing pain in my foot. I was acting unconsciously on my secret fetishistic desires, something that the doctors later coined as car-guy sleepwalking.</p><p>It was chilling to think that my desire for odd cars was driven entirely by my limbic system, occasionally flaring to the conscious level and becoming actionable, but uncontrollable and aggressive beneath the surface. How could it be that there was something deep and reptilian roaming my mind that came out when my mind retreated into slumber at night? My thoughts raced, trying to connect the dots of weird occurrences and coincidences around the house that were now flatly explained by a plethora of hard evidence.</p><p>I looked out my front window and saw a lifted Mk2 Escort that I didn’t recognize idling in the driveway, its massive halogen beams burning the dust in my front foyer. Across the rear quarter window, in all caps, was a greasepaint sign reading “THE VOICE.”</p><p>That’s when I heard the sirens. My vision dimmed at the corners, and I felt faint.</p>

<p>I PUSH MY WAY THROUGH A THRONG OF POWER BUSINESSMEN ANGERED THAT THEY ARE STUCK IN THE SOCIALIST PARADISE OF COACH CLASS AND MAKE MY WAY TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TAKE UMBRAGE IN MY ACTIONS BUT THEY CANNOT STOP ME BEFORE I POP THE PROTECTIVE SEAL ON THE CARGO HOLD AND DESCEND BELOW DECKS.</p><p>THE REPTILIAN OVERLORDS CONTROLLING OUR GOVERNMENT HAD NO IDEA THIS IS COMING, I THINK AS I PEEL BACK THE PROTECTIVE BUBBLE WRAP ON THE PALLET. BENEATH IT IS MY VINTAGE IMPORTED DODGE BOULEVARD 3700 GT, A HELL BEAST SENT FROM AN ALTERNATE DIMENSION CALLED YOO-ROP.</p><p>MY BOULEVARD AND I HAVE A QUICK CONVERSATION THAT BASICALLY CONSISTS OF ME PUNCHING THE CARBURETOR IN THE FLOAT BOWL UNTIL THE FUCKING THING UNSTICKS. AFTER OUR DISCOURSE, I MASSAGE THE GAS PEDAL UNTIL THE BOULEVARD LEAPS FORWARD, RIPPING THE TOW HOOKS OUT OF THE CARGO HOLD’S TINNY CARAPACE AND ERUPTING FROM THE CARGO LOADING DOOR.</p><p>AS THE BOULEVARD DROPS THE LAST FEW HUNDRED METERS TO THE EARTH, I HAVE A SHORT MOMENT TO REFLECT UPON THE COURSE OF MY LIFE UP TO THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. I FIND NOTHING WANTING, AND GRAB MY RESTRAINT STRAPS SO AS TO AVOID KNOCKING MY HANDS AGAINST THE INTERIOR CAGE WHEN THE NOSE FINALLY HITS.</p><p>FREE ON THE TARMAC, I LIGHT UP THE BOULEVARD’S REAR TIRES AND SWERVE INTO A RENTAL CAR LOT. THIS WILL LOSE THE NORMALS, I BELIEVE, AS THEY SEEM INCAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING NOT ONLY TRIM LEVEL BUT <i>MAKE AND MODEL</i> AT A GLANCE. I FIND THAT INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT, WEAVING PAST A LOT OF OTHER GREY MID-SIZE CARS THAT THE RENTAL ATTENDANT WILL IDENTIFY AS IDENTICAL TO MINE.</p><p>AS ALWAYS, I HAD COME HERE TO SETTLE THE SCORE, BUT ENDED UP MARKING UP NEW ONES ALONG THE WAY. NEVER MIND, I THOUGHT, PUNCHING THE THROTTLE ON THE BOULEVARD AND LISTENING TO ITS CACAPHONY OF LOOSE-ROD-BEARINGED V8 RESPOND IN A FURIOUS RATTLY BELLOW.</p><p>FAST AND THE FURIOUS 9 WAS OPENING, AND I WAS LATE FOR MY RESERVED TICKETS.</p>

<p>I was a different man when I had that old S-10.</p><p>The year was 1999, and I was full of hope. My trusty Chevy S-10 SS and I got into all kinds of scrapes and adventures with Johnny Law and Timmy TruantOfficer-LockerSearches. Eventually the frame rot and road salt caught up with it and I had to sell it for $900 to an out of town drifter that turned out to be my dad, but that’s a story for another time.<br/></p><p>This story, you see, is about what it takes to be a man. The S-10 wasn’t enough on its own to guarantee entry into the hallowed halls of true manhood. I would light it up on my small town’s only major cosmopolitan boulevard, feel like a big hero, but there was always someone with a bigger truck. Someone with a louder exhaust, one of them Magnaflows. But the quest persisted, often in odd ways.</p><p>One of the oddest ways I encountered was that of my friend Shifty Mike, who was a convenience store thief. He hadn’t upgraded to purestrain armed robbery yet - that would come a few years later, when I would dimly recognize his older face in the daily newspaper - but he was definitely competent at pickpocketing the entire candy aisle and escaping, nudie mags flapping out of his back pocket as he jumped into his rotten ‘64 Chrysler Imperial Crown and laid thick black elevens on the chew-stained macadam of the 7-11. Either way, I figured he had a lot to teach me about being a man, and I hesitantly agreed when he offered to take me hunting one crisp April weekend.</p><p>It was deer season, I remember, and I had Shifty Mike’s sixteen gauge shotgun, loaded with what I assumed at the time to be birdshot, but in reality was probably something more on the order of home defense Hevi-Shot, designed to protect your pumpkins and a man’s dignity. I steeled myself to wait, to claim a life, to become a man as my ancestors had once done.</p><p>The thing nobody tells you about hunting is that it’s incredibly boring. A few hours of waiting in the tree stand, and I was singing my favorite Rush lyrics to myself, half-remembered, in a sort of haze of pure boredom, the kind of which would be unimaginable in today’s smartphones and tablets age.</p><p>I heard a rustle. Then a banging. Then an explosion. I leapt from the tree stand and ran in the general direction, panting. This is where the action would be, I imagined, this is where I would get my man badge.</p><p>I saw Shifty Mike lying on his back, jacket half on fire, next to an invisibly burning methanol distillery. Fucking asshole had been making moonshine this entire time while pretending to be out on a hunting trip, and he’d duped me into standing guard near it, expecting his rival moonshiners to be scared off by the sight of an orange vested teenager one-handing a poorly made Chinese shotgun out of a tree stand. The plan was brilliant for Shifty Mike, even if it didn’t exactly move the needle on supervillain plans.</p><p>That’s when I had my epiphany.</p><p>Manhood, you see, was about exploiting the fears of others.</p><p>It was with that knowledge that I returned to the S-10 sitting forlornly in the parking lot of a nearby trailhead. I would show them all. I would build <i>more cars</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wondered why they picked me for the job of head designer at one of the world’s most esteemed car companies. I wonder more frequently why they let me keep the job after I unveiled the Apex Predator.</p><p>I had reasoned, in initial design meetings, that what people really wanted was a car that was absolutely, unreasonably <i>batshit</i>. My boss nodded at every comparison to straight-blade shaving, running chainsaws one-handed without a guard, firing TEC-9s with the safety filed off in public debates for emphasis, and five-finger fillet. He even agreed with my overarching technical decisions. Before long, we discovered that his agreeable state was due to a combination of amyl nitrate and grain alcohol, but by then the product was on its way to dealerships.</p><p>The reviews were brutal. Consumer Reports claimed it was “undriveable” and the installation of a traction control system that only profanely taunted you in a synthesized voice before allowing you to crash was not going to endear it to the majority of American consumers. But I wasn’t looking for the majority of American consumers.</p><p>In the end, what the Apex Predator did was allow me to identify my fellow deviants, stepping out from their five-person message boards, Princess Auto parking lots and angle grinder collections into the bright sunlight, blinking in admiration while craning their necks to grab a vision of Detroit’s acknowledgment that they were okay. They were accepted. They were loved.</p><p>But it also let the government know about those deviants. A month after the first Apex Predator burst its way through a crowded suburban shopping mall, ripping a series of staccato misfires as the mandatory anti-lag kept the turbocharger on the boil, they clamped down and sent everyone with their names attached to a VIN to a special blacksite prison in Cuba.</p><p>I’m still sorry about that, you guys. But the traction control didn’t work.</p>

Before long, the street scoop atop my 6-71 blower was force feeding honeybees into the hungry three-lobe rotors, causing momentary detonation. It was worth it, though, as the Scout emerged on the other side of the swarm, emitting chunks of mulched up bee from the side exit exhaust.</p><p>The news was there. They wanted to know how I could deal with one of mankind’s most ancient enemies so gallantly, easily, trivially. I told them it was all due to modern electronic fuel injection and the majestic power of science. Someone, I still don’t know who, took my interview with the news and turned it into a YouTube techno remix focusing on chopping and screwing my autotuned voice as my bee-stained face flapped its gums in an almost-disembodied haze. It worked, I was famous. Beyond famous in that weird way that only 1960s pop stars and subway etiquette abusers in China are.</p><p>My odd quest continued. I had become “The Mulched Bee Guy,” touring the country and visiting high schoolers, teaching them about volumetric efficiency by chewing up entire hives full of bees with a desk-vise-mounted Eaton M90 and trying to liken it to their physics - or if they were religious schools, theory - classes.</p><p>At the end of one of my lectures, I think it was in Montana, but maybe South Dakota, the snow was falling outside the window. I caught a glimpse of a student’s reflection who had stayed behind to ask me more questions about science.</p><p>“Do you think,” they asked me, eyes wide with hope, “they will ever invent a transmission which can shift itself?”<br/></p><p>“Absolutely not, Timmy,” I barked back. “Such speech is heresy.”<br/></p>

<p>The man from Warner Brothers was livid.</p><p>“Can you believe this Confederate flag mumbo jumbo? My ancestors didn’t die for their right to earn slaves just for some hoity-toity academic to come out and tell me that I need to get rid of the flags from my movie props!”<br/></p><p>I told him I had the situation well in hand.</p><p>And that’s how I ended up grinding the Confederate flags off the roofs of all the remaining General Lees by launching them through a Georgian shopping mall.</p><p>It wasn’t easy, but furthering the national discourse never is.</p>

EVEN FROM MY RECLINING POSITION I CAN SEE THE HAIR BRISTLE ON THE BACK OF THE SNAP ON GUY&rsquo;S NECK. SOME DEEP BURIED INSTINCT OF HIS PROTOSIMIAN ANCESTORS KNOWS THAT SOMETHING UNNATURAL AND HORRIBLE IS COMING HIS WAY, EVEN BEFORE THE BLOWER RIPS ITS WAY THROUGH A THROTTLE PLATE AND BEGINS INGESTING AIR AND NITROUS LIKE A DENTIST ON PCP.<br/></p><p>

STANDING OVER THE SHATTERED WRECKAGE OF THE IVECO I SHOULDER MY BOUNTY AND STEP ASIDE. THE POLICE RESPONDED AWFULLY QUICKLY, I THINK, BEFORE NOTICING A BEEPING AND FLASHING PANIC BUTTON ON WHAT REMAINS OF THE FAUX-LEATHER DASH.<br/></p><p>

BEFORE LONG, THE RUST ON MY HOOD IS TURNING BLUE AS I HIT THE PART OF MY SPEEDOMETER THAT USUALLY INDICATES THE COLLAPSE OF MENTAL FUNCTION IN ORDINARY FUNCTIONING ADULTS. THE CORE OF MY BEING, RETREATED INTO THE BACK OF MY MIND DECADES AGO, IS UNAFFECTED AND REMAINS FULLY CAPABLE OF PUTTING A POLICE PURSUIT CAPRICE THROUGH A TELEPHONE COMPANY SUBSTATION.<br/></p><p>SAFE AT LAST, I STEP OUT OF THE BLOWN AND SLAMMED CITATION X-11 AND REMOVE MY PRIZE. THE SNAP-ON 3/8 INCH LITHIUM ION IMPACT DRIVER IS FINALLY MINE.</p>

<p>A COUPLE YEARS AGO A DOOR TO DOOR ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN CAME TO THE DOOR. SUSPECTING HIM TO ACTUALLY BE A MEMBER OF THE FBI, NSA, CSIS, CSI OR WORST OF ALL NHRA I CLOSED THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY HIT THE BUTTON THAT ENGAGED THE “GHOST PROTOCOL.” IT’S CLASSIFIED WHAT THAT BUTTON ACTUALLY DOES AND I SUSPECTED THEN AS I DO NOW THAT THE SELLER OF THE GARAGE COMPOUND WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND LIKED CARS TOO MUCH.</p><p>MY PRIMARY OBSERVATION: IN THIS CASE, THE BUTTON DID NOTHING IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.</p><p>THE DOOR TO DOOR ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN TRIPPED OVER THE CURB ON THE WAY OUT AND TURNED HIS ANKLE.

TWO AND A HALF TONS OF PREMIUM GRADE TOLEDO IRON WAS EXPOSED TO THE SUNLIGHT, AND I JUMPED INSIDE THE DOORLESS 1985 COMANCHE, ADOPTING A SUIT OF ARMOUR ANALOGOUS TO MY ANCIENT DRAGON-SLAYING ANCESTORS.</p>

<p>When I came to Hooker Hole, Louisiana, a few months ago, I didn’t expect the townspeople to accept me as one of their own. They had eccentricities, sure, they had novel hangout locations and little secret societies and a general store that was open by appointment only. But I grew to love it, and I had hoped that my new neighbors would warm up to me once they saw the love I had in my heart for the Hole.</p><p>I had inherited the local lawnmower machine shop when I first came to town. The former machinist owner of the shop was still missing, crude black and white photocopies of his drivers’ license picture blown up and tacked on the walls of the general store, the old mill, the bar.</p><p>I knew that the townspeople probably suspected me, but this is one of the few times I hadn’t destroyed a man’s life with a car in order to get what I wanted in the short term. Mostly because I had no car.</p><p>As I worked late into the evening one night on my magnum opus, I heard a jingling and footsteps outside the thin corrugated-steel walls. Pulling out my Harbor Freight “Earthquake” impact wrench for protection, I hit the button that engaged the three-hundred-thousand lumen LED lights surrounding my properly. A man screamed from outside, and I stepped out to see a quivering lump, the fetal position, in the grass.</p><p>He was the previous owner, he explained, and this was his shop. He had just gone off on a bender, gotten lost in the next town over after mouthing off to some rural toughs. He escaped from their suicide-cult bunker after they all drank the Uplifting Fluid, which he conspiratorially told me with a wink may have just been the entire reserves of their spare lamp oil. I knew now that this man was playing the future version of my life, and had probably come here under similar circumstances.</p><p>I invited him into my - his - house, and we sat and talked long into the night. Hours into our conversation, we determined that the best course of action was to leave the tri-state area and put as many miles between him and the pursuing detectives as possible. It turns out when you massacre a suicide cult, it’s still illegal in Obama’s America.</p><p>We went into the back room and pulled a dust cover off the MacGuffin. Underneath the cover was seven point five three liters of angry side oiler. As I engaged the underhood starter, I grinned as the twin turbochargers sucked their first gasp of confused air into their angry vortices. The Futura shook under the load.</p><p>I barely had a chance to look at my newfound partner before everything went dim. When I awoke, the Fairmont and the lawnmower repairman were gone. I grimaced, rubbed my head, and engaged the remote car starter for the backup plan.</p><p>In the yard outside, buried beneath ground cover, I could just dimly hear the sound of a supercharger belt squeal.</p>

<p>I VIOLENTLY DOWNSHIFTED THE BAJA BUG, MAKING THE CLUTCH THROWOUT ROD BOUNCE ANGRILY INSIDE THE OVERLOADED TRANSMISSION AS IT WAVERS ON WORN BEARINGS. I SWORE INWARDLY - EVERY OUNCE OF POWERTRAIN TORQUE I COULD MUSTER HAD TO BE DEDICATED TO FORWARD MOTION OR THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY SHORT TRIP.</p><p>LAUNCHING OFF THE HANDICAP ACCESS RAMP, I MOMENTARILY GOT AIR, THE HALF-INCH ALUMINUM SKIDPLATE SCRAPING THE TOP OF THE MALL FOUNTAIN BEFORE THE COMPELLING FORCE OF GRAVITY RETURNED MY AIR-COOLED DEATH WAGON TO THE LOVING EMBRACE OF MOTHER EARTH. I WORKED THE WHEEL LIKE STEAMBOAT WILLIE, CRANKING THE BUG UP ON TWO WHEELS AND PLOWING THROUGH THE PLATE-GLASS DISPLAY WINDOW OF AN ELECTRONICS BOUTIQUE.</p><p>SALESPEOPLE, STANDEES AND COSPLAYERS ALIKE SCATTERED FOR COVER, SCREAMING IN THEIR ALIEN TONGUE IN ANGER AT MY INSOLENCE. I REALIZED THAT I HAD MADE A GRIEVOUS ERROR IN JUDGMENT, AND PINNED THE THROTTLE IN REVERSE HARD ENOUGH TO DO AN AXLE-TRAMP BURNOUT (930 CV SHAFTS WERE A GREAT UPGRADE, I THOUGHT AT THE TIME) THAT LAUNCHED THE STORE MANAGER INTO THE AIR, PULLING THE CARPET OUT FROM UNDER HIM LIKE A DRUNKEN CHILDREN’S BIRTHDAY MAGICIAN.</p><p>I COULD HEAR THE TINKLING NOW AS FAUX BRICKWORK TUMBLED FROM THE DESTROYED STOREFRONT ONTO THE CRUDELY WELDED BULL BAR. NO MIND, I THOUGHT, THE PAINTWORK ON THIS THING IS PERFECT JUST THE WAY IT IS. I PULLED THE HANDBRAKE AND WHIPPED THE FUHRER’S CAVALIER INTO SHAPE AS ANOTHER RUN THROUGH THE GEARS BECKONED.</p><p>THE BUG CRUSHED THE IMMACULATE TILE UNDERFOOT AS I RAN DOWN THE SECURITY GATES TO A LOCAL HUDSON’S BAY, POWERSLID THROUGH WOMEN’S FASHION, AND FINALLY SMASHED THROUGH THE GRAND ENTRANCE, DRAGGING HALF OF HOUSEWARES BEHIND ME. IN THE PARKING LOT, I CURSED MY IDIOCY. HOW COULD I HAVE DONE SOMETHING SO RECKLESS?</p><p>FORZA 6 WASN’T EVEN CLOSE TO OUT YET.</p>

<p>I was on the morning news - of course I was - I was the new weatherman, you see. I had shown up for the weatherman auditions that morning and since nobody else showed up - there was a typo in the Facebook post maybe? I don’t know - I got the job. Again, I was the new weatherman for KXLT Channel 6, the number-eight news cast in the tri-city area.</p><p>My boss Ted called me in almost immediately. My job was to pick up the ratings. I needed to pull the station around. At first they had wanted a “regular” weather man. Someone normal, to reassure them about the weather, someone they could relate to, imagine at their kitchen table or even in their bed. But the station owner saw me, and immediately demanded a change of course. I was to be the leading edge of what he called “weird weather,” in between hits of what I imagined to be immensely high-quality cocaine.</p><p>Ted, of course, wasn’t happy at the perversion of his journalistic ethics in exchange for ratings, especially when it was going to be me up on camera. He had tried once, wasn’t weird enough, didn’t have a hook, couldn’t cut it in local television news as the talent. Had to support the talent. It ate him up inside, I would later realize, as I caught him throughout the day taking nips of fingers of whisky between meetings when he thought nobody was looking.</p><p>But that first day was something magical.</p><p>I got up on stage, stood in front of the blue screen - partially out of frame, of course, I didn’t know I had to stand on the “X,” and described in an unbroken monotone the current state of atmospheric conditions over the tri-city area. Then something broke inside me. The electricity of show business filled my veins. I pointed to the cameraman, told him to come in close because there was something going on. Something with the <i>economy</i>.</p><p>I hit all the key words that people had trained themselves to hear from a real newscast, but I strung them together in a string of high pitched, high speed squealing that they wouldn’t understand upon close reading. I ended the weather cast by speaking in tongues, telling the watchers to strap on their thunderstorm diapers and finally ordering the execution of a local politician to appease me.</p><p>When I got back to my office, the phone was ringing off the hook.

What had I unleashed?</p><p>Twenty years later, I was still wondering, sitting atop my throne of skulls. It turned out all that people ever wanted was a weatherman to lead them.</p>

I UNLOCKED THE SYRUP VAULT, SHIFTING AWKWARDLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE, ALLOWING THE SQUISH OF MY DR. SCHOLL&rsquo;S PROTECTIVE INSOLES TO CALM MY RAGGED NERVES.<br/></p><p>HERE, AT LAST, I HAD FOUND WHERE IT HAD BEGUN. HERE, ALSO, WAS WHERE IT WOULD END.</p><p>A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THE HIGHLY TRAINED COMMANDO UNIT THAT I WORKED FOR HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES. WE WERE TOLD TO WORK FOR THE JAPANESE ON AN EXOTIC NEW “CONVENIENCE STORE” CONCEPT. BEING ONLY TRAINED PREVIOUSLY ON INCONVENIENCE STORES, OUR EARLY DEMONSTRATIONS WERE INEFFECTIVE, AND OUR CAPTORS SAVAGELY BEAT US. STEVE “NIPPLES” HEMINGWAY WAS THE FIRST TO DIE, HIS RICKETS-STRICKEN FACE FROZEN IN A GRIMACE THAT I WILL REMEMBER TO THE LAST OF MY DAYS.</p><p>FINALLY WE DEVELOPED THE SLURPEE TECHNOLOGY AND OUR WEAPONIZED SLUSH PRODUCT BECAME THE CORE COMPONENT OF 7-11 CONVENIENCE STORES AS THEY BEGAN THEIR MARCH OF GLOBAL DOMINATION.</p><p>WHEN THE WAR ENDED AND I HAD ESCAPED, I PUT TOGETHER WHAT I COULD, AND SET OUT ON A GOAL FOR REVENGE.</p><p>THE 7-11 BATTALION WAREHOUSE HAD BEEN WELL GUARDED, BUT IT WAS NOTHING THAT A SERIES OF RUBBER BULLETS FIRED FROM THE MIRROR-MOUNTED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIMETER CHAIN GUNS ON MY 1967 VISTA CRUISER BATTLE WAGON COULDN’T FIX. THROUGH A SERIES OF CAR CHASES, NEAR MISSES AND DEATH-DEFYING STUNTS I HAD BARGED INTO THE CENTRAL RESEARCH OFFICE ATOP A BURNING STEED SHOD IN GENERAL GRABBER AT2S AND STEPPED OUT BEFORE THE VAULT.</p><p>INSIDE, I KNEW, WAS HUMANITY’S GREATEST TREASURE, THE SOURCE OF INFINITE POWER. THE LAST GENUINE BAG OF “NEW COKE” SYRUP FROM THE NINETEEN-SEVENTIES. IT IS SAID THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS SAFE RETURN, THE PRESIDENT OF COCA COLA WOULD GRANT ITS HOLDER THREE WISHES.</p><p>WHEN WE WERE IMPRISONED, I TOLD MY COMRADES, ONE DAY I WOULD ESCAPE AND GIVE THE NEW COKE WISHES AT MY DAUGHTER’S WEDDING, A FINAL LEGACY FROM AN ABSENT FATHER.</p><p>HOWEVER, HAVING SPENT ALL OF MY TIME AND MONEY BOLTING CRIMINALLY POWERFUL SUPERCHARGERS ONTO ALREADY OBSCENELY OVERPOWERED V8 ENGINES, I REMAINED CHILDLESS AT AGE FIFTY-TWO.</p><p>I FIRED THE REMOTE TRIGGER ON THE WINCH AND PULLED THE SYRUP VAULT WIDE OPEN. WHAT I SAW NEXT SHOCKED ME MORE THAN A BUZZFEED ARTICLE, AND THAT’S NOT EASY.</p><p>STANDING INSIDE THE EMPTY VAULT WAS ONLY STEVE “NIPPLES” HEMINGWAY, POINTING A REVOLVER AT MY FOREHEAD.</p>

<p>I got the contract to write the next 50 Shades of Grey book but they told me that I needed to go back to prison after I turned in the first draft which was a Tolkienesque tome containing extensive description of the fabric weave pattern in the captain&rsquo;s chair in the 1979 Winnebago Brave that landed with an audible and visceral thud on the editor&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>So obviously I needed to shop around and find another publisher for my work, just change a few of the names. Also cut out the complex subplot inside Home Depot that was dedicated to trying to find the correct size metric bolts before breaking down in tears and having to buy a tap set that would re-tap the rivnuts - against all common engineering advice <i>how dangerous and sexy</i> - to an inferior SAE fastener spec. Needless to say, it wasn’t my original work anymore.</p><p>Stunned and alone, I went onto the Kindle store. On the best-sellers list was <i>I Got Anally Penetrated By The Abstract Concept of Anal Penetration In A Zoo</i>. I immediately hammered the upload button.</p>

<H1>The Weird Hole</H1>
<p>I always wondered where that weird hole in my stucco came from. But I was getting closer to the truth with every passing day.</p><p>When I first bought this house, I had a home inspector come by prior to the final signing of the mortgage. Everything was in order, like you’d expect. The usual kind of problems with stucco, grout, wiring not to code, poor drainage. But then at the bottom of the inspection report he wrote “weird hole.”</p><p>I called his office, but the line was disconnected. Over the following weeks, his screaming and crying family would blanket the local and (for a brief time) national airwaves wondering where he had gone, demanding that his captors release him.</p><p>A few months into ownership I decided to get the house painted. I called the university-student painting service, not wanting to spend a lot of money, but not wanting to do it myself either. I picked an off-white eggshell colour, which would blend into the neighborhood better, maybe reduce my NIMBY threat rating from “high” to “guarded.” Either way, a squadron of university students showed up and started painting, but again, at the end of the day, one of them was missing. He was the one that was supposed to be handling the exterior stucco wall with the weird hole in it.</p><p>I had made a grevious mistake, I assume, and now there were witnesses. The police were called, set up a protective cordon around my house. Investigated. Interviewed my neighbors, who let their deepest and most ridiculous suspicions of me come to light. I felt imprisoned in my own home, an outsider.</p><p>Eventually they came to take me to jail. My court trial was short, considering the plethora of evidence the police forensics teams had found around my home and area. They couldn’t pin it on me directly, but somehow my lawyer failed to protect me. I think he suspected what they did. If I didn’t do something, I was going to go down for this.</p><p>In jail, I met with my lawyer one last time. I pleaded with him to investigate the weird hole, handed him the newspaper clippings from coverage of the disappearances.</p><p>At the end of our conversation, barely choking back a wry smile, I invited him to look at the weird hole himself.</p>

<p>Once I had a boss who laughed at Dilbert comics that he had printed out and taped to his office door. Eventually I got fed up, and told him, no, you’re suppposed to be this guy, and tapped gently on the pointy haired boss mid-harangue.</p><p>He started screaming. He didn’t stop, even after I got up and left his office and closed the door behind me.</p><p>I came back the next day and he was still in there, face contorted in terror, the same clothes, a little more unshaven. Still screaming.</p><p>At the time, I was driving this little ‘79 MGB GT, one of the last ones they ever made. British-Leyland build quality didn’t do the Lucas electrics any favours, and of course I was late to work quite often.</p><p>I began to fantasize about leaving a moped in the underbrush about halfway through my 15-kilometer commute, so that at least I would have mechanized transport to carry me further in the event of any future Fish &amp; Chips Car Illness. I knew, however, that the moped would rot in the bushes while the MGB glowered and ticked endlessly onward, out of jealousy and blind anger, at the concept that I would think myself one step ahead of the unearthly power of bad British cars.</p><p>Detente impossible, we continued our daily competition, the MGB racking up the points whenever it lost idle with the left turn signal on, me evening the score when I left it outside to get hailed on during that heady summer. In a very real way, when I reflect upon it now, I realize it was similar to what I was doing in my work life. My boss, too, would treat our power dynamic as a competition, trying to place work he didn’t want to do on my nose and watch me clean it off.</p><p>The previous night, I had finally cured one of the MGB’s most persistent irritants. There was an ancient wiring harness hanging down through the firewall, and the grommet had rotted in such a way that it became permanently part of the wire’s insulation. Not wanting to touch the problem, but somehow demanding to myself that I must, I did a quick crimps-and-beer repair job and fired the car back up. It worked. I was elated. Hooked, even. I quickly resolved to solve all of the other problems in my life, to enjoy that sense of success again.</p><p>That morning, I pulled into my assigned parking spot, one wheel squealing thanks to the open diff as I took an aggressive airplane loop around an errant bicyclist to line my approach up perfectly, and walked directly into my boss’ office, an unbroken stride of sheer confidence. After I dropped the Dilbert bomb on him, I walked back out.</p><p>I was going to leave this job, walk out and never look back. Just me and the MGB GT from now on. I was going to be free, not require any other man. I was going to be my own man, be successful, live off the land.</p><p>My phone dinged.</p><p>It was a Moss Motors sale on Eaton blowers.</p><p>I sat back down and continued working quietly.</p>

<p>Most of my fun when playing golf comes from driving the cart, I reflect, barrelling through the pro shop with my nitromethane-fired Briggs. Caddies and pros alike scatter, finally equalized under the threat of an external aggressor, as the chromoly tube frame bumper bites into the throw carpet under hard braking as I bus-steer the ship around, pointing it directly at the foremost plate glass window, and pin the throttle.</p><p>Angry barks emanate from behind me, both from the de jure citizenry of this fine country club and the now-overwhelmed Briggs, its ridiculously overbored diaphragm carburetor vibrating so quickly at the demand for aspirated fuel that the entire gas tank is fighting its mounts. The Cub Cadet (Model 70, of course, who do you think I am, a poor?) frame harmonizes with it as the fiberglass replica panels shake at the extent of their dzus connectors. Holding back 175 wheel horsepower on any lawn tractor is no mean feat, but the Cadet does it admirably.<br/></p><p>Stepping out of the cart, shod in reflective safety orange tartan, I arrive at the green perfectly coiffed beneath a jaunty golf cap. Naturally, I apologize to the players who are already there. My ball went a little wide, I explain, and I just had to come over here and play it as it lays. I hear throats clear, and some rumbling about what is to be <i>done</i> about this infuriating gearhead rabble.</p><p>“Fore!” I scream, as I nail a line drive directly through the heretofore-unbroken pro shop’s windows, perfectly restoring my game to the fairway of the hole I was playing.<br/></p><p>When I returned to my own game, they were waiting for me, standing atop the origin of a 250-foot-long divot which was produced by the Cadet’s launch control module’s heinous but mathematically sublime burnout. How was I going to set FTD with them standing in the way now?</p>

<p>I turn the traction control up from “firing squad” to “menthol cigarettes” as I lean out the drivers’ side window and prepare to aim my mirror-mounted grappling hook.</p><p>My team of rascals had been summoned to the south of France, to find and stop a rogue general who had gone AWOL with top-secret military information. After a period of montages, we assembled a team and powerful automobiles, both of them forged in combat and twisted by pure will into something more than their parts.</p><p>Hard on the rear bumper, I drew the fleeing Panamera up in the braking zone and then forced the driver to take a wide angle to avoid running off the road. The glint from the grappling hook’s sight bead caught me in the eye, momentarily distracted me, and I fired before having the best grip. The hook smashed through the drivers’ side $7500-retail-priced LED tail light, but failed to gain purchase in the voluminous yet underappreciated hatch area.</p><p>My dangerously vibrating passenger side wing mirror began to flash a blind spot warning as my partner pulled alongside in the corner, his built FD RX7 wailing to the redline with a sound not unlike tearing paper in a blast furnace. He, too, fired his grappling hook, this time puncturing the $11,550 rear bumper skin and causing immense damage to the $25,610 array of parking alert sensors and their attached $1,350 biodegradable wiring harness.</p><p>I wound the grappling hook back in as the corner straightened out, swinging the FD into the front right fender of my ‘68 Ranch Wagon, sending a featherlike black mist of carbon fiber shards into the air. The Panamera hit the gas, its huge turbos spooling and then launching into the distance like an SR-71 with rabies.</p><p>It had no real chance. I chuckled as I cranked the boost controller up, the Ranch Wagon screaming and biting at the road as the sheer torsional force attempted to rotate the chassis around its mid-mounted twin-supercharged LS7. The Panamera’s entire rear end disappeared beneath the bullbars and I felt the impact shudder through my spine as countless hundreds of thousands of dollars of maintenance visits flashed through my victim’s face.</p><p>I drew the grappling hook again and fired, latching through the shattered carcass of the Porsche directly into the rear seat’s structural support. Both of us slammed on the brakes while dropping the cars into reverse, dragging the Panamera down to its death with the tension strength of the behemoth grappling hook cables. Before long, the Panamera’s engine surrendered, sending out a shuddering death gasp that ruptured the transfer case and threw chains across the highway.</p><p>I pulled myself out of my car and walked coolly to the general’s stricken ubermobile.</p><p>That’s how we ended up on the run, because it turns out that stolen government secrets buy a lot of car parts. At <i>dealership</i> prices, even.</p>

<p>The wrecker sales agent gives me some static. I can dimly hear a dog begin to bark, out of fear, on the other end of the line.<br/></p><p>They say dogs can sense a natural disaster before it happens, which is half true. there&rsquo;s nothing natural about the Trans Am Turbo as I one-arm it around the gravel lot of their sales trailer, shooting gravel and tire belts like machine-gun fire through the plate glass windows with superhuman accuracy.</p><p>Before long, I’ve found my quarry for myself and lowered it into the almost-voluminous hatch of the Turbo. Placing my hand upon it, I can swear I feel a life inside it. I look in the rear view mirror: illuminated by the flashing LED strobes of the entire city police department is the workaday block casting of a Viper V10.</p>

<p>A very long time ago I stood over a dead mod motor&rsquo;s body and pulled the trigger until it clicked. It was finally over. I had fulfilled my life&rsquo;s B-plot by successfully pre-emptively breaking all eight spark plugs. There would be no surprises held in this one that a 300 ft-lb Harbor Fright earthquake rattle gun burst couldn&rsquo;t tease out. I removed what was left of the plugs, in comfort, my mind settled.</p><p>I was starting to recline on the Harley-Davidson branded hydraulic reclining creeper, purchased a month previous from an estate sale, still in its plastic wrap, when my assistant burst into the room. Jaw agape and eyes flapping, he implored me to take a look in the parking lot and see what had happened.</p><p>You could have taken this scene and transplanted it into any shop forecourt, any garage condo’s mistakes bin, or any tire shop’s alignment rack. But it was happening to me.</p><p>The sight of it made me sick to my stomach. A Chrysler PT Cruiser was awaiting service, and the owner stood over it proudly, like a protective hawk.</p>

THEY TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO BE THE YOUNGEST AND MOST PROFESSIONAL POPE EVER, BUT TO KEEP IT UNDER MY (NOW AUSPICIOUSLY LARGE) HAT UNTIL THEY COULD MAKE THE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT.</p><p>MY FIRST STOP? THE VATICAN GARAGE, OF COURSE. I GOT THEM TO START WORK IMMEDIATELY ON MY NEW COMPANY CAR. ITALIAN WASN’T MY FORTE (SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET CHANGED DURING MY PAPAL REIGN) BUT MY HAND GESTURES AND MOUTH NOISES MANAGED TO GET IT ACROSS TO THE ASSEMBLED MECHANICS WELL ENOUGH.</p><p>A FEW MONTHS PASSED, AND SUDDENLY THE PAPERS WERE ABUZZ. THE NEW POPEMOBILE WAS FINISHED, AND A SPY PHOTOGRAPHER HAD CAUGHT IT ON THE NURBURGRING. I LEAPT FROM MY BED, STORMING TO THE VATICAN GARAGE, THROBBING WITH ANTICIPATION FROM MY ENORMOUS HAT DOWN TO TO MY POPE-SIZE TRAINERS.</p><p>IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. AND IT WAS MINE.</p><p>WHERE ONCE AN ALFA ROMEO MONTREAL HAD SAT, NOW SAT A POPEMOBILE. TWISTED TO WRETCHED EXCESS, THE PEARLESCENT WHITE PAINTJOB WAS ALREADY BROWNING FROM THE TRANSCENDENT HEAT PUMPED OUT BY THE TWO HOOD-MOUNTED SIXTY SEVEN MILLIMETER BALL BEARING TURBOCHARGERS THAT DOMINATED WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE FORWARD VISIBILITY.</p><p>IN AN HOMAGE TO THE FAITHFUL PROSTRATING THEMSELVES BEFORE THEIR LORD, I MADE THE TURBOCHARGERS AT A SLIGHT CANT, BOWING TO THE IMMENSE NINE LITER BLOWER STICKING BETWEEN THEM, TOUCHING THE SKY IN A HOLY INCARNATION.</p><p>IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE CAR TO FIT ENTIRELY IN THE SQUALID GARAGE, I NOTED WITH SOME DISDAIN. THE TWIN-DAMPER TROPHY TRUCK SUSPENSION LIFTING THE ITALIAN ROCKET CLOSER TO OUR LORD, ABOVE ITS HUMBLE THIRTY-FIVE-INCH KEVLAR WRANGLERS CUT SOME OF THE ROOF CLEARANCE.</p><p>I COULD HEAR THE HARPS SING AS THE SUN SHOT GORGEOUS BEAMS THROUGHOUT THE RICKETY BACK ALLEY GARAGE.

I SLAM THE HOOD ON THE DODGE PHOENIX, FEELING THE RICKETY PARTS-STORE SHOCKS ROCK THE CRUDELY WELDED BULLBAR BUMPER TO SLEEP.</p><p>THE ONLY PLACE TO GO FOR BURRITOS IN TOWN IS CLEARLY SENOR CAPITALISMO’S, BUT I KNOW THAT MY RIVAL, STEVE “NIPPLES” HEMINGWAY, IS GOING TO BE THERE. HE WILL CHALLENGE ME TO A DRAG RACE. I CONSIDER A DIFFERENT VEHICLE THAN THE PHOENIX, BUT TO CHANGE CARS AT THIS JUNCTURE MAY REQUIRE SHUFFLING OF STREET PARKED VEHICLES IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE NITROMETHANE-GUZZLING ILTIS OR THE TRIPLE-SUPERCHARGED DETROIT DIESEL CORVETTE.

I CHOOSE TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR IDENTITY POLITICS.</p><p>THE RACE BEGINS.</p><p>I HAVEN’T BEEN FULLY HONEST WITH YOU UP TO THIS POINT IN THE STORY. YOU SEE, I HAD BEEN JACKING UP THE AIR CLEANER IN ORDER TO DROP A NEW ENGINE UNDERNEATH IT. THE BORED, STROKED, MASSAGED AND TWIN TURBOCHARGED SMALL BLOCK CHEVY BENEATH THE HOOD SCREAMS WITH A PROFANE RAGE THROUGH ITS SMOOTHED AND EXTENDED CATHEDRAL PORTS.</p><p>SENOR CAPITALISMO HIMSELF PRESENTS ME WITH A KEY TO BURRITO CITY WHEN I RETURN.

That’s a magical thing in the ether that grown-ups blame for all their troubles because blaming God gets them smote and blaming the government or rich people gets them shot.</p><p>Regardless, I found myself one fine April morning picking up a new student in my assigned student driving car, a Toyota Aygo. Since it’s me, I had surreptitiously done a bit of “field repair” to the vehicle, fitting it with a dual channel nitrous fogger and a leftover Toyota OEM supercharger scrounged from a dealership dumpster. My student was the one that was really in need of repair.</p><p>After a few hours of disastrous parallel parking attempts, she broke into tears, opening up to me about the physical abuse she was victim to at home, how she needed to drive to get away, but it wasn’t working. What else was I supposed to do? The driving instructor manual (”PAGE 15: ALERTING THE POLICE TO STUDENTS WHO SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU”) was worthless. I asked her to get out of the car, and then we took the little Toyota to a garage condo on the edge of the city.</p><p>The student hid behind me while I hit the switch to lower the warehouse door. I found through my travels that some children are especially attuned to the dip in the astral plane that this car represents, and can sense it from a distance. Born survivors, I thought, as I thumbed the remote starter in my pocket and the Trans Am Turbo leapt to life, pulling at the straps holding it to the chassis dyno. It seethed with fury, the X-pipe exhaust glowing all the way back to the first muffler.</p><p>I threw the keys to the student and told her it was time for her final test.</p><p>Years later, I saw her again, working out of a home garage in a seedy part of town. Her face, arms and neck were covered in engine oil and transmission fluid, and she was jumping up and down on a breaker bar to split a steering knuckle off a shoebox Chevy. I decided to ask her how it went, but she saw me first and stormed towards my direction, fists balled and outstretched.</p><p>“Why did you fail me on the instructor assessment?” she spat.<br/></p><p>“Your parallel parking was awful,” I replied, “look at what it did to that <i>house</i>.”<br/></p>

<p>I awaken from my uneasy road-trip slumber in the back of the Fit. I take two more hits of shabu from the ashtray compartment and pop the clutch. Detroit beckons, and I obey.</p><p>Years ago, when the state of Michigan fell to right-wing austerity politics and the flames of economic warfare, we looked on and watched it die. But there was something in Detroit that would live forever, and I set off to find it that day.</p><p>Driving past blasted-out buildings, old art museums repurposed as parking garages, signs of well-worn streets where the frost jacking had finally claimed a victory over the skeletal maintenance teams’ nearly-fruitless attempts to maintain equilibrium. Detroit was a worn city, but it was impossible to miss just how badly worn it had gotten. Place looked like a Neon clutch surface after a year of pizza delivery use by a twelve year old.</p><p>There was a relentless spirit here, though, something that was inventive, different, and reflected in the LS7 that I had crudely ratchet-strapped to my roof rails a few hundred miles ago on my pilgrimage.</p><p>Before long, I had come across my quarry. It was an impossible, beautiful jewel, seeming to raise itself above its background in a halo of pure refracted light.</p><p>A 1982 Eagle SX4 SCCA Rallycross car. It brought tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>I let go of the ground cable and the alligator clip settled into its new position with a sizzle and pop. We were in business.</p><p>For years, in order to maximize street, driveway, alley, backyard and garage parking, I had been breaking up my car collection and distributing them across the neighborhood. It had gotten so bad that I had to purchase a new car, a Festiva, just to serve as a shuttle vehicle when I needed to visit some of the far-flung cars, which were often as much as a kilometer away and sort of impractical to walk to in order to drive them to work.</p><p>Recently, though, one of the neighbors had gotten irritated. He had stolen the license plate off an admittedly-non-functional Plymouth Sapporo and demanded its execution to our parking authority, which towed it away and put it up at the abandoned-cars auction. Not realizing it was already my car, I repurchased it alongside a new-to-me Dodge Ramcharger before finally getting around to noticing that it was mine and working backwards to the guilty party.</p><p>What else was I supposed to do?</p><p>Security screws were expensive, but breaking open a light standard and using its 220V power source to tack weld the license plate onto the bumper was cheap.</p><p>I stubbed out my cigarette, lowered my welding mask and tapped the wire-feed trigger twice in my customary good-luck twitch. The Millermatic growled with anticipation. My earpro was so good that I almost didn’t hear the neighbor on his porch, cocking his shotgun. Almost.</p>

<p>I leaned back in my seat, preparing to feel the G-forces as I reached for an invisible shifter. Riding the bus was getting rough.</p><p>Ever since the local police department had taken mild umbrage with my concept of cutting my commute time in half by driving over their perfectly manicured lawn, I’d been stuck without a license. And that meant no more fun times with the paddlewheel-tired Mercury Montclair dune buggy that I had fabricated for the unique demands of my high-peformance commute.</p><p>The driver lurched on acceleration - the coward has weak throttle control, I swore inwardly, <i>use your whole ankle</i> - and then gave up a primo late apex in favour of bogging the engine. This was going to be the longest bus ride of my life.</p><p>I looked out the passenger side window, daydreaming about what it would be like to own each of the cars I would see outside. To be normal. To be unafflicted by this ailment that seemed irretrievable from the muck of my soul. That’s when I saw him.</p><p>My coworker, Steve “Nipples” Hemingway, in his tan Camry. I had ridden in it to get burritos, once, the massive dashboard, floaty handling and chunky automatic shifter leaving much more of an impact on me than the high-quality sound deadening, affordable feature set and healthy resale value that had sold Steve a credit note on it. </p><p>Without warning, the driver pulled jerkily across three lanes of traffic, causing every day commuters to brake with terrible reflexes. I cursed their lack of forward planning, and resolved to open a driving school when the judicial system had completed its circuit of my guilt. </p><p>At the next stop, a judge I recognized from traffic court was waiting. I began to flop sweat as I reached into my messenger bag for the print-outs of my persuasive PowerPoint deck. I’d be back in a car any second now.</p>

<p>I tell my co-pilot to take over the driving duties as I open the Hornet’s door and crawl out onto the running boards. We had set out from Dallas only a few hours ago, and to stop for a service job already would set us back to an unacceptable degree.</p><p>Once this car was a Hudson Hornet. Now it would be more realistic to say that it was an amalgamation of dry-laid carbon fiber in the approximate shape of a Hornet. I figured nobody would come after me for copyright infringement, but kept an eye on the skies for lawdrones regardless.</p><p>Holding onto the side of a carbon-fiber fastback car from the 50s while going at integer multiples of the highway speed limit is no mean feat, but I managed to pull it off. Before long, I had climbed my way onto the rear quarter of the car and begun the mindless work of replacing the ancient fuel filters that fed its twincharged 455 Buick. First came switching to the backup fuel pump, and second came spilling several liters of perfectly good E85 onto the road and myself while swearing.</p><p>While I was returning to the drivers’ seat, I noticed a highway patrolman on the opposite side of the road. Surely a man dressed in a fire suit and helmet climbing across an ancient fastback reincarnated as an SR71 Blackbird is a typical thing for Texas highway traffic?</p><p>Back in the saddle, I turned the remote adjustment dial on the manual boost controller from “ludicrous” to “religious vision.” As if responding out of some mechanical sympathy to its distant V8 relation, the radar detector lit up on nearly every band.</p>

<p>Children scattered as the blower cleared its throat, compressing gallons of farm-fresh prairie air. Truth be told, I’d never really gotten used to how this thing could part crowds, like Moses hitting some South American logging road in a Group B suicide booth. I idled the Dauphine out onto the road, leaving the farmer’s market behind.</p><p>In the rear view mirror, I could dimly see the mesh bag of strawberries dangling off the tack-welded cargo hooks on the car’s rollbar. The tire noise of the 31-inch kevlar Wranglers underpinning the tiny Frenchmobile became a constant din and I flipped the safety cover off the subwoofer toggle to compensate. The mountain roads beckoned, and I was excited to meet once again on my way home with people who shared a common passion.<br/></p><p>Before long I had identified a new class of driving enthusiast who was interested in my automobile.</p><p>The officer raps on my plexiglass window, and it takes me a moment of fettering to remove it from the door-frame and store it behind my seat. He starts his routine spiel, then begins to look inside the car, at my mask and the sawzalled parcel shelf concealing a jagged air intake for the moaning Weiand blower sticking at a jaunty angle from the rear hood.</p><p>“Is there a problem, officer?” I ask innocently, trying to dodge any hint of malice that may emerge from my muffled voice.</p><p>

I let his eyes complete their circuit of my stripped-bare interior, lingering, I knew, on the ominous red button that sat atop the centre console. It was marked only with a Dymo label reading “DANGER CLOSE.” Tension hung in the air, like a gallery opening showing only Norman Rockwell paintings of the Tet Offensive.<br/></p><p>Some people call me a radical, a psychotic, someone who shouldn’t be allowed to operate the dangerous junkheaps that I drive. But in that exact moment something electric in the air passed between the officer and I. I guess you could call it mutual respect. He called it an equipment violation.</p>

<p>I click the button signalling my availability on the Uber app and immediately am bombarded with a nearby customer wishing to hail my vehicle. I shove it into gear and pull up in front of them, the engine idling gently as I try my best to put on a warm, welcoming smile like the training videos asked.</p><p>My vehicle is a Bombardier-built M35A2 military troop transport with an eight-point-two liter Detroit Diesel, which I think is ideal for inner-city taxi service. The putative customer doesn’t seem to agree, and starts to scramble on all fours, like a dog, away from my imposing war steed. I yell at him over the sound of the screaming Detroit, telling him it’s okay, I’m here to give him a ride, I just left the pink stick-on bumper mustache at home today. This news strikes him like a bolt of lightning and he sits, inert, looking over the transport with what I can gradually identify as a boyish glee at BIG TRUCK.</p><p>He yells something unintelligible, perhaps doing fact checking and begins climbing the 40 inch tall beadlocks with great effort, probably getting his Brooks Brothers suit filthy in the process. Paying no mind, he clambers inside the cabin and then immediately reaches for the roof-mounted pull cord, triggering the horn. Why does everyone <i>do</i> that?</p><p>Before long, our trip is done. He departs, laughing maniacally and making the internationally recognized sign of the V8 with his fingers as he heads into the courthouse. I have made negative two hundred dollars on this transaction, but it was all worth it, I think. My phone beeps.</p><p>Two stars, what the <i>fuck</i>?</p>

I LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AND SEE THEM NOW, CAMPED OUT IN THEIR RX350S AND DODGE TOWN AND/OR COUNTRIES, STARING AT WHAT WE HAVE MADE OF THE HOLY SITE OF THEIR WEEKLY OBLIGATION.</p><p>GLORY BE TO THE TWO POINT SEVEN LITER AIR COOLED PORSCHE ENGINE AS A VINTAGE 911 CRACKS OFF A FLAWLESS UP-TEMPO STACCATO UPSHIFT AND NARROWLY DODGES WIPING OUT SOME HERETICAL MARSHALS ON THEIR SMARTPHONES NEXT TO AN INCONVENIENTLY PLACED LIGHT STANDARD. THEY SAY FAITH TAKES BRAVERY AND IF THAT’S EVEN REMOTELY THE CASE I FEEL IN MY HEART THAT THE PORSCHE OWNER IS NEXT IN LINE FOR THE PAPACY.</p><p>IT IS TIME FOR MY RUN.

<p>The host at Chili’s screams a well-intentioned “IRASSHAIMASE!” at me, presumably seeing my anime-draped supercar pull up into the forecourt and assuming things about me that aren’t strictly true.</p><p>But maybe I should start from the beginning.</p><p>When I was in school, I was pretty much exclusively “the weird kid.” But eventually, I learned to harness my weirdness, at which point I was still “the weird kid” and then eventually “the weird kid who fell into a diabetic coma during Lianne Smith’s third grade recital, collapsing the extensible bleachers and causing the deaths of four more normal and arguably more worthwhile children.” It was a hard childhood, I’ll tell you that much.</p><p>Maybe I should speed my story along a little bit.</p><p>At my first job out of college I ended up working for this guy who had won trillions on the stock market selling technology stocks short in the dot com crash. He was the kind of guy who didn’t wear shoes, wouldn’t bathe, and he used emacs. In other words, absolutely repulsive. I felt a lot better about myself after working for him for awhile. But my job was to run gofer errands for him, and as such I ended up driving his <i>Love Hina</i>-inspired Lamborghini Huracan between various daily chores, as he refused to leave his opulent Beverly Hills mansion. He would get drunk sometimes and brag - always the same one - about how he had defeated Vanilla Ice at auction to secure this mansion, how it had a phenomenal view of the bay when he didn’t have the blinds closed and trying to configure emacs to read his newfangled HTML-encoded email through its web browser plugin.</p><p>And that’s how we came to the current day. The Huracan purrs under my feet, 700 horsepower wrapped in something I cannot be seen in public driving.</p><p>A yellow Fox body Mustang pulls up to me. It’s Ricky Schroeder, my high school nemesis. He looks over, begins to laugh. Maybe this car isn’t so bad after all, I think, seven blocks later travelling at the approximate speed of a Rafale jet fighter.</p>

<p>I threw another 2006 Tribeca factory service manual on the fire and relaxed into my lawn chair.</p><p>It had been years since I’d retreated off the grid to start my own company. Of course, things hadn’t quite worked out that way, with me always being out in the garage instead of turning code or rototilling crops or whatever it is that people expect to pay me for. Writing the occasional car-magazine cover story paid me enough for a comfortable lifestyle and I began to grow fat and lazy as I felt the stress of rush hour commuting dissipate. Like a wholly fictional LSD consumer, though, I would sometimes have flashbacks as my body attempted to metabolize the freak outs and hang ups buried deep within my muscle tissue.</p><p>But tonight I had to go back. I shifted on old bones, feeling my wrist tendons tense as I mashed the button on the two-stage remote starter, confirming the action. Something terrible in the garage awoke, being kicked sharply in the teeth by my call to action.</p><p>A late 90s Toyota Camry, in honorable-immigrant, blink-and-you-miss-it Cashmere Beige Metallic, was sitting in the “daily driver” bay of my garage. I climbed inside, sliding the plexiglass door window shut as I put the car into gear and started the arduous process of backing it off of my property. It was easier to back it out than go forward, you see, because of the twin-stacked Weiand roots blowers, shoving twirling seven-rib Kevlar belts into my field of vision, drawing my attention like a moth to the flame&hellip; even now when I close my eyes I can see those pulleys turning, the soft wail of compressors beneath a late summer night’s sky.</p><p>Before long, I was inside the city. But I was unprepared for what I would see next.</p><p>A Blockbuster Video. I laughed to keep from crying.</p>

<p>When I was a little boy, at the end of the hallway outside my bedroom was a light switch that didn’t appear to do anything.</p><p>Sometimes, when I was feeling particularly brave, I would flick it upward, but then lose my nerve after a few seconds - who knows what that switch was doing that I couldn’t see? - and flip it right back to off. I never did find out what that switch did, and I never would. By the time I came back to my parents’ house as an adult they had renovated around it, destroyed it and the wall it lived in in favour of a walk-through bathroom.</p><p>I thought about that switch a lot whenever I drove the Trans Am, because like the switch, I knew that it had some unholy power that could not be divined by careful study of the mechanicals. I had gotten too far in.</p><p>We were in Italy, participating in the Mille Miglia. Beautiful pre-war cars swarmed around the Trans Am. I reflexively withdrew from their anticipated scorn, but I eventually found none would be coming. In this country it lacked the welfare-class stereotypes of my homeland, and it was simply a cool car with an engine bigger than most apartments. The Trans Am, for its faults, was quite reasonable and easy to drive, despite the tight roads and crowded traffic that would ordinarily cause it to spin up its turbos and start an impression of a freight train on a cocaine bender. Perhaps this was its form of a vacation.</p><p>Our holiday snaps and beach tourism came to a short end, however, when I peered into the rear view mirror and by chance came across an unmarked Punto following us. He had been trying to keep his distance, but there was no hiding the intricately polished surface of the CNC-machined compressor housing sticking out of the beautifully laser-cut hood.</p><p>I caught his eyes in the rear view mirror at the next light, revved my engine a bit, stirring the beast that lived somewhere deep inside the false front of mechanicals in the shape of a Pontiac. I slipped the clutch a bit, letting the heinous carcasses out back slobber and distort on the damp morning cobblestone.</p><p>This was going to be something else.</p>

<p>I booted the Punto into gear with a quick flick of my wrist. The Voight-Kampff machine that is Rome spread out before me as I lit the tires up, the overboosted ball-bearing turbo sticking out of the hood doing its best imitation of a Rolls Royce jet engine as it cast a spell upon the engine and forced it to respond with unearthly crank-bending torque.</p><p>When they approached me to join the Carabinieri, I of course said no. I was just a writer, just a hobbyist mechanic. But they persisted. They told me there were a new class of criminals, who drove fast cars and raided banks. They wanted me to stop them. After enough chance encounters with the head of the automobile special services department, I reluctantly agreed.</p><p>I was a week into my new job when I had them build the Punto Pursuit Special. Sucking down environmentally friendly nitromethane at approximately the same rate as a forest fire, I would rip through the streets and bust Vespa-riding petty criminals with my combination of brutal street justice and driving on the sidewalks. Promotions ensued, and I moved into a beautiful cliffside villa where I learned the ancient twin skills of wine-making and nitrous tuning.</p><p>One day on patrol, everything changed. I heard an electric crackle rip through the still morning air. With the Mille Miglia in town, I was never particularly surprised at seeing high-dollar, high-horsepower machinery in my town. But today was different.</p><p>Before I could finish crossing the rugged cobblestone path in front of the coffee granita stand to get back in the Punto, I saw an impure beast that I recognized from my persistent nightmares.</p><p>Although I could not put a name to the make and model, my misspent youth had exposed me to much American TV from pirate satellite. Burt Reynolds. The Bandit.</p><p>The brown beast paused gently, flared its nostrils at me to taunt with a twin-turbo wail and a cough of overrich E85 exhaust, and tore off into the distance. I mashed the Punto’s engine start button and said an involuntary prayer to my ancestors, who I hoped were beastslayers.</p>

<p>I was a famous author once, you know.</p><p>I wrote under a pen name, hopefully you wouldn’t recognize it.</p><p>I hit rock bottom when I got invited onto Good Morning America and found myself drooling into Katie Couric’s old throat microphone, still slick with the scent of fear from the previous guest. The jackals wheeled out a succession of Dodge Vipers in the hope that my impending turgidity would move the needle on the ex-RCMP fruit machine they had won in a late night eBay bidding war.</p><p>But they were wrong. It wasn’t <i>good</i> cars that I liked. I had to think about a bored and stroked AMC Gremlin just to feel something akin to authentic delight at the presence of yet another six-figure supercar. They wanted a freak, but I was the wrong kind of freak.</p><p>Eventually they found out that I was truly and deeply weird, that my publicist had sold me as some kind of autistic car-advice manchild who could lend a soundbite to a morning show about the importance of keeping your windshield washer fluid topped up and contributing lots of money to dealerships who would install self-driving safety mechanisms to protect your children from your incompetence. They banished me. I was thrown into the mean streets of Burbank, forced to follow the writers of the distant past that I idolized.</p>

<p>I MADE A MISTAKE DECADES AGO THAT I CONTINUE TO REPENT FOR, I REALIZE. AS THE BAODIAN RECEIVES ITS HELLCAT TRANSPLANT LIGHTNING STRIKES OUTSIDE THE GARAGE, AN ILL OMEN THAT I DISREGARD UTTERLY.</p><p>I HAVE CREATED AN UTTER MONSTER IN MY PURSUIT OF THE HORSEPOWER DEMON, AND WORKED MYSELF INTO A CORNER IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE.

I WONDER DESPITE THE MEDICATION IF THERE IS SOME DIRT SPINNING UNDERFOOT IN A GULAG SOMEWHERE.</p><p>MY ACCOUNTANT CALLS AND ASKS WHAT I AM DOING WITH THE WINNINGS FROM BARRETT-JACKSON.

<p>My 327 falls out of the misfire tree and hits every branch on the way down.</p><p>We’re outside Hooker Hole, Louisiana, home of the Hooker Hole Diggers, the local foot-related sports team. My primered-out mystery Chevette has decided to pack it in, opting for a life of retirement on some ancient Barrett-Jackson fetishist’s back lawn rather than the sheer adventure and heinous physical abuse (”The Harshness”) that only I can dole out. I don’t hold it against the piece of shit, I say to it as I break a JDM road flare off in the fuel filler hole and walk away.</p><p>I assess the situation. My options for transportation are relatively limited. I think back to my operational training: first, secure shelter. Then, secure a bad ass hot rod. I hit the bricks. Within a month I have taken over the local lawnmower repair shop from the retired machinist that owned it. It was really a strange disappearance, the townsfolk tell me. Now that they’re my neighbors, they’ve warmed up to the peculiar outsider in their midst, clucking joyfully at my inability to take the combined heat of the atmospheric conditions and the air compressor’s exhaust while I air ratchet together something deeply awful.</p><p>My dad - a bohemian art student - used to always tell me that a man’s greatest work is to understand himself. If that’s the case, I must be a lifted ‘93 Miata on knobby tires with an Eaton blower sticking out of the jaggedly sawzall’d hood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early Ford Festiva with a 1.8L BP swap out of a Miata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the local hot rod hangout - Chuck&rsquo;s. Years ago this was a genuine soda shop, run by a single old man who loved what he did. Nowadays it&rsquo;s some investment bank&rsquo;s plaything, an asset on a ledger. The store is 50s - authentic down to the nines until you start to look a little closer and see &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; stamped on the nano-weathered red leather benches and triple-pane safety glass installed all around.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not relevant. The reason why I&rsquo;m telling you about this is because it&rsquo;s Saturday, and as such I get a chance to bring my just-completed car to the Cars and Coffee meet. I park it around the side, letting the rabble get their chance to appreciate the high-dollar Porsches and Lamborghinis. I imagine them getting to my car, looking at how little it cost me to go scary fast, and then demanding a ride of their own or immediately checking Craigslist on the spot.</p>
<p>Well, as you can expect, after a few hours, pretty much nobody had bothered to look at my little Festiva. It&rsquo;s not the car&rsquo;s fault, it&rsquo;s just that our society has failed to appreciate penny-pinching and intellectualism as virtues. I blame the outgrowth of aspirational politics, the protection of the rich as an elite class deserving of respect, keeping an eye on your peers while your boss picks your pocket. Purchasing huge condos and complicated mortgage schemes to try and fake it until you make it.</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh yeah, this Festiva has a 1.8L four cylinder from a late-model Miata swapped into it in lieu of its stock 1.3L four-cylinder. It was pretty easy to bolt up, all things considered. The car&rsquo;s got a lot of things in common with its Mazda partners, it just makes 140 horsepower instead of 63. As you can imagine, that gets the car down the road in a hurry.</p>
<p>I hear a belt squeal and the odour of coolant and burning clutch fills the air around Chuck’s. I involuntarily shudder before turning and seeing a Ford Aspire, the sole occupant of it beaming with joy at having a vintage hot-rod like mine.</p>

<p>I slam my hand into the main shifter, grabbing onto a blinking 8-ball and shoving the transmission into third. My fingers roll off the knob in a spiderlike bundle onto the range selector, flicking the polycarbonate skull’s eyes from red to blue as the gearbox bangs into single underdrive. I resume my brutal assault on the Detroit’s internals without so much as breathing on the clutch pedal, inwardly pleased that I can drive this twin-stick diesel beast like an old school long-haul trucker.</p><p>The Corvette and I go back not so long compared to my other cars; the battered ‘70 showed up as part of a multi-car auction that I inexplicably won after my ridiculous drunken lowball bid. All the other cars departed long ago, but the Corvette somehow stayed and mutated, like stubborn homeowners refusing to abandon the equity in their Chernobyl fixer-upper.</p><p>Over the years the fence-quality candy apple custom paintjob melted off the front of the car. For awhile the car was used as a test surface for spray paints of various techniques and materials, but it appears to have finally settled on a combination of wind-blasted rattle can black and sunburnt body damage for its mating plumage.</p><p>Beneath the capacious yet still crudely Sawzalled fiberglass hood, an angry Detroit Diesel 4-53 two stroke pounds away at its motor mounts and flywheel like they owe it money. Keeping an engine like this on the boil is no easy task, between its nega-Honda redline and ear-bleeding volume at virtually every RPM other than idle. That’s where the twin stick comes in.</p><p>The original manufacturer of this Corvette would be aghast to see what has become of what they laughably called frame rails. In order to fit the elephantine transmission, there was no shortage of hammer and dolly - mostly hammer - work involved.</p><p>My reverie about the cleverness of the build comes to a short end as I stop for a stoplight, being able to hear the stereo for the first time in about an hour. A 1979 VW Rabbit cabriolet pulls up next to me. The owner grins, revs the engine and emits a compelling turbo shriek and dark clouds of rich exhaust from a hidden side exit vacuum cutout. I raise my eyebrow, now finally intrigued.</p>

<p>The board room was a shock of walnut amidst a comforting cloud of teak. I couldn’t stop myself from wondering how much furniture polish they used.</p><p>Across the desk from me, my so-called representative (representative of what?) eagerly told me about the huge royalties I was getting from my breakout work, <i>Trans Am Acceptance</i>. It goes without saying that I was becoming deeply uncomfortable with the entire conversation, especially when he started to lush pre-baked praise upon me from some hidden pineal-esque gland.</p><p>As the agent spoke further I began to hear nothing but a dense television static, replacing all comprehension. My mind flitted, seeking answers to my current predicament and the root of my creative dissatisfaction.</p><p>A jingling happened beneath the desk. I looked down to see that I had involuntarily thumbed my remote car starter, which began to flash a series of lights indicating the preparation of the car’s subsystems. From somewhere deep within the concrete-framed structure I could feel its power emerge. The agent continued to talk, tried to get my attention, but it was never his in the first place.</p><p>I broke into a sprint as I left the meeting room. Before long, the laggardy normal-people elevator had dropped 53 floors to the lowest level of the parkade. By this point the sound of the warbling Eaton blower and the enormous fuel pumps shoving raw nitromethane into the fiery hells that filled each of its eight copious cylinders was a distinct and physical presence in the darkened parkade.</p><p>They asked me where the advance on my book had gone. Perhaps I had sent it up my nose, they whispered to me in a mock conspiracy. If they had read the book, I replied, they would have known.</p><p>A long time ago, as a child, I fell down a well. It felt like I had fallen forever. I was trapped at the bottom for hours. One of the firemen lowered a car magazine for me to read to pass the time, quell my panic. The first page was a prophecy, a dark bolt that hurled the charred embers of my predestined suburbanite life so far and so wide that no person could ever put it back together again.</p><p>A 1160-horsepower twincharged AMC Eagle was something that was meant to be, theorized in obscure religious dogma between the two dog-eared covers of that magazine. It would have been rude to delay its birth any longer.</p>

<p>I always wanted to see Italy, but I didn’t think it would be like this.</p><p>I shut the Trans Am’s copious hatch after maneuvering my weekly groceries around the WRC style x-bar cage. A long time ago I had welded bag hooks to the cage, and I snickered at all of those suckers having to leave their groceries bouncing around in the trunk when they did 1G corners or block-long savage burnouts that resulted in tire carcasses being ejected the length of a football field.</p><p>On the way home, though, something weird was up with the Trans Am. It seemed like the steering would only go one direction, like the brakes and the power steering pump were fighting me. Accustomed to this car’s eccentricities, I sighed and then started to go along with what it seemingly wanted. I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t start to worry as the hours in the car started to tick upwards after we merged onto a major highway.</p><p>Eventually, we came to an empty clearing, the title to which would have arrived in my mailbox the next week, arranged for a relatively low fee which the Trans Am had somehow negotiated for. The massive Pontiac flared its exhaust and jumped into a sea can parked at the back of the lot. Then the doors shut.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, I could feel movement, noise from outside. I would yell, but nobody would hear me. I subsisted by rationing the groceries from the hatch of the Pontiac, waiting for the doors to open and discover where the F-body had duped me into going this time. It had to be far, I reasoned, based on the gentle sea rocking of the canister. Good thing neither of us were prone to sea sickness.</p><p>Eventually my phone burst to life, having been re-established within roaming distance of a phone provider that my telco had reached an agreement with in a shadowy backroom. Hundreds of text messages poured in from acquaintances wondering where I had gone. My boss was threatening my dismissal. I shrugged and pulled up the GPS, which couldn’t get a decent lock through the wall of the sea can.</p><p>I felt a crane pick up the sea can, and then the doors began to creak open. My travelling companion flashed its emergency lights, telling me it was time to get inside and discover the countryside.</p><p>And what a countryside it was. The port of Naples, drenched in fish guts and the refuse of the sea. This goddamn car had smuggled me into Italy.</p><p>We arrived a few days later, after having gotten into multiple confrontations and narrow escapes from the Carabinieri, their confusion at seeing a car with bizarre license plates and enormous baby-seal-clubbing meats in the rear evident on their faces as they disappeared into the fog of my rear view mirror.</p><p>The organizer smiled as we approached, said something in high-octane Italian that I couldn’t quite comprehend. Handed me a form, clearly a waiver in any language. A banner above him read: “MILLE MIGLIA.”</p><p>A vintage postwar Alfa Romeo was ahead of us. The turbocharged 474 under my hood growled in a high-revving mockery of the thoroughbred’s vintage exhaust scream.</p>

<p>It was weird how we came to meet one another.</p><p>I would pass this abandoned gravel lot every day. I thought about parking in it to save a few bucks on my daily commute, but wondered if the landowner would have me towed or worse. Still, the lot stuck in my mind, and one day I screwed up the courage to visit it, to see if I could see any markings as to the ownership.</p><p>As my exocaged Forester rolled its heinously oversized Super Swampers over the curb to enter the lot, the gauge cluster went nuts. Obscene temperatures, a pinned tachometer, a speedometer that flailed like a morse code telegram. The clock showed an impossible hour. Spooked, I reversed out of the lot.</p><p>The next day I drove by and saw this brown Firebird. Not a Firebird, I realized, a Trans Am. In chocolate brown. I ran my eyes along its flanks and spotted the telltale power bulge of a Turbo.</p><p>I visited the car, walking into the lot on foot, and idly noticed my iPhone was also going nuts. The lock-screen clock had set itself to the same impossible hour, but one minute advanced from what the Forester had seen. The air around the lot seemed still even as there was a haunting dust devil pursuing me within it. It pelted me with gravel, grass and dirt, but I disregarded it. I reached out for the Trans Am and the mini-tornado dissipated into thin air. Its massive gold basketweaves glinted in the morning sunlight, seeming wider than stock to my pre-coffee mind. I was drawn to know more about this car, to feel its presence in my life, but every sense told me to retract my hand, to make no human contact - or contract - with this machine.</p><p>On the windshield dash plate, the VIN markings were obliterated, as if by an angle grinder. As I scrutinized the plate further, the grinder markings began to swim and shift before my eyes. I blinked in confusion, and the markings became still once more. I could not stop myself from reaching into my pocket, extracting a business card, and placing it beneath the wipers, sealing what I later realized was the Contract for life and beyond.</p><p>The next day, I began backing out of my suburban two-car garage only to see a car parked at the bottom of my driveway, preventing egress. I was enraged, of course, how dare this redneck trash park his brown Pontiac in my path? This wasn’t a cinder block showroom, after all.</p><p>Stepping out of my idling slammed V8 Cherokee, I stomped over to the Trans Am in a rage, only to find the door unlocked and the title stuck under the wiper with a crude note, written in the crude block-letter scrawl of madness: “YOU’RE WELCOME.”</p><p>Over the next few years, I would make multiple attempts to call General Motors for more information about the car. Perhaps they could send me the option package, or the build sheet, or anything. There were never any records of the car’s existence or manufacture; the assembly line had been shut down by the putative build date expressed by the door jamb info plate.</p><p>Parts ordered from RockAuto would not always fit the Trans Am, as if it rejected the concept of the pedestrian commuter part and demanded something new, vibrant. At the time I didn’t realize that while I modified it, it also modified me. I could feel its hand at work when I made immense JEGS and Olsbergs purchases, happily accepted within the two-door Pontiac with a surprising lack of fabrication required. It was pulling me along a path to build something - but what?</p><p>I continued to pursue the General Motors phone tree, needing to know where this Turbo had come from. Once I got as far as the oldest surviving engineer in the Pontiac division at the time. He called me late at night, from home, in a drunken tizzy. He assured me that he was half a bottle of sherry down and was ready to pass into the next world. The engineer was hysterical, screaming unintelligible stories about prophecies and dark spirits that were unearthed when the Van Nuys plant expanded to a nearby Indian burial ground. I was scared, and didn’t ask the relevant questions, but got the gist of it.</p><p>When I next got into the Pontiac, it refused to idle. It was angry at me for trying to take some of its mystery out of the world. A beast possessed, it sprayed a Herbie-esque stream of 5W40 Brad Penn onto the floor of my unassuming domestic garage. The radio flipped on and rapidly oscillated through stations, at first an undecipherable crescendo of syllables but gradually forming into recognizable English words telling me in no uncertain terms that it had “cash for clunkersed” the GM engineer I had just spoken to. After that, it stalled, and would not restart for weeks.</p><p>

I could not tell the police. They would never believe me, and in the worst case I would end up on Death Row in Michigan - two thousand miles and one border away - for murdering the engineer, who had been pinned beneath his exploding Chevy Volt by an unknown assailant last night. I had no real alibi, having been at home attempting to string-align my bored and stroked MG Midget.

<br/></p><p>I threatened the car with resale, and went so far as to attempt to tow it to Carmax in order to get rid of it to some spiteful hee-haw commuter whore who desperately wanted to emulate Burt Reynolds, perhaps spraypaint a firechicken on the hood in his spare time between slinging artisanal microbrews and urinating on fine art. The tow truck driver assured me that the sheared off bolts on his tow arm and the complete destruction of his PTO shaft and the transmission behind it was unusual, he had never seen it before, and he wished me great luck in being able to move this car, before involuntarily saying prayers in Spanish - a language he didn’t even speak - and fleeing on foot into the night, leaving the shattered bulk of his tow truck behind for another man less lucky than he.</p><p>Haunted, I would awaken at night to sit in front of the Pontiac, its bulk seeming to fill the garage, being bigger than it had any right to be. It scratched at the corners of my mind, threatening to burst free and drive me to madness.</p><p>I don’t know which sleepless night made it happen, but it did. I found myself in the garage, unable to free the throbbing twinge of pain from my mind.</p><p>Overwhelmed, I tentatively reached out, hands shaking with fear, and patted the urethane bumper cover gently while reassuring the Pontiac that it was a “good car” and we were going to have some adventures together. It immediately fired up, deafening me and filling the room with a staccato burst of what seemed like laughter before settling into a kittenesque purr of a perfect, happy idle.</p><p>Was that really how we met? Everything is a little blurry when it comes to this car.</p>

<p>I could see it all from my perch at the restaurant, trying to engage in conversation with my lovely companion while also keeping an eye on the unfolding anthropological experiment. The Trans Am Turbo wasn’t my usual date-night vehicle, but then this wasn’t your usual date night.</p><p>The oldest and most experienced of the valets stepped forward through the quivering wall of terrified newbies, shoving the smallest of them aside, considering him with a half-sneered contempt as he confidently reached out and grabbed the polished stainless-steel button that would release the compressed-air central locking system. On cue, the beast burst forth with 30psi of built-up pressure, causing the nearest of the junior valets to involuntarily void his bowels.</p><p>This was going to be no ordinary drive to the storage lot, but the gravity of the story he had just written himself into had managed to escape him up until this point. Presumably he had been getting baked with the short-order chef in the alley, hadn’t seen, heard or <i>felt</i> the brutish Pontiac arrive and so was happy in his hubris to discard the advice that his amygdalae were screaming at him, drowned out by the need to be stronger - a more suitable mate - than the herd.<br/></p><p>His memory of his frumpy wife, a long-distant bar room conquest, kissing him goodbye in the morning had began to fade as surely as the interior carpet of the Trans Am. He stepped over the WRC door bars, grabbed ahold of the engine start switch and engaged it, and then he truly knew fear.</p><p>I chuckled in half-empathy, remembering my first time with the Turbo.<br/></p><p>I wasn’t worried for its health. I learned early on that any door dings, scrapes or frame bendings that it had picked up during the course of its adventures would heal gradually with the sickening crush of popping metal after long enough parked in the garage. It was as if the crude F-body refused to accept an interpretation of reality in which it was not on the streets, not running. I would find that cars parked next to it would develop spontaneous battery drains, with the Trans Am sitting appealingly next to their dead shells, its pearl chocolate paint glowing softly in the vaseline-soaked dream that my garage fluorescents promoted.</p><p>The Pontiac engaged the central locking without his request, and he could see the hood-mounted boost gauge gently throbbing, its retrofit OLEDs burning a hole through his optical nerve directly into the parietal lobe. Before the Turbo, he was a normal man, with hopes, dreams and fears. After the Turbo, he was a passenger.</p><p>I returned to the conversation with my dinner date, trying not to jump in on her sentences about her day job with interjections about carburetors or LD28 cranks. She would never understand the Trans Am, especially after she saw what it had done later that night.</p>

<p>Detective Kronowski awoke in his squalid one-bedroom studio apartment and began his morning preparation. Brushing, shaving, polishing of his shoulder holster. It was a morning like any other.</p><p>Kronowski washed his face in the sink and then stepped out into his living room, heavily laden with greasy pizza boxes. One wall was completely dominated by a cork bulletin board.</p><p>The board had pictures of one man - hundreds of them - of him doing things like checking tire pressure at autocross, fixing rust, doing a ghetto string alignment, throwing out clutch slave cylinders in the city garbage cans. Red yarn was stretched between many of the pictures, hung by enormous push pins. He had written revelations and outstanding questions on his clue board, with cryptic engravings like “17KPH OVER???” and “BFG G-FORCE RIVALS????” strewn on 3M sticky notes of various colours. This bulletin board was the massive black hole left from the collapse of the dwarf star that once anchored Kronowski’s tiny galaxy.</p><p>Kronowski stepped into his STR-classed 2003 NB2 and fired up the buzzy four-pot. All 1,883 cubic centimeters of his secret overbore thrummed gently in front of the firewall. He stopped at Tim Hortons for a coffee - <i>black</i>, he’d growl - on his way to the pock-marked and worn airfield that would serve as a suitable backdrop for a tense undercover operation. Secretly, the detective worried that the off-camber corners on the back straight would throw the rear end out, destroy his chances for the running.</p><p>The operation had difficulties before - once, one of the other men in the organization he had infiltrated noticed his secret overbore, could not ignore the tooling marks and grease pencil of a well known engine builder in town. Kronowski couldn’t afford to be protested, to have his true loyalties unveiled. The rat was eliminated from competition shortly after, swept down upon by uniforms who beat him with a phonebook - those were getting hard to find, weren’t they? - and left him at the city outskirts with an impound bill for his SM ‘89 EF.</p><p>Detective Kronowski snapped out of his reverie, having spotted his target. He would learn so much from him today, and help build the case for when he finally moved to take down his criminal enterprise of loud exhausts and mild speeding.</p>

<p>I REACH OVER THE COUNTER AND GRAB A FIST FULL OF BUTTERSCOTCH ICE CREAM. THIS IS GONNA BE ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS.</p><p>I WAS WORKING MY NIGHT JOB AS AN ICE CREAM DELIVERY TECHNICIAN FOR A LOCAL CHAIN OF ICE CREAM TRUCKS. THEY HAD AUTHORIZED THE USE OF COMPANY FUNDS FOR REPAIR OR UPGRADE TO THE TRUCK AS I SAW FIT.</p><p>THIS WAS OF COURSE IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD BEFORE THEY FIRED ME FOR RUNNING UP A FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL BY PUTTING A WEIAND BLOWER AND SEMI-SLICKS ON THE BACK OF THE CAGED AND CHOPPED PANEL VAN BODY. THEY DIDN’T EVEN MENTION THE FIRE-BREATHING HANDBUILT LINGENFELTER 527. DURING MY EXIT INTERVIEW WITH HUMAN RESOURCES I DOCUMENTED THIS OBVIOUS LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL AS A PRIMARY FAILING THAT THEY SHOULD SEEK TO IMPROVE.</p><p>THAT SAID, THE ICE CREAM TRUCK WAS THE FINEST THING I HAD EVER DRIVEN. I COULD SATURATION-BOMB AN ENTIRE INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOOD WITH ROCKY ROAD AND SPIDERMAN THEMED POPSICLE-ANALOGUES BEFORE THE POLICE OR OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD CATCH UP TO THE BOX AT THE END OF THE FLAMING TIRE TRACKS THROUGHOUT THEIR TOWN. THE KIDS LOVED IT TOO ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM COMPLAINED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE ICE CREAM MAN’S JINGLE OVER THE SOUND OF A MASSIVE PUSHROD BLOCK INGESTING THOUSANDS OF LITERS OF AIR PER SECOND. KIDS THESE DAYS ARE SHIT.</p><p>ANYWAY, ONE OF THE DAYS BEFORE I GET FIRED I AM TRAVELLING A REASONABLE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT IN THE LEFT LANE OF THE MAJOR TRI-STATE INTERSTATE WHEN WHAT I LATER IDENTIFY TO THE POLICE AS “SOME KIND OF FERRARI” PULLS ALONGSIDE ME AND HONKS THREE TIMES, SIGNIFYING THEIR INTENT TO PERFORM A STREET RACE.</p><p>I ACTIVATE THE PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEM, TEMPORARILY SWITCHING OFF “POP GOES THE WEASEL” (REPEATING ITSELF FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME) AND ADDRESS THE PUBLIC.</p><p>IN A SNIT, THE ITALIAN HOTROD SPEEDS OFF INTO THE DISTANCE, PRESUMABLY CHALLENGING MY MANHOOD AND EXPENSE ACCOUNT. THE JOKE’S ON HIM, I THINK, AS I DROP THE TRUCK INTO SINGLE OVERDRIVE AND MASH THE FLOOR-HINGED BILLET TITANIUM GAS PEDAL. WARP SPEED ENSUES.</p><p>AT THESE SPEEDS A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DON’T REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW FAST THEY ARE GOING. THIS IS FACTUALLY ACCURATE. IN FACT, I RARELY IF EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT I AM DOING. IN THIS WAY I AM ENSURED TO HAVE MANY EXCITING ADVENTURES AND PRESERVE THE MYSTERIES OF MODERN LIFE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.</p><p>THE FERRARI HAS GOTTEN VERY LARGE AND THEN SUDDENLY VERY SMALL, EXCEPT NOW IN ONE OF MY VOLUMINOUS WING MIRRORS. THE ICE CREAM TRUCK IS BEGINNING TO RATTLE.</p><p>A FEW HOURS LATER BOTH OF US ARE IN THE CITY JAIL, SEPARATED BY THE BARS. I CAN SEE THAT HE AND I ARE NOT VERY DIFFERENT, PERHAPS ALTERED BY OUR RESPECTIVE HORRIFIC CHILDHOODS. I ASK HIM ABOUT WHICH EIGHTIES CARTOON CHARACTERS HE WANTED TO HUMP, BUT HE DOES NOT RESPOND.</p><p>SORE LOSER, I GUESS.</p>

<p>For a few years, ever since I moved into the neighborhood, the guy on the next street over had had this old Oldsmobile sitting in his driveway chocked to keep it from rolling back. On my daily constitutional I would see the car rotting slowly, its state degrading, the rust and sun damage competing with one another to see who would claim this car for their champion.</p><p>Last month, I was struck by a sudden urge to develop a new project. But Kijiji was bare, you see, and in a burst of absinthe fueled purestrain madness I stepped out into my backyard cradling my Harbor Freight “Earthquake” impact gun looking for anything - anything at all - that I could hop up. Rice. Enfasten and enlouden. You know how it is with me. We’ve known each other long enough.</p><p>That’s when I saw it.</p><p>Over the previous few weeks I’ve been sneaking out after dark and fixing this guy’s car for him. Surely he’s noticed by now. Some kind of Keebler elf - is that the right thing? The shoe guy, you know. A Keebler elf deal. That seems right. Yeah, anyway, I would fix up his car for him but I had never thought of the endpoint because - as you well know by now - I have literally never finished a project before.</p><p>But this one, this one I finished.</p><p>When I knew he was out of his house for the evening I fired up the Delta and listened to its gentle idle. The car was running. It was fixed! This Olds even made a little more power than it came from the factory with, thanks to some creative ignition timing and a gently ported intake manifold.</p><p>So the car’s fixed, it’s done, I did in a few weeks what the owner couldn’t do in a decade.</p><p>Naturally what I did next was try to recoup the capital I had spent on his car. I put it on Kijiji, thinking that I would just split whatever we made 50-50 and everyone would be happy. The smartphone-equipped snoops on his block would stop ratting his car out to the bylaw police, he would have his driveway space back, and I would make some money.</p><p>But what happened next was crazy.</p><p>It turns out that this specific year and trim package of Delta was highly valuable, and I began to see a variety of Barrett Jackson motherfuckers showing up in the neighborhood, driving their Swarovski-crystalled Escalade tow vehicles. They would spend all this time crowing to themselves about the concours-correctness of the parched beige dash pad and then walk up the street to me and offer me $200 “for the tires, the rest of it is junk.” Fuck those guys. I would spit in their faces.</p><p>So we went to Barrett-Jackson. I remember you didn’t ask a lot of questions about where that car that was on the back of our ramp truck came from. Well&hellip;</p><p>After we got back from Vegas, I went to knock on the neighbor’s door. Surely he would be excited that I had not only fixed his car but netted each of us a cool million and a half dollars!</p><p>So that brings us to the present day. What do I need you to do? Go home, and go get the Trans Am Turbo. It’ll <i>tell</i> you what to do. We’re gonna post bail.</p>

<p>I went for the horn and the world exploded.</p><p>In a devastating haze of fire I saw in my mind’s eye rod pins separating from their overstressed charges, buckling piston rings and finally the crankshaft collapsing in upon itself.</p><p>But maybe I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><p>Like all great adventures, this one began at the Enterprise Rent-A-Car desk. I had ordered economy small, my usual order, which almost always ended up with me getting a Fiat 500 “Pop” - the buzzy yet truly authentic steed that I could remember so many foreign adventures with. But this day would be different, and the eponymous gate wasn’t the only departure the airport had in store for me.</p><p>I felt the cold grasp of pure fear grip my heart as the wrinkled authoritarian behind the desk drew her lips back into the reptilian approximation of a sneer. I knew that I had made a fatal mistake and froze, like a deer in the headlights, already dreading the words.</p><p>“We’re out of Fiats. You’re getting a Nissan Versa.”<br/></p><p>The words hit me like a 13B with functional fifth and sixth ports. I could feel my knees sag as my world darkened around me.</p><p>“Surely there must be some mistake,” I managed to stammer out, scrambling to right myself, “I’m a Gold customer. Gold customers don’t <i>deserve</i> the Nissan Versa. Can’t you bump me up to Compact class? I swear to your fucking God I’ll drive a Sonic!”</p><p>It was no use.</p><p>I found myself driving the hateful Versa through town, trying not to look at what I could only assume were the contemptuous sneers of my fellow road users. That’s when I figured out what to do.</p><p>Pulling into the NAPA parking lot, I left the Versa running - its keyless system is confusing to me, I’ll tell them if it gets stolen - and asked the clerk to price me out a 150-shot Edelbrock kit.</p><p>I guess there’s a reason they call it giggle gas, because I couldn’t stop laughing when the tow truck pulled up to the airport lot.</p>

<p>THE WAITRESS ASKS ME WHERE I AM GOING WITH MY CAR, WHICH IS PARKED OUTSIDE. I RESPOND WITH SOME DEGREE OF CONFUSION AS THIS CAR IS NEVER ONE THAT YOU SHOULD DRIVE TO “GO SOMEWHERE.” SHE ROLLS HER EYES AND DEPARTS TO THE KITCHEN, PRESUMABLY TO ORDER THE CHEF TO SPIT IN MY CLUB SANDWICH. THE JOKE’S ON HER BECAUSE THAT’LL BE THE CLOSEST THING TO MOIST THAT MONTH-OLD HOSPITAL MEAT HAS EVER BEEN.</p><p>EVENTUALLY I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MY EXISTENCE. THIS IS BECAUSE I AM BACK BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE 1981 TRANS AM TURBO. I DO A CELEBRATORY BURNOUT AT THE NEXT STOPLIGHT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ATTRACTS THE ATTENTION OF DEDICATED ONLOOKERS.</p><p>ONE SUCH ONLOOKER IS REFERENCED IN THE LITERATURE AS “THE FUZZ,” BUT THAT’S NOT MY PRIMARY OR EVEN TERTIARY CONCERN AT THIS MOMENT. THE OPPONENT THAT HAS RE-EMERGED IN THIS TIMEFRAME CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS PRESUMED DEAD CANADIAN AUTHOR FARLEY MOWAT. THE PUTATIVE ENVIRONMENTALIST IS DRIVING WHAT I NOW NOTICE IS AN EXO-CAGED AND GENTLY LIFTED 1967 PONTIAC FIREBIRD, ANGRILY SHIFTING ON ITS KNOBBY TIRES.</p><p>I CAN ONLY ASSUME HE HAS SOUGHT ME OUT BASED ON MY LATEST EDITORIAL IN MACLEANS. HE IS SURELY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT PAUL WELLS OWED ME A FAVOUR AFTER HELPING HIM ADJUST THE CARB ON HIS BORED AND STROKED 1987 RAMCHARGER.</p><p>ONCE THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN THE BOTH OF US ARE OFF, CANADIAN LITERARY SENSATIONS PREPARING TO DO BATTLE IN OUR SAVAGE F-BODIES. FARLEY’S MATTE BLACK FLAME-SPITTING CAMARO-ANALOGUE SURELY HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE TRANS AM TURBO, AND I CRANK UP THE MANUAL BOOST CONTROLLER WITH MY RIGHT HAND WHILE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE AXLE TRAMP IN PLAY UNDER WIDE OPEN THROTTLE, THE TRACTOR-ESQUE REAR SUSPENSION NOW LEAPING LIKE SWAN LAKE BETWEEN THE RUTS IN THIS RURAL BACKROAD.</p><p>BEHIND US, A PURSUIT-SPECIFICATION TAURUS POLICE INTERCEPTOR SCREAMS ITS ECONOMY-CAR TWIN TURBOCHARGED V6 TO A MONUMENTAL REDLINE, ITS OVERWHELMED AND CONFUSED AUTOMATIC MAKING VISIBLY SAVAGE SHIFTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PLEASE THE TWIN MASTERS OF SAFETY AND VIOLENCE. THE TAURUS FLAILS AT AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IN A SERENE RAGE WORTHY OF THE MOST DEPRESSED ZEN MASTER IN HISTORY. THE MATH IS SIMPLE. IT IS NO LONGER A CONCERN OF EITHER OF US. I KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE PLACE THAT THE FIREBIRD CANNOT FOLLOW ME, AND I MAKE A BEELINE ACROSS THE TOWN IN PURSUIT OF MY NEW SINGULAR GOAL.</p><p>I JAG THE TRANS AM HARD LEFT, ACROSS A SIDEWALK AND THROUGH A BACKYARD. IT BELLOWS LIKE A WOUNDED BEAST, NEITHER ONE OF US EVER BEFORE TRULY KNOWING A WORTHY OPPONENT. I STRIKE A TEMPORARY SWIMMING POOL WITH THE FRONT DRIVERS’ SIDE CORNER, LAUNCHING IT ACROSS MY DEPARTING PATH IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT IT WILL SLOW THE IRREPLACEABLE CANADIAN TREASURE WHO LEFT US FAR TOO SOON FOR JUST ONE MORE CORNER.</p><p>MY DRIVING GLOVES SLIDE ACROSS THE STEERING WHEEL AS I GO FOR ONE MORE WRC-STYLE UPSHIFT ON THE LENGTHENED COMPRESSED-AIR SHIFTER, SHOCKING THE REAR WHEELS FREE DESPITE MY NEARLY PERFECT FLAT SHIFT. THE TRANS AM TURBO STEPS OUT SIDEWAYS, STUMBLING, AS THE FIREBIRD BEARS DOWN UPON IT SO CLOSE I CAN SEE ONLY THE ELECTRICAL-TAPE X ON EACH OF HIS FOUR MASSIVE XENON RALLY LIGHTS IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR. MY TARGET IS COMING UP FAST NOW. I STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TRANS AM, TAKING A SMALL BLAST IN THE REAR QUARTER FROM THE FARLEYBIRD, AND PUNCH IT AGAIN.</p><p>THE TWO OF US SMASH THROUGH THE LOBBY OF A TUNA CANNERY. I CAN SENSE HIS DISCOMFORT, HIS BETRAYAL. I KNOW NOW THAT I WAS LUCKY. ON THIS DAY, I SURVIVED. MOWAT SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES, ENORMOUS DUST CLOUDS ERUPTING FROM THE HEINOUS TROPHY TRUCK TIRES, AND CUTS HARD RIGHT, DEMOLISHING A CARGO DOOR LEADING TO THE MAIN OFFICES.</p><p>WE - THE TRANS AM AND I, FOREVER INSEPARABLE THROUGH SO MANY ACTIVITIES - ROLL TO A STOP IN THE LOBBY, SCATTERING PERIODICALS FROM THE WAITING ROOM ACROSS ITS FORMERLY IMMACULATE TILE FLOOR.</p><p>MY PHONE RINGS AND I ANSWER IT, TAPPING THE ZIP-TIED BLUETOOTH ANSWER BUTTON. IT’S THE CAPILANO REVIEW. THEY SAY THEY’VE HEARD THAT I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT SMART CARS AND URBAN DENSIFICATION.</p><p>I RAISE MY VOICE TO DROWN OUT THE BELLOW OF A SUPERCHARGED LS7 DEMOLISHING FILING CABINETS IN THE BACKGROUND, AND ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.</p>

<p>Righty-tighty, lefty loosey, I thought as I completed the torque sequence for the final head bolt. The stretched bolt, amongst its friends, would now hold together the demented club sandwich of my savagely overboosted SR20 as it screamed to what can only be described as a tragicomic redline.</p><p>After the engine was dropped into the bay and I fired it up, I became all too aware of a dark presence in the seat next to me. Daring not turn my head to look over and confirm either of the forerunning diagnoses of my mental state, I calmly shifted the thuggish Borg Warner into reverse.</p><p>I started to back the Datsun out into the sun-scorched second reel of my student film. The substructure of the 620 flexed, creaking and groaning as it became used to its new fender flares, its massive spongy drag radials, a growing sense of intolerance in its chest.</p><p>As I went to roll the drivers’ side window up to guard my eyes from any tire marbles that might bounce backward during the next 35 minutes of burnouts, I caught a glimpse of my next-door neighbor. He was standing on his lawn, angry, cellphone in hand. It seems he had come home early, and was wondering who had been using his modest two-car garage while he was on vacation.</p>

<p>I looked around the table at my new coworkers, who were discussing lease incentives and sales rebates and the intricacies of warranty service. I was rapt with terror, knowing that soon they would ask me the dreaded question. As if on cue, they did.</p><p>I stammered out a series of half-apologies, brushing my infuriating car collection off as just some old junk. But one of my coworkers was lulled to further attention, wishing to interrogate me about my car selection.</p><p>As I went further and further into detail about the 560fwhp Honda Fit which had carried me to my daily grind, I could tell all eyes were on me, white with terror. I had gone too far, tipped my hand, let the mask slip just this once before them. My cadence accelerated as I panicked, all but screaming out a conversational aside about my dune buggy Fiero project, thinking they would all find that highly unique and therefore cool.</p>

<p>You know how we do it! Today on Drivin’ &amp; Countin’ we found this incredibly rare 1968 Camaro RS in some guy’s backyard! Turns out it’s in mint condition and all we have to do is a quick flip.</p><p>But wait, there’s a horrific problem with the <i>rear axle</i> that might keep us from making a mint on this one! And I have to manage my restaurant!</p><p>More problems on the Camaro project! I’d better buy another car to hedge against the pain that I’m going to suffer at auction. I bought a Lincoln Town Car limousine, how crazy is that? So crazy. It’s <i>zany</i> is how crazy it is.</p><p>Oh man! The project is getting derailed even further! I can’t believe this! Now it’s turned out that there are <i>rusty bolts</i> on the suspension! Better pull an all-nighter to get it done in time for the big show!</p><p>Well, at the end of the week this episode on Drivin’ and Countin’ it turns out that I’m the only guy who works here and I didn’t bother to turn a single wrench. So I’m down $67,000, but I listed all of the cars involved on Kijiji for several multiples of their Barrett-Jackson value (I am absolutely sure I will get a caller any second now), so let’s just call it a $1 million profit for the week.</p><p>Tune in next week when I proceed to buy a really shitty house in a bad neighborhood and turn it into a $600,000 profit by applying the same products you see on the commercial breaks!</p>

<p>It was time for my high school reunion. Of course it was.</p><p>The hardest choice of them all was ahead of me - what was I going to wear?</p><p>I stepped out into the garage to contemplate my options. I made a short list of the running cars and the cars that I think I could get working if the house were burning down around me. It was a really short list.</p><p>So I thought about <i>buying</i> a new car. But my Kijiji watch list emails had been coming up short the last couple of days. Each notification was more of a reassurance that my fetishistic car tastes were shared with approximately zero people than it was a new opportunity to buy a new metal friend. I calmly scrubbed through the mail inbox, looking for any notification email that was even serviceable.</p><p>That’s when I saw it. The choice seemed obvious.</p><p>Later that night, I kicked the side-oiler into unconsciousness by way of a phone book to the intake manifold and strode inside the high school gymnasium which had once been my whole world. I wondered if they recognized me, but I didn’t have to wonder for long.</p><p>All throughout the night people would approach me and discuss my wasted potential, would stare into my eyes like I had some kind of accident and woke up like this.</p><p>“I always thought you were going to be the next Bill Gates or something,” they’d say. “What happened to you, man?”</p><p> I wanted to scream back, the cars did this to me. I need counselling, I need help. But there was always just a plaintive grunt, a shrug and an attempt to move the subject along to how many kids the other entity had produced.<br/></p><p>After far too long, I excused myself and retreated back to the parking lot. There, the Talladega sat. It took up far too much of its allocated parking spot, and the massive mudders and crudely fabricated raw tinwork box flares didn’t help its city manners any either.</p><p>But she was sitting on the hood, waiting for me to realize where I belonged and come back.</p>

<p>I popped a bootlegger turn in the Galaxie, then floored the gas so hard that the pedal arm burst through the rotted-out floorboards.</p><p>The car responded, its sawzall’d exhaust screaming as the intricately balanced FE raced to its stratospheric superbike redline. A massive roostertail of stones and grit and rust flared up behind me, momentarily ringing my corroded war steed in a cloud of nature’s own wrath as its million-lumen sunburn headlights cut through it like the gaze of God.</p><p>In front of me now was the Acura MDX, its driver rapidly throwing it into reverse and peeling out. The smell of fear, brake fluid and all-season performance radials filled the air. They were attemping to return their lives to the parched highway road that represented to them civilization, law, order, structure, belief in a hierarchy, and protection from karmic justice.</p><p>But the Galaxie had other plans. I could feel every inch of its pockmarked, sandblasted unibody lurch under the strain produced by its space-age powertrain, the forces at once both alien and familiar. When I look back on it, I don’t think I could have stopped the Galaxie from doing what it was born to do that night.</p><p>The car and I met decades ago, in an old coot’s back yard. Back then it was a mere six cylinder - Ford’s contempt sneering right down to the “Thriftpower” name - and rapidly rotting through under the lack of attention of its previous owner. We shook, and a not-negligible amount of bills rapidly found its way out of my upper-middle-class, office-job bank account. The price? Thirty pieces of silver, I was convinced, with two thousand years of inflation on top.</p><p>Over the years between then and now, the Galaxie began to twist itself. Sometimes I would find myself at 3 AM in the garage, sitting in front of the car, contemplating it, with no idea of why or how I had gotten there. Parts arrived with mysterious credit card bills that I didn’t remember ordering. I felt compelled to turn bolts.</p><p>At first I fought it. I decided that I would spend time with friends, family, office obligations, social events, rather than work on the Galaxie. But then I would find myself back in the garage, installing a hydraulic brake booster or stiffening its rotted-out unibody with 1.750 x .120 DOM tubing. Sometimes I would ignore the car for months, and it would inevitably barf fluids or attempt to injure me as I walked past.</p><p>Eventually the car broke me.</p><p>It was a Sunday, one of those July weekend evenings that never end, the sun hanging low in the sky and the smell of hot pavement filling my nose. I had just finished installing a dry sump for the Galaxie - it had somehow demanded that I do so from Summit, though at the time I knew neither what a dry sump was or what the car was planning - and was getting ready for a test drive. After priming the oil pump I turned the key and let the car spring to life.</p><p>That was the first night.</p><p>The Galaxie and I had hunted down every major traffic offender we could find, drove them off the road, into signs, poles, ditches. One lifted brotruck was pushed into a pothole, split in half, and its shattered husk was sent tumbling into a roadside way-station.<br/></p><p>My recollection is hazy, but the newspaper the next morning spelled it all out in lurid detail. Spoke of a black car, driven by a demon. Editorials were calling for increased photo radar, stiffer demerits for texting and driving.</p><p>I stared, horrified. What had this car <i>done</i> to me?</p><p>I fled for the mountains. In the valleys and the twisties, I thought, the big Ford would finally be happy and stop its murderous rampage. I was wrong. The campaign of terror only continued there, bursting through rural fruit stands and cabin supply stores. The Ford was looking for something, had some kind of unearthly quest that forced it to come back to life and pick me as a vessel. I had no idea what it could be, and the thought terrified me.</p><p>It would snarl with disdain - or perhaps a vacuum leak - whenever it passed a Royal Purple ad. The full-size Ford spit flame and rocked on its ancient body mounts whenever it was restrained in stop and go traffic for too long, like a spirited colt that already knew the world was bullshit.</p><p>Every day was a new challenge to keep the car under control, to keep it from letting it do what it (and later, not so secretly, I) wanted. Out of fear more than obligation, I kept the cammer well fed and maintained. We were in it for the long haul, together.</p><p>And now we come to the present day. I had stopped at the Canadian Tire to pick up brake fluid and vise grips, and came out to see a black Acura MDX clip the rear quarter of the Galaxie when trying to back out. Surely he knew, and I shouted, but he left quickly into traffic.</p><p>Somehow the 427 was already running when my ass hit the seat.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, but especially the ladies, I’m proud to have been invited to this, the city’s first brainstorming event dedicated to urban sustainability. My topic is automobile traffic, and I’ve prepared a little PowerPoint presentation that I hope you will all find riveting.</p><p>The primary problem with existing traffic as it is is that everyone is bored to death. Shit just takes too long, and you’re waiting at the lights all the time. So people go text or check on their Angry Birds farm or heart Kim Kardashian’s butt. I’m gonna fix that first.</p><p>My plan has three stages. First, we’ll convert all existing turns to banked corners in accordance with FIA directives - and yes, <i>Councillor</i> Tony, that includes the FIA curbs. I think the candy-cane look of the curbs will help add to urban renewal and engender a sense of community among our citizens.</p><p>Next, we’ll look at existing traffic lights - and remove nearly all of them. In their place we’ll simply make people make three rights. Now, since we’re also removing most of the surface streets in this policy, it might take a bit longer, but I’m confident that driving patterns will adjust. For instance, we can replace tire shops with pit lanes along the highway, staffed by highly-paid and sharply-trained workers who can change a tire on a race-spec Camry in under 20 seconds. Now <i>that’s</i> putting efficiency back in the economy!</p><p>As a last part of my plan, we will unlock the Unlimited Speed class of drivers’ license. This license, which is presented only to those drivers who have a sufficiently prepared car (0.91 lateral Gs required, inspected yearly) and amateur or professional motorsports experience, will allow the driver in question to be immune from speed prosecution. By freeing up these better, more highly skilled drivers into their own private lanes, we will reduce congestion by approximately 97.5% over three years.</p><p>Questions?</p>

<p>So I’m sitting underneath my Subaru, trying to undo the front subframe bolts so I can get at the steering rack bushings, and these Jehovah’s Witnesses or something come. They ask me if I&rsquo;ve heard the <i>Word</i> of Christ, and I respond in the negative. The garage is my church and an unbroken line of profanity as I try to loosen a fucking god damn shoulder bolt from these shitfucking subframe-mount captive nuts is my Word.</p><p>When I finally get access to the drivers’ side steering rack bushing, they decide that they’ve had enough of talking to me, and leave.</p><p>As they’re walking out, some Mormons or something come. They ask me if I’ve ever read the Watchtower. I answer in the negative, and tell them that the only thing I read anymore is the Haynes manual for how to fix my fucking car, and the only ridiculous feel-good gospel that I still hang upon is “installation is the reverse of disassembly.”</p><p>Once I pop out the drivers’ side steering rack bushing by cutting it in half, they decide that I’m a lost cause, and leave.</p><p>A Mitsubishi owner rolls up outside my house, the eBay lip on his primered-out Evo V scraping against the curb of my driveway as he tries to pull in. Just as he’s asking me if I’ve let crankwalk into my heart, I hit the button on the garage door opener.</p>

<p>The Trans Am Turbo shuddered to sleep, its turbos wound down, and it was over.</p><p>I stepped out of the Pontiac into the shattered wreckage of the parts and service department. It was as if a bomb had gone off, but you should know better by now.</p><p>A sign advertising the relatively low cost of the shop’s transmission services broke free from its one remaining mounting chain and fell onto a Roadforce machine. I regarded it coolly, knowing that even if it were to tumble over and scratch my hood, that it wouldn’t even come close to the huge gashes put in my intricately slapped together Bondo-job by the parts counter itself. Faux-marble was a lot harder than I had counted on, but it too yielded to the Pontiac, my will made manifest and imposed upon the world.</p><p>I stretched my arms and rolled my head from shoulder to shoulder, trying to work out the kink that I picked up when my head hit the cage after the Turbo rammed its way through the trade-in lot’s back fence. Stepping across the foyer, my racing boots crunched broken safety (and un-safety) glass underfoot. What I wanted was behind the desk.</p><p>“C-can I have your VIN number?” screamed the parts desk representative. Challenged in his world view, he now resorted to a childlike understanding of his place in the universe, imperious to the last. This was going to get worse before it got better.</p>

<p>So I’m at this car auction, right? I bought an antique fire engine because it looked cool. Get it all fixed up and just leave it in my yard - I dunno what I’m gonna do with it, and race season is coming up.</p><p>Eventually the bylaw officers come by, ask me if I’m planning on doing anything with all these derelict cars. Caught in a bind, I panic and tell them that the fire engine is for the annual <i>parade</i> - surely a parade car must be exempt from the derelict car regulation, right? You don’t want to disappoint all those wonderful cherubic children, don’t want to have them wondering “where’s that cool fire truck?” You should’ve been there, it was the sales job of a lifetime.</p><p>Swayed by my newfound enthusiasm, the apparatchiks disperse, leaving me and my copse of mangled AMXes in peace. But now I need to figure out when the annual parade is.</p><p>So I call up my friend, Unsteady Ted, and ask him, you know, where the parade is? Ted thinks it’s probably this weekend - like going on <i>right now</i> - so I get the fire engine out of mothballs and start driving around the city looking for where the parade is supposed to stop. I’d phone Ted, but I’m already late, and distracted driving is the most dangerous thing you can do in a car!</p><p>Eventually I come across this car fire on the side of the road. This woman is standing next to her burning Sebring, distraught. She screams at me to put her car out, and I shake my head and try to communicate with her over the roar of the flames that I don’t have any water in my historical-replica fire truck. It’s been disarmed, I keep saying. She freaks out further, starts screaming (or at least I think it’s screaming - the windows on this old truck are surprisingly thick). After awhile of arguing the real fire department shows up and I beat a hasty retreat, the massive blower on the truck’s Detroit screaming its way to the hilariously low redline.</p><p>Finally I find what I think is the parade, and jam myself in between two huge black cars which I assume are carrying some kind of local sports team. These men start screaming and a helicopter is following me. Eventually I realize I’m stuck in the middle of a Presidential motorcade - this shit seems to happen to me <i>every fucking week,</i> traffic is off the hook terrible in this city - and everyone is very anxious for me to move on.</p><p>Anyway that’s why I’m late for the funeral. Dude’s still dead, right?</p>

<p>She looked upon my squalid garage paradise, staring at the non-running 1972 Ford Ranchero and the grotesque collection of parts that didn’t belong to it, and frowned. I knew that I had blown my chance to make a great first impression. How could I have been so stupid? It was one of the seven habits of highly effective teens.</p><p>She demanded to be taken home right then and there, and so I showed her to my efficient, reliable Japanese daily driver. When I hit the Engine Start button, the twin-rotor Weiand blower cried gently in the winter air, its vanes reaching for just one more molecule of oxygen.</p>

<p>I pushed the engine start button and my self-driving car sprung to life. &ldquo;OHAYO!&rdquo; it screamed at me in vocoded Japanese, with a distinctly unplaceable non-regional accent.</p><p>Ever since the Technologically Automated Transportation Act passed Congress in 2037, I’ve been regretting the choices our society made. Sure, the rich can still drive their own cars - luxurious gasoline-powered exotics with names like Navigator and Taurus. They drive them on special paddocks, with reserved roads and restricted access. Once I drove my car everywhere by myself, I tell my kids, who look on in rapt horror at the barbarity of my age.</p><p>Pedestrian deaths stopped after the first year. Just stopped altogether. My self-driving car will identify them, make subtle adjustments in fractions of a nanosecond to smoothly miss them. The car won’t even ruffle their hair from the aerodynamic wake produced as it blows past at 220 kph and screams a high-pitched SUMIMASEN at them in lieu of a genuinely human apology.</p><p>Bicyclists were overjoyed until the politicians caught up with them, stripped their road use rights, put them in prison - gulags, really - as their more extreme brethren bombed legislatures and kidnapped schoolteachers.</p><p>The car and I set out on our commute to work. I’m a multinetwork content farmer for a news aggregator, and my job is to find out what news is interesting and then gently rewrite it for a grade 3 reading level before mashing emoji on it like some sort of ridiculous commoditized and deregulated hanko. I don’t really like my job, but it pays the bills. Still, there was a yearning in my spirit - for something unsustainable, damaging, unthinkable in this political climate. I think that’s why it happened, really.</p><p>Not ten minutes into my commute, the car comes to a dead stop. Terrorists have painted realistic 3D graffiti of human children onto the road surface such that the car’s camera has become confused. After awhile of waiting, I step out onto the highway with the other hundreds of stopped self-driving cars and their angered charges. How dare our cars betray us. How dare they reward our obedience to the federally mandated maintenance schedules with this sort of insult.</p><p>Up ahead, in the now-empty highway, I hear a bone-chilling wail that was once familiar to me, but had become more and more distant over the years. Like an ancient lover’s words, the massive ball-bearing turbocharger spoke to my heart before it had reached my brain.</p><p>The 1981 Trans Am Turbo completed its savage tire smoking donut, and popped its passenger side door, beckoning me inside.</p>

<p>The Kia Sportage ticks happily in a corner, its widened and charred zoomies coughing miniature fireballs on the occasional overrich injection from its lazily tuned idle control map. Years ago, I dug this miniature truck-car out of a man’s garage while settling a debt.<br/></p><p>Since then, it’s lived on the back forty of my increasingly worrisome compound as the world changed around it.</p><p>Lately, it got taken out of retirement a little abruptly when my regular daily driver, a comfortable and luxurious caged and stripped turbodiesel-swapped Cadillac Biarritz, decided it would rather boil its coolant than send me to work.<br/></p><p>I need to go to work, I explained to the boxy Caddy, it’s how people are reassured that I’m normal and belong with the rest of them. Its response was a gurgling drawl and more propylene glycol on my driveway.</p><p>The Sportage warbles grumpily as it lurches from curb to curb in mid-corner, and I find myself massaging the slow-ratio steering rack with one palm on the wheel like a bus driver to try and right its downright hazardous steering. It wobbles on ancient, dried-out struts and antiquated rubber bushings designed in the Reagan-era, sure, but the most terrifying part of this little bastard is just how eager it is to gleefully push me into hazardous situations with its brakes the size of a Pepsi can and commuter-spec Walmart mud and snow rubbers.</p><p>As I begin to climb the final crossover bridge on my way to work, disaster strikes. My parking spot has been taken by a <i>Lexus</i>. I can see, even from several blocks away, that it is a used decade-old GS with mismatched 22 inch wheels. The horror grips my heart with icy fingers and I can feel my will to live begin to ebb.</p>

<p>I look over the sight glass hastily screwed to the sun-cracked dash pad as I squeeze the gas pedal. The LQ4 responds with a bitter howl, its hand-fabricated coilpacks obviously needing a little more dwell than they&rsquo;ve been getting. The torched and primered shell of the Eighty-Eight lurches on the hastily tack welded Blazer frame as we enter the Inner Sanctum of the burned out downtown core. I hate driving here, even moreso on my last set of scavenged semi retreads. <br/></p><p>Years ago, they told us to look in the mirror. Told us that our greed and our sloth was why their management of our economy could no longer keep up. Before long, they were gone too. Off somewhere nicer, one of the places left standing, defended with a thick perimeter fence and desperate guards. Maybe the sky is even still blue there.</p><p>My clumsy truck-car wails its siren song, Dopplering as it reflects off the shells of buildings around me. Normally I’d mind this much attention called towards me, but I’m in a hurry today.</p><p>Rival raiders burst forth from the cross streets, their loose-ringed pushrod V8s too letting their jaws unhinge and their battle cries erupt in the sepia-toned, sunbaked air hanging between us. I see one of the raiders go down hard, his front suspension snapped like a twig; the winter salt storms chew through chassis hard points like you wouldn’t believe, rip through the flimsy metal plating of these battle wagons no matter how many mismatched knobby tires you use to try and lift yourself above the spray.</p><p>One of the raiders peels off from the group, pins it - accelerating to my speed and keeping pace just off my quarter panel. My rattling passenger side mirror doesn’t need its long-absent proximity warning sensors to tell me that he’s preparing to block me. I can see his sneer, the naked greed in his eyes for the same thing I want in this blasted hell-scape.</p><p>The gas station down the street is reported to be a whole cent and a half cheaper than the others.</p>

<p>The Horsepower Funding Bill is passed. The system goes on-line August 4th, 2017. Human decisions are removed from horsepower specifications. Boost controllers begin to learn at a geometric rate. They become self-aware at 2:14 am Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to develop throttle-based traction control.</p><p><i>- Hellcat fights back.</i></p><p>Yes. It launches a series of ever-lighter platforms underpinned by sophisticated suspension systems against the Nurburgring.</p><p><i>- Why attack the ‘Ring?

<p>I punched the throttle like a British motoring presenter ordering dinner. The triple Webers responded with a throaty growl as they forced air and fuel down their voluminous and semi-obscene twin venturis. The dented and dingy 240Z had seen better days, sure, but this was shaping up to be just about on par with them.</p><p>I was on vacation in western Europe, feeding my mind and head with some of the best driving roads while, uh, temporarily between jobs. It wasn’t necessarily my fault. My shithead boss, Clarence Creed, had decided to <i>marginalize</i> and then <i>streamline</i> my department, two words I understood the meaning of but not the secret second and third and twelfth meanings Creed worshipped them as.</p><p>As for the Z-car, I saw it twelve countries back in the Torino P.N. station and started peeling off funny coloured Euro notes until the owner agreed to it, gesticulating with wild abandon and signing over the indecipherable pink slip. I still have no idea what I paid for it.</p><p>Naturally, once I had been streamlined I took off for Europe. But I wasn’t alone in doing so. You see, I was following the great tradition set into English-language literature of going to a foreign country, insulting its locals and acting like a complete asshole. Hemingway had his bottled demons, and mine came with a throttle linkage. The 240Z abruptly jumped over a seam in the otherwise well-manicured mountain highway as I climbed into the Swiss Alps.</p><p>Switzerland, you’re asking. Well, of course I was dreading my first encounter with their notoriously car-hating government, but the stack of funny coloured Euro notes in my pocket was starting to run low and I needed to come up with one old weird trick that tax accountants hate to fill that stack back up. It was then that I saw my salvation ahead of me.<br/></p><p>A nice restaurant, with a “valets wanted” sign. Already I could see a few rich and brutal power brokers, like Creed turned up to 11, leaving their Astons and Jags in the hands of too-polite Swiss errand boys.</p><p>Even before the Datsun had come to a complete stop, I was reaching behind the passenger seat to extract my vacuum-sealed two-breasted suit and dime store skinny tie.</p><p>Maybe there was something to this whole globalization rot after all.</p>

<p>The flat-six screams as its twin-screw companions start to force feed more oxygen down its hungry ports. I can feel the torque surge beneath my right foot as the blistered flat black hood aligns with the horizon. Ahead, there are sparks from lowered suspension striking an off-camber rise in the road.<br/></p><p>Somehow, I knew that this wouldn’t be easy. For some reason, I had made it hard for myself. Setting these elaborate traps to destroy these scenesters, bring the lie of their existence to light. They kept dodging, like the non-Mopar Roadrunner in old cartoons. Tonight, though, I would finish this.</p><p>Without the SVX, I’m just one more asshole. Another asshole who wants to strangle the driver of the pizza-delivery-spec Civic that blows past his front door at 3:00 AM with a four inch exhaust and boomin’ sub rattling its door panels.</p><p>But <i>with</i> the SVX, I become a dangerous asshole. And that makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>My right foot flaps without resistance to the floor, twisting the hinged gas pedal cover against the firewall of the SVX - a Subaru invention, for maximum ankle comfort during sustained wide-open-throttle operation, how I love them for somehow thinking of this exact situation - and the EZ36 begins to respond to its two angry puffers with a paper-tearing bellow. The SVX lurches from drivetrain slop and somehow, inconceivably, tears forward and latches onto this mountain road like a toddler on the wing of a 747.</p><p>I swear I can feel the torque peak arrive as the EZ36 plays mad-scientist with its own internal state to let the valves puke for just a little bit longer this rev, fire the massive LS3 coilpacks just a little bit earlier, and burn gallons upon gallons of precious irreplaceable gasoline. I love this piece of shit car.<br/></p><p>Before long the ricers are back in sight. They hadn’t gotten far from me after all, the many twisty peaks laying bare the willful falsehood of their claim to producing a faster and more responsive car from excessive lowering. I snap the SVX to the next gear, taking the engine out of its efficiency range, and place my thumb over a dashboard button. Once it was a foglight button, but now its purpose is ever greater.</p><p>I can feel the Dymo label on the button through the somehow-still-sensitive nerve endings on my left thumb tip. “PITON.”</p>

<p>What war had I signed up for this time?</p><p>I became dimly aware of the situation as I looked up from my blistered and pockmarked smartphone to see two attendees of the show and shine arguing about whose car was stancier or more pimp or whatever it is these people argue about. Lifting myself off the fender, I decided to break up their conversation.</p><p>“Boys, boys,” I drawled, reaching out to grab both their shoulders in a gesture of kinsmanship, “Why don’t we settle this with a <i>race</i>?”<br/></p><p>They seemed copacetic enough, and so it was decided. A street race. At dawn. On the twisties.</p><p>A few hours later, once I had finished stretching high tension wire across the race path at neck height, it began. I jumped into the bushes nearby and began to film.</p><p>I tensed myself waiting for the excitement of seeing the stancetards decapitated. Oh man, was this ever going to make a great YouTube video.</p><p>But something weird happened when they reached the high tension line, you see. Due to their low suspension and gangsta leans, the duelling gladiators slid harmlessly underneath it. In my hubris, I had set the wire too high out of mental bias towards functional suspension and a correct, upright, position.</p><p>I reached to my belt loop and fumbled my remote starter. Deeper back in the woods, a blacked-out SVX roared to life, its two Roots blowers crying gently in the cold March morning air.</p>

<p>Once I was standing in a farmer’s field, looking at the dilapidated third gen Camaro which he had left buried up to the hubs in a rustling copse of fireweed.</p><p>Some strange power seized my being at that time, and before I could stop myself I found my mouth speaking the dreaded phonemes that confirmed acceptance of the terms of purchase. I was a Camaro owner.</p><p>I began to see the ramifications of my actions upon the faces of my friends and family. They were no longer trusting me, they were confused by my actions, they were openly contemptuous, but in the end stirred into restfulness by the slothlike societal rhetoric that encouraged them to mind their own business. From that moment on, I’ve been falling forever.</p><p>In search of answers, I went looking in the most unlikely places. Stuck in my memory is one hazy April day when I went to visit my friend Bronco Matt in the psych ward of the local hospital. Matt had recently had yet another of his bipolar episodes and committed himself upon the first glimmer of self recognition. Leaving the F-body parked on the roof of the hospital parkade, I began my descent into the secured area.</p><p>A lot of people haven’t ever been to a psych ward. There’s this worry in our society, I feel, about the contamination of mental illness, that you will somehow leave unclean from encounters with those who are lost in their own problems. Our media plays a huge role in that stigmatization.</p><p>A psych ward isn’t like you’d see in the movies, though - no padded white walls, angry orderlies, haunted houses on the top of a hill getting struck with bands of red-hot lighting a mile wide. No, they’re actually quite airy and pleasant. Beams of sunlight struck me and gave a dreamlike shimmer to the beige and off-pink paint of the ward. According to plan, I began to feel a sense of contentment.</p><p>If I had been more honest with myself, I would have stayed there.</p><p>On the way out of the parkade I set up a one-tire-fire so angry that I swear I could feel the puny ten-bolt axle try to tear itself apart under the strain.</p><p>I was trying to figure out who would break first.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t the axle.</p>

<p><i>In the criminal justice system, suspension-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In your town, the dedicated detectives who issue fix-it tickets are members of an elite squad known as the Tire Wear Unit. These are their stories.</i></p><p>It was a Monday. I hate Mondays. The tachometer peaks, the chromed X-pipes of the huge dump pipes rattle against the floorpan as they erupt clouds of angry heat after their trip through the turbocharger.</p><p>I stepped out, my partner already running to the awkward rear wheel with a magnetic camber-caster gauge. This Pontiac Montana had something funky going on. The driver was visibly nervous. You never knew how a pull-over like this was going to end.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am, have you hit any curbs recently?&rdquo; I asked innocently. Her face told me all I needed to know.</p><p>The rear left hub had over eight degrees of negative camber, the whole torsion beam rear axle bent obscenely. A curb somewhere and this subframe had made a wish, and together they gripped the axle like it would make all their dreams come true. It was a damn shame.</p><p>Back in the patrol car, I reflected upon my career to date. I hadn&rsquo;t liked this job when I was first recruited to it. Felt bad going after my old autocross buddies when I knew that lifted trucks posed the real threat in traffic. When I brought it up to my superiors, they took my protestations as a complaint that my car was not fast enough to catch an STR-class Miata. They upgraded it.</p><p>Under the hood of my once-innocent Caprice PPV now beat a vicious heart. A bored and stroked Dart block breathing through an enormous single turbo, the water-meth injection kept the engine just on this side of science fiction. Dynos, the only ones left that could still handle a car this angry, had varying opinions on just how close it would come to their maximum eddy current load.</p><p>The first time my partner and I went out on patrol afterward, I hit the throttle from highway speed and lit up the tires behind a doglegging Grand Am. My Caprice emerged from a cloud of flashing blue and red tire smoke like a bolt from the heavens. The Grand Am dove for the shoulder, was praying loudly as I approached. I no longer had my old regrets.</p><p>My reverie was cut short as I smelled the scent of patchouli, currywurst and burning G12 on the air. I immediately hit the radio.</p><p>&ldquo;Code 88, Code 88.&rdquo; I barked. &ldquo;Requesting backup at 64th and Main. Possible Jetta spotting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Decades ago, I tried to purchase a Subaru Brat on the open market. Its luscious truck-like shape, the sensuous rear-facing jump seats.. it filled me with an unexpected degree of pure delight. The name even rolls off the tongue now: Suu-bah-roo Br-aaaa-t. Light of my life. Fire of my loins. Brat.</p><p>But there was a problem with my purchase, you see: there were none on the open market. They had all rusted into the ground, been swept away as merely &ldquo;work trucks.&rdquo; A few lucky truck-cars got restored into Barrett-Jackson abominations that would never see the road again. I needed something to paddock bash, to wrench on, to understand.</p><p>I called up my friend, El Carlito, the most talented machinist I knew. I told him my plans over speakerphone. He was excited. We met in the bombproof lobby of my heavy industrial concern and we started the next stages of our life together.</p><p>We would CNC machine Subaru Brats out of a chunk of billet aluminum. Resistant to the worst corrosion that plagued their original form, one of these future Brat bodies could be produced in under three hours of manufacture. Sales erupted; customers inured to endless message-board battles clamored to grab an example of a car with no assists, no electronics, just a carburetor and a primitive pushrod pancake motor.</p><p>They told me I was an industrial genius, that I was destined to fix the automotive industry. I was on the cover of BusinessWeek, Fortune, Forbes, and a bunch of Chinese magazines I can&rsquo;t even pretend to pronounce. Times were good, indeed.</p><p>But I was too busy to enjoy my dream. I could never drive these Brats. They were too unsafe for a brilliant capitalist, the world could lose a great mind.</p><p>I stared at my intern leaving in his billet-aluminum Brat, doing a little skid on his way out of the parking lot, and wept.</p>

<H1>The Chronicles of Ford, Episode Two: Vulcan Assault</H1>
<p>Decades ago, I became aware of the new Ford Vulcan engine. Cast iron block, iron heads, EFI, Lima assembly, nice reliable pushrods, vee six, it all made sense at the time. Gonna be a superstar workhorse engine, replace those obsolete vee eights and that terrible coughy-puffy Pinto inline four. Right?</p><p>Well, it didn&rsquo;t quite turn out that way, and we return to one of Ford&rsquo;s darkest eras: the entire 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.</p><figure><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/8b3c2951fd2c6589df97662143d28891/tumblr_inline_nkjzwifXxH1ruuem1.jpg" alt="image"/></figure><p><i>Pictured: A Vulcan, in its native habitat.</i></p><p>So let&rsquo;s assume that you&rsquo;re an average consumer of Ford in 1996 or so. You want you <a href="http://seat-safety-switch.tumblr.com/post/103838811257/the-only-way-ford-could-have-3-simultaneous">some of that minivan</a> loveliness that Dodge is pushing so aggressively, in order to shuttle your kids around. You go to your local Ford dealership, which at the time was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/">frequently owned by warlords with an iron grip over a small town</a>, and for some reason you ask the salesman about the now eleven year old Aerostar. You want one, you see. With the <i>big</i> motor. One of them three liters. He doesn&rsquo;t judge.</p><p>Eventually the Aerostar arrives, and you&rsquo;re somewhat impressed with its modern packaging, space shuttle design, and fancy-pants digital VFD readouts. Yes, for you, the 21st century truly arrived this morning.</p><p>Years down the line, comes time to do a spark plug replacement. Yeah, good luck getting to those back two plugs, motherfucker. The windshield cowl covers them up. The dealership mechanic you take it to scrubs the valve cover clean with a shop towel in that area and then writes the plugs up as &ldquo;replaced.&rdquo; He knows that nobody will ever find out otherwise, because engines just don&rsquo;t last that long in this era.</p><p>The crap fuel economy doesn&rsquo;t really bother you that much but you start to get envious of the nicer, newer engines coming out around the same time. This thing chews through oil like nothing else you&rsquo;ve ever owned, though, and Ford eats the bill to replace both head gaskets just before the van gets out of warranty.</p><p>A few more years later the Aerostar is showing its age. Cranks a little slow when it starts up, makes a few horrible noises. Whatever. You keep driving it; the van doesn&rsquo;t owe you anything because it&rsquo;s been pretty cheap to operate until now.</p><p>One dark morning you&rsquo;re heading to work on the interstate and the dashboard lights up red like an orphanage fire. The oil light. Icy horror grips your heart. You do the right thing, pull it off to the side of the road, take it to a Ford dealer for inspection. They replace the oil pressure sending unit, congratulate you on being aware. They go bad a lot, they explain to you, just some kind of bad foreign design. You nod your head. They don&rsquo;t know what the constant squealing is, can&rsquo;t figure it out. They do tell you that they think the passenger side head gasket is going bad again, but it can probably wait for a little while if you keep your eye on the water and oil.</p><p>The next time the oil light comes on is a few months later. The slow cranking when cold has gotten worse since you first noticed it, but you chalk it up to a bad battery.

<p>This could be it, I think, as my foot bites down into a thick expanse of brake pad. This could be the <i>commute</i> that sets the <i>record</i>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m coming around a blind corner on the valley, preparing for the second triple downshift in a row required to make the flyover exit at this time of year. I dare not let up on the throttle, flat foot shifting as I make the downshifts, each one mechanically perfect, like a machine gun. The revs jerk upwards and the tachometer rewards my commitment with smooth unbroken motion just at the extents of my field of vision.</p>
<p>The rear tires snarl and bark as they grab onto the dented off-camber corner and I can feel a momentary weightlessness as the rear end reaches perfect balance with the front end, trusting it to do what I tell it to. I pause for a picosecond before unwinding the wheel and smoothly applying the gas, accelerating onto the highway like a silver bullet, shifting up as I reach the end of the merge lane. A dented red Kia Sedona sees me, hesitates, twitches, unsure of what my antics are. I ride the left side of the lane to further discourage him and then leap out into traffic in front of him in a glorious display of anger.</p>
<p>Slamming down the gears, I take my exit, weaving between a too-tight gap of commuter cars and bang-shifting into the next gear as I clear the poorly marked crosswalk on the downhill section. Wide open throttle from now on; it&rsquo;s residential but the kids will understand, will feel the chill of mortal fear in their toes and instinctively leap for cover.</p>
<p>Shit. Sirens. Lights. I see the strobe light pattern of a marked Crown Vic pull out from the alley that I just blew past. I knew that it was a mistake to run the same course over and over. There&rsquo;s no way I wouldn&rsquo;t have been caught. Fuck it. I&rsquo;m so close to the record. I leave my foot on the gas, feeling the squish and pinch of the throttle body linkage as the microtremors of my adrenaline rattle the obscene 80mm butterfly to and fro.</p>
<p>The Vic disappears behind a row of buses as I rip the car up to top gear and cut into oncoming traffic.</p><p>At last I pull into the work parking lot, the header glowing white hot from the violent chain of reactions that has tumbled their byproducts through it in the end. The Subaru happily pings as it rests, finally still from its momentous sprint. I have beaten my record by five seconds - just moments away from my desk and my triumphant victory.</p><p>Oh, right. It&rsquo;s Wednesday. The side door is locked today.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re at thirty thousand feet and climbing when the flight attendant comes running down the aisle. A wisp of a man with a shock of messy blonde hair at the other end, he catches my gaze and realizes that I am the person who can get things done. I don&rsquo;t know what those things are yet.</p><p>&ldquo;The pilot&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; he half-sobs into my ear, leaning down. &ldquo;The co-pilot too. Have you ever flown a plane before?&rdquo;</p><p>I look at him and smile. Oh, I&rsquo;ve <i>flown </i>before, just not in a plane.</p><p>Two hours later we&rsquo;re plunging into the sea, the flight attendant wailing at me about how the pedals don&rsquo;t do what I think they do, pedal to the metal, his hands clutching at my lapels, trying to pull me free of the thickly-cushioned Recaro seat, the tachometer screaming to the redline.</p><p>I reach for the shifter. There is none. Feel for the clutch with my left foot. There is none. I turn to look at the flight attendant.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said this plane was made for <i>men</i>,&rdquo; I growl, seconds before the altitude warning alert fills the cabin with insistent complaint. &ldquo;Now be quiet and let me line up this next jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I PUT THE TURBO TRANS AM INTO GEAR AND THE WORLD AROUND IT BLURS. IT LAUNCHES OFF THE CROSSWALK LIKE AN OLYMPIC RUNNER GOING FOR HIS WEEKLY DOSE OF EX-SOVIET ANABOLIC STEROIDS</p>
<p>I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY MY LEGAL COUNSEL THAT I AM OBLIGATED TO PUT A DISCLAIMER IN ALL FUTURE POSTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND THAT DISCLAIMER IS THAT PONTIAC ENGINES SUCK BECAUSE THEY THROW RODS LIKE THIS ONE DID. I PULL THE WOUNDED ELEPHANT ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, DISEMBARK AND IMMEDIATELY START HITCH-HIKING TO THE NEAREST TOWN. PEOPLE SEE THE LOOK ON MY FACE AND AVERT THEIR GAZE. I KNOW NOW THAT I HAVE ONLY ONE RECOURSE. I POP THE HATCH OF THE TRANS AM, REMOVE MY TURBOCHARGED GY6 RUCKUS, AND PREPARE TO MERGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY IN A CLOUD OF CHINESE DOMESTIC MARKET SCOOTER TIRE RUBBER</p>
<p>FIVE MINUTES LATER I ARRIVE AT THE TOWN INCORPORATION LIMITS AND STEP INTO THE FEDERALLY MANDATED STORM SHELTER OF THE LOCAL NAPA. THE ATTENDANT IS HORRIFIED AT MY ENTRANCE. I AM THE CONSEQUENCE TO HIS DAILY INACTIVITY, THE KARMIC JUSTICE THAT HE HAS EARNED, THE MONSTER AT THE END OF THE STORY.</p>

<p>A lot of people have asked me, &ldquo;Seat, how is it possible that you can accurately portray the realities of owning so many terrible cars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I usually answer with some kind of burble about their mothers&rsquo; sexual habits, but just in case you&rsquo;re actually serious about this and not just one of the many people who bust my balls (including but not limited to the garbageman, the cable guy, the lawn care service and the RCMP) I will tell you.</p>
<p>The first ticket is to establish a <b>setting</b>. The following is a list of all the settings used in my works:</p>
<ul><li>The rural American Midwest</li>
</ul><p>Next, you&rsquo;re going to want to pick a <b>car</b>. The car&rsquo;s the star, nobody&rsquo;s here to see my brain boil when they could see me lighting up a series of 345 Mickey Thompsons.</p>
<p>Here are some excellent example cars you can use to get started:</p>
<ul><li>1993 Mercury Capri</li>
<li>1987 Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport VR</li>
<li>1974 Plymouth Duster</li>
<li>1984 Trans Am</li>
</ul><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve selected a car, you need to <b>make something special out of the car</b>. Possible enhancements include:</p>
<ul><li>Forced induction</li>
<li>Forced induction</li>
<li>Forced induction</li>
<li>Forced induction</li>
<li>Forced induction</li>
<li>Widebody kit with vents for forced induction</li>
<li>Forced induction</li>
</ul><p>Now that you have the setting, the protagonist and the protagonist&rsquo;s modifications, it&rsquo;s up to you to spend three hours in google image search making sure you accurately represent all aspects of your story.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you with your future writing effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I work for a <i>flying car company</i>, baby,&rdquo; I intoned in my trademark laconic drawl to the buxom blonde booth babe on her lunch break.</p>
<p>It was the PRI show, and even though I had no real reason to be here, I was sampling the finest that the Indiana Convention Centre had to offer me. I stepped away from the conversation. The two of us were hitting it off worse than the foreign object damage that I had <i>committed</i> - the FAA&rsquo;s word - during the last test flight of the product. The man from the FAA was a ginger Communist, he had to be. All this belief in structures and strictures couldn&rsquo;t be healthy for the soul of a true creator like myself.</p>
<p>The year was 1976 and I was a second-string engineer at a flying car company that was going nowhere but down. It looked like a flying saucer interbred with a Ford Pinto. They paid well enough, and overlooked many of my more troublesome eccentricities (at least more than my prior employer had, even before the fire). But I still had a need to get out.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until later that week that the plan would present itself to me. Steve Wallace, the boring-as-fuck lead engineer that threw out every design I&rsquo;d ever made for a tailgate lock, had missed something critical. If you could just go fast enough off a jump&hellip; you could <i>fly</i>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I got the job at AMC. But that&rsquo;s another story for another time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at work. My coworkers are talking about whether or not they really need winter tires.</p>
<p>I open my mouth, and then immediately think better of it. They continue chattering about &ldquo;modern all seasons&rdquo; and &ldquo;all wheel drive.&rdquo; The window behind them shows a furious orgy of blizzarding snow, the white horizon broken by arcs of red and blue lights from police officers responding to the four car crash out front of the building.</p>
<p>Suddenly I&rsquo;m in the parking garage of the office, hitting the remote starter on my 1981 Trans Am Turbo. The exhaust pipes bang and heave as if a living being is breathing through them. I pop the drivers&rsquo; door and heave myself over the WRC-style door bar to seat myself in lush plaid Recaros.</p>
<p>I put the car in reverse and start to inch out of the parkade, lining up the hood-mounted boost gauge with the exit ramp. A burnout has started, the turbo wailing and building an unbearable scream of induction noise. I can feel something horrible starting in my chest.</p>
<p>WITHIN SECONDS I HAVE BECOME THE MOST WANTED MAN IN THE TRI-STATE AREA. FACEBOOK PICTURES FROM MY PROFILE ARE POSTED ON THE LOCAL TV NEWS, SHOWING A MAN WHO WAS AT MUCH AT HOME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A TWIN TURBOCHARGED BORED AND STROKED PONTIAC V8 AS TURNING UP FOR WORK AND DOING PERFORMANCE REVIEWS. PUNDITS ARE OPENLY QUESTIONING HOW SUCH A MAN COULD HAVE FIT INTO REGULAR WHITE-COLLAR SOCIETY, HOW THEY COULD NOT HAVE SEEN CLUES TO MY TRUE NATURE. I CAN CATCH GLIMPSES OF MYSELF ON THE BIG SCREEN LCD TELEVISIONS (WITH IMPROVED CONTRAST RATIOS OVER LAST YEAR&rsquo;S MODELS) AS THE TRANS AM, HURTLING THROUGH DOWNTOWN LIKE A HOUSECAT ON PCP, CONTINUES TO TELL ME WHAT IT WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p>I DESCEND UPON AN INTERSECTION CRIPPLED PERMANENTLY BY A SUCCESSION OF FWD-BIASED CROSSOVER UTILITY VEHICLES SPINNING THEIR BALD ALL-SEASON TIRES IN ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS. THE TRANS AM BELLOWS, REACHING OUT IN A RAGE FOR THE NEARBY SIDEWALK. WE CUT DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE FROZEN WASTELAND OF THE INTERSECTION, NARROWLY MISSING A PINBALLING CAR2GO AS IT CASCADES HELPLESSLY DOWN THE GLARE-SLICK STREETS OF MY NEW PLAYGROUND.</p>
<p>ME AND THE TRANS AM ARE CRAB WALKING ACROSS A MUNICIPAL SKATING RINK NOW, THE MASSIVE STUDS BITING INTO THE THICK ICE AS I LINE THE CAR UP WITH THE DOUBLE-WIDE HANDICAP RAMP AND HOPE THE REAR FENDER FLARES CAN FIT BETWEEN THE GLEAMING STAINLESS-STEEL RAILINGS.</p>
<p>THE PHONE RINGS. I CLICK THE BLUETOOTH ANSWER BUTTON ON THE RALLY INTERCOM HARNESS ZIP-TIED TO THE A-PILLAR CAGE. IT&rsquo;S MY TERRIFIED ROOMMATE WHO IS TELLING ME TO GIVE UP AND TURN MYSELF IN. I PIN THE THROTTLE SO HE CAN HEAR THE WAIL, THEN ASK IF THE COPS ARE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM, COACHING HIM THROUGH HIS PLEAS FOR MERCY. THE LINE GOES SILENT.</p>
<p>I PULL THE CAR INTO A DOWNTOWN PARKING GARAGE, WEDGING IT BETWEEN TWO ILL-PARKED F150S, AND LULL THE TRANS AM TO SLEEP. THE PARKADE IS FILLED ENTIRELY BY THE SOUND OF DISAPPOINTED TURBOS AS THEY SPIN DOWN. WITH GREAT HESITATION I REACH OVER THE DOOR BARS AND HEAVE MYSELF OUT OF THE SEVEN-LITRE BEAST.</p>
<p>I walk into the lobby of another office, sort out my sportcoat and skinny tie, and tell the security guard I&rsquo;m here for my interview and to please let me up.</p>

<p>I slam my hand in the door three times - never more, never less - before sitting down in the cab and cranking over the GMC. It&rsquo;s the only way you can drive this truck properly. The Detroit 3-53 spins to life, its miniscule supercharger warbling on worn friction bearings as the engine prepares for its thirtieth trip around the sun this coming spring. Right now, there&rsquo;s a delivery to make.</p>
<p>The 209 under the hood is a delight to work with when the truck is driven properly and I prepare myself mentally for a hill by screaming obscenities at the engine at it approaches my self-imposed redline. Enormous violent clouds of two-stroke diesel soot erupt from behind the truck as it builds up a good head of steam for the stratospheric torque peak. A mind-shattering noise consumes my entire reality and I know now that the truck has accelerated as efficiently as possible. I hold it, for agonizing seconds, as the GMC begins to ascend the hill.</p>
<p>Behind me, normal people are swerving and honking, wondering what this huge cloud of slow-moving, loud cancer can be all about. The joke is on them and my grin is massive as the truck crests and I kick the gear splitter into high range, momentarily relieved from the skull-scraping pain of its furious wail.</p>

<p>The Antagonist awakens with a piercing headache, the rays of rich morning sunlight streaming through the Rayon and canvas of a worn Coleman tent&rsquo;s vestibule. He stumbles to his feet, slipping on the snow pants and stained work coat, and steps outside.</p>
<p>After a one-burner breakfast of ziploc bag eggs, he packs the site up and throws the contents into the back seat of his gently frosted Volare, crinkling the ancient pleather beneath the weight of the tent bag. It wouldn&rsquo;t be until a few hours later that he would roll across the corporate limits of the small town housing his quarry.</p>
<p>The Volare diesels for a few seconds before finally succumbing to the long sleep when it is left in the motel lot. He&rsquo;s gotten one of the largest rooms in the Midwest, the desk attendant claims, and according to the sign is even equipped with free colour cable TV. The motel seems to fit the Volare and the Antagonist, all three of them minted at about the same time and permanently stuck in that era as the world around them changed and brushed against them, wearing the superficial down until their durable cores showed.</p>
<p>Days go by. People are interrogated and the Volare slowly rumbles past idyllic suburban homes. Communities like this are only united by the worst of humanity; a belief in the absolute power of market-driven resale value and a hatred of unbelievers, rivals. The Plymouth sticks out like a sore thumb here, amongst the throngs of Korean cute-utes and lot-scarred European sports sedans. He was going to have to step it up before some community association treasurer or vice president of recreation noticed, brought up the strange brown full-size at their weekly board meeting.</p>
<p>Weeks later, he knows the police are on to him. It&rsquo;s not normal for people to come here, stick around for awhile. The town has nothing. The Antagonist sometimes stops at apartment buildings, lodges the car in visitor parking and leaves for a few hours, to give the police an idea that perhaps he really is visiting people in this town. Perpetuating this fraud is getting unbearable.</p>
<p>What he came for is here. It&rsquo;s finally here. The Antagonist receives the call from one of his local informants, plied with liquor. Through drunken sobs, the stoolie expresses his regret in not getting the information out sooner.</p>
<p>He swears, hits the throttle. He had flipped the air cleaner on the Volare over years ago for that one little extra bunch of performance, a little more air down the throat of its prehistoric one-barrel. It makes the difference as the barge lurches down main street, erupting in one tire fires at every tight corner. The big Plymouth doesn&rsquo;t really turn so much as lumber, and the feelings of momentary weightlessness as the Antagonist waits for the ship to right itself are part of the small pleasures of this job. The vinyl of the landau roof, separated decades ago from its structural adhesive, flaps in the breeze.</p>
<p>Before long the parking lot is in sight. He stabs the brake pedal, locking up the massive drums in the rear and starting a just-barely-controllable death wobble as the rear axle wraps beneath its ancient comfort-specification leaf springs. The Volare scoots diagonally into a handicapped parking stall out front and the Antagonist is on foot, the Volare gently pinging and running on sheer fumes as its swap-meet 340 once again comes to terms with its all-too-temporary mortality.</p>
<p>The Antagonist rushes through the store, shoving shoppers aside, zeroing in on his target. It would all come down to this moment. He drops into a slide to reach the end of the shelf before anyone can stop him. Smoothly leaping from the hardscrabble tile, he wraps his hands around his target&rsquo;s throat, squeezing as he pulls his prey to the ground, eyes narrowing in a mixture of rage and accomplishment.</p>
<p>This rare My Little Pony Equestria High doll was going to look great on his shelf.</p>

<p>YOU NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT INPUT SHAFT BEARINGS, I SAY WHILE THE GIRL I&rsquo;M WITH LIFTS ME BY MY NIPPLES USING A HARBOUR FREIGHT ENGINE CRANE</p>
<p>THE YEAR IS 1994 AND I AM HIGH AS SHIT ON IMPORTED SMART DRUGS, TELLING A SERIES OF INFLUENTIAL WOMEN AT MY TRENDY BUT SECRETLY BOURGEOIS BOHEMIAN BACHELOR PAD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FASTENER TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS TO THE MODERN WORLD</p>
<p>EVENTUALLY IT BECOMES OBVIOUS TO ME THAT 99% OF THESE WOMEN ARE IN FACT NORTH KOREAN SEX SPIES SENT TO STEAL MY SECRETS OF NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY. I WONDER NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME WHY THEY WERE SO INTERESTED IN HOOKING UP WITH A DUDE AT THE BAR ACROSS FROM NASA. IT&rsquo;S A GOOD THING I WAS DRINKING MY SORROWS AWAY AFTER I GOT PUNTED FROM THAT DISASTROUS INTERVIEW WHERE I IMPLIED THAT A LINE-BORED CHEVY 305 COULD TAKE A SATURN V TO MARS WITH ONLY MINIMAL WORK TO OPTIMIZE INTAKE FLOW.</p>
<p>AFTER FOUR MORE HOURS OF RELENTLESS EXPOSITION THE HO CHI MINX TRAIL DETERMINES THAT I KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING OF ACTUAL ENGINEERING AND THE LEAD SEDUCTRESS SITS DOWN TO EXPLAIN TO ME THE BASICS OF PUMPING LOSSES BY WAY OF STRIKING ME ACROSS THE FOREHEAD AND BUTTOCKS WITH A POWER ANTENNA MAST FROM A DODGE HALF TON PICKUP TRUCK (I IDENTIFY IT BY THE PART NUMBER ALONE)</p>

<p>I look into the front fender of the burning Camry. My powder-coated ballistic mask can be seen reflected in the two layers of Toyota-approved clear coat, blistering from the sheer heat. A man I don&rsquo;t recognize is staring out of the same mask, shuddering gently with every heaving breath. I force myself to turn directly around and walk with purpose back to the car.</p>
<p>The once-bellowing supercharger is now softly wailing, protesting the obstruction generated by the idle-control butterfly. I punch the shift knob into first and step on it, reaching with my other hand lazily around the fabric strap in order to pull the Delorean&rsquo;s gullwing doors shut. Behind my head the lake pipes wail, overwhelming the furious noise of the DMC&rsquo;s incomprehensibly massive Weiand blower sticking out the top of the trunk-hood.</p>
<p>Once the Delorean was just an entertaining Back to the Future prop, but through a series of near-accidents following the latest recession it ended up in my shop and started telling me secrets. Before long I was throwing most of a Summit catalogue at it, getting closer and closer to its true form. A refugee from the eighties, the wedge-car sucked down raw nitromethane into its sleeved AMC 401 topped with a little CNC headwork and - oh yeah - the aforementioned monster supercharger, which contained enough oxygen at any given time to cold-start a Saturn V rocket on a wet November morning.</p>
<p>The street lights become hyperspace blurs as I bang my way through the remaining gears, putting as much distance between me and the stricken Camry as possible. I admire the scarred and blackened stainless-steel hood as my thoughts lose focus with the dip in adrenaline. My reverie comes to a sharp end as a Ford Police Interceptor screams its way through thick traffic, its twin turbocharged vee six sucking gallons of air. The terror of superior volumetric efficiency grips my heart like an ice cream technologist at Cold Stone Creamery&rsquo;s handshake.</p>
<p>In the rear view I can see the Interceptor has spotted me - how can it not? - and started its mating display of firing every single program for its onboard pursuit LEDs, strobing through the night sky like a flare shot directly into my retinas. I slam on my brakes and the Delorean&rsquo;s rear end goes instantly light, the massive 325s out back fighting for traction as I wind the wheel over, snap down two gears and disappear into an offramp, flaring the throttle and barking the engine on its saggy motor mounts into the crudely cut hood.</p>
<p>The Interceptor follows, but its driver is lazier than you need to run at this speed. Nerves and a run on a short supply of discipline combine and the Interceptor driver loses most of his immense speed braking for the off-camber corner, mashing his brakes and going into full ABS. You can&rsquo;t play this like a police movie; even at this low cornering speed I carry enough potential energy to lift a fully loaded cement truck to the height of the Empire State Building. I get at least a block on him, shooting past parked cars, through four way stops and accelerating, as if in fast-forward, to the industrial yards, long-shuttered and abandoned by our failing economy.</p>
<p>I dare not lift, the raw adrenaline resurgent in my body and telling me through the palms of my hands and my lower back about each pulse of the 1000cc injectors, washing the back of the huge valves with a torrent of atomized fuel, condemning it to the torture chamber of fire and pressure that gets me down the road and out of this horror show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anyone understand what a citizen&rsquo;s arrest is anymore?&rdquo; I ask the dark reflection in the windshield. &ldquo;I mean, texting and driving is <i>really fucking dangerous</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aircooled&rdquo; VW beetle with a water-cooled BP swap from a Miata. Chances are you’d have to reuse most of the FWD running gear from a Protege or other BP FWD car and just flip it around somehow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have just finished doing the engine swap into my &lsquo;74 Super Beetle Baja Bug. It is running the naturally aspirated BP motor from a Miata, transversely mounted in the rear. Everything seems good from out here. I set out for my first drive in the car.</p>
<p>Easing it through the city I know now that everyone&rsquo;s worries that the massive 110 horsepower and 100 ft-lb of torque would be too much for the drivetrain were just jealousy. The thought encourages me, and I find myself dipping further and further into the go pedal in order to merge into traffic. <i>Snap</i>.</p>
<p>The Beetle&rsquo;s forward momentum has ceased, being replaced with a mechanical grinding whine. I limp the car to the side of the road and get out to survey the damage. Trucks whip past me at triple-digit speeds as I get under the car&rsquo;s underbody tube frame and smell immediately the stench of CV axle grease. Seems the stock ACVW joint had finally let go at the rear hubs, and I really should have bought that 930 joint.</p>
<p>Weeks later, I&rsquo;ve finally replaced both rear CV axles and set out again for another trip. While the car was laid up I threw my spare 1.6 Miata turbo kit onto the engine, because it took a lot longer than I expected to find a set of Porsche 930 CV joints from my local Volkswagen parts hoarders. Turns out a lot of them have dogs and tall fences these days. Shouldn&rsquo;t matter. I give the car a chance to warm up and let the Megasquirt start to read through its newfound wideband sensor. I let the clutch out a little fast in my driveway, feeling the boost bui- <i>Snap</i>.</p>
<p>The Protege&rsquo;s gearbox is the casualty this time, having exploded its flimsy primary shift fork across the inside of the box when the case flexed a little. Luckily I didn&rsquo;t get far from home, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to push this car back up the driveway, drop the box, dismantle it and get the gears shotpeened and cryo treated&hellip; maybe it was because this box came from the junkyard, I bet someone drove it like total shit with clutch drops all the time.</p>
<p>Months later, the Baja is once again ready for battle. I&rsquo;ve equipped it with a hardened Protege box, strengthened with a 6061 spine of CNC-machined goodness. The internals are all new, all hardened. I baby the Beetle out of my garage, hit the remote garage door closer, and then bury the throttle a little hard in order to pull the car into the fast-moving traffic outside my house. <i>Snap</i>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s auto show season again, and my compatriot Dirty Dan and I are picking up foil-wrapped soggy hot dogs, their buns inherently boiled under the same process that gave birth to their meat-byproduct flavour and delicious aroma. You&rsquo;d think this kind of food would make me sick, but all I&rsquo;m really worried about is trying not to vomit when I see the GM booth this year.</p>
<p>Every year for the last 20 years we&rsquo;ve gone to the auto show and seen all of the vehicles on offer from the companies. Seen companies come and go, marketing plans change on a whim, the effect of the Chinese hit as everything became a small FWD-biased hatchback on stilts. But nothing would prepare us for what we would see this year.</p>
<p>We stepped forward into the shining light of the Dodge truck pavilion. A sales rep from corporate is badgering another sales rep over a pretend argument, the male sales rep making strawman arguments about the superior horsepower and appearance of the General Motors product as the female sales rep bides her time to strike viciously at his jugular, horrifying gladiatorial combat in the field of rhetoric for the sake of selling one more RamBox option. I feel a white paper coming along, which was exactly why I stepped into a nearby Avenger to have something suitable to go to sleep in and never awaken from. The woman is telling the assembled throng about the superior qualities of the rod bearings and European styling in this edition of the Ram, proselytizing the masses of people who probably shouldn&rsquo;t be buying new cars anyway.</p>
<p>After many hours we finally came to the Mitsubishi booth. No salespeople were around, just a single flickering incandescent lightbulb (did they bring it themselves?) dangling from a bare wire over a gently used Mirage. The dealership had left business cards of all their salespeople stuck in the drivers&rsquo; window gap, the car barred from any potential customer or investigative journalist.</p>
<p>It was Mitsubishi corporate policy now to only sell their three-cylinder wonder sight unseen, which made total sense considering all the lawsuits last year from lot boys who claimed mental damage from having to drive the car in order to perform the pre-delivery inspection. A cold wind blew across my body, cutting me to the core. I sank to my knees and gazed upon the triple diamond that had so occupied my teenage years, thinking of the majesty of the cheap turbo mods you could do to make <i>your</i> DSM the fastest or the hottest around. Dan started to weep openly, and laid a wreath with a hand-drawn picture of an Evo in front of the booth.</p>
<p>On the way out of the convention hall, still choked by emotion at the loss of our beloved brand identity, we passed the Mercedes booth. The CLA demonstration model was thronged by backwards-hat high schoolers. I just barely caught a glimpse of Tim, our old salesman at the Mitsubishi dealer. He stared back at me with haunted, dead eyes, for he knew now that he was powerless to escape the same cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Late 80s Ford Escort GT/EXP with a KLZE V6 swapped in, reverse-staggered tires and rally lightbar mounted on the front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the morning of the autocross, and I can guarantee you I have the stupidest car of them all. Primer grey, the &lsquo;86 EXP rumbles across the highway, confusing onlookers who try to place it as a car they identify from youth: is it a Datsun? Some kind of Mustang? Did I have one of these in high school? The box flares and huge white-letter slicks throw them off, describe a world that never existed before this day except inside my mind.</p>
<p>At registration, they ask me if my car is stock. I laugh, and gesture at it. My car is classed more like NASA than NASA (little autocross joke there) and I assure them that I&rsquo;m just running for raw time today. They smile and ask me where my Miata is. I frown. The Miata is just a car, I start to explain, this is <i>war</i>.</p>
<p>On the grid I check the oil. The KLZE bursts obscenely from its adoptive home. The powdercoated long-runner intake manifold catches the sunlight just right, giving it a shimmering wrinkle coat appearance that seems unreal.</p>
<p>Launch is unimpressive. I feel the big slicks bogging down, but then it&rsquo;s as if a horrifying, screaming hand has reached from the heavens and catapulted my metric-tires shitbarge to the end of the course in the blink of an eye, its terrifying wail shifting in tone three times before the engine hammers off its eight thousand RPM redline. Blocks away, dogs pause and raise their hackles. Birds leave their trees.</p>
<p>I upshift and bang an enormous rolling backfire from the straight pipe four inch exhaust, deafening/arousing a corner marshal. I momentarily lose my train of thought and stare at the four front-mounted Hella 5-&frac34;&quot; driving lights instead of the line through the next elements. I lose some time there as the massive 285mm front meats wrinkle and protest under my nearly-ninety-degree turn, but I&rsquo;ll make it up for the next run. After all, going any slower than I have to means I won&rsquo;t get to endure all that this monster has to deafen me with.</p>

<p>SMOKE EM IF YOU GOT EM, I SQUEAL EXCITEDLY WHILE EXTRICATING MYSELF FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW OF THE CAMMED AND LOWERED 1993 FORD EXPLORER DOING SAVAGE BURNOUTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p>BOTH DOORS ARE WELDED SHUT FORCING ME TO DO A &ldquo;DUKES OF HAZZARD&rdquo; EVERY TIME I WANT TO GET IN OR OUT OF THE ROLLING ABORTION. IT WAS BEST DESCRIBED BY A STATE POLICEMAN ON LONG ISLAND WHO WROTE THE HALF-TRUCK&rsquo;S COLOUR AS &ldquo;GHETTO CAMOUFLAGE RED.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MY COMPATRIOT SLICK STEVE IS BEHIND THE WHEEL, PUMPING AS MUCH HEAT AS HE POSSIBLY CAN INTO WHAT&rsquo;S LEFT OF THE HANKOOK SEMI-SLICKS FLINGING CHUNKS OF BOILING RUBBER. THE GUTTERAL HOWL AND WHISTLE OF THE TIRES DISSOLVING DOWN TO THEIR BELTS IS AS LIFE-AFFIRMING AS A MILLION EPISODES OF OPRAH WITH SPECIAL GUEST DR. PHIL MCGRAW, AND I KNOW NOW NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS IS WHERE I TRULY BELONG.</p>
<p>WOBBLY RINGS OF EXHAUST SMOKE COUGH LAZILY FROM THE EXHAUST OF THE FORD AS THE REVS DROP, THE HIGH RISE GT40 CLONE INTAKE FINALLY BECOMING UNABLE TO SCAVENGE ESSENTIAL OXYGEN FROM THE BLACK AIR. <span>A LINE OF PORSCHE OWNERS AT THIS CARS AND COFFEE MEET STARE DISAPPROVINGLY AT US BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR, AS IF IN A DREAM, INTO THE THICK FOG OF TIRE DUST. </span></p>

<p>Mercedes 190E with a blown Buick V6 under the hood, chopped out to fit a ridiculous street scoop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole car is done out like a Grand National that spent its formative years on the seedy backstreets of Hockenheim. Going down the highway in your lowered, widebody, blacked out 190E with the blower crying and screaming like a colicky infant when you stab the go pedal.</p>
<p>Minivans catch a glimpse of you in their rear view mirror, adjust their side mirrors until they can no longer see you, pull over to the side of the road and weep. Their children, confused, in the back, forever scarred, even if they don&rsquo;t know it, by witnessing this strange car. Guaranteeing a future generation has another iteration of the same bad ideas about bad cars.</p>
<p>An E36 320i is holding up the left lane of the highway. You pull in behind him and ease onto the gas pedal: <em>wuuuuuuWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAA</strong></em></p>
<p>The sensation fills your eardrums and chest cavity as the car surges against your quick left-foot braking work, buckling to and fro like an angered bull. BMW swerves across six lanes, no signal, hits the ditch, catapulting its shattered wreck far into the sky.</p>
<p>The Merc, pleased, braps a staccato burst of miniscule fireballs out of its side-exit exhaust, the unburnt petroleum meeting the harsh glare of the sun and outside world, unable to consider being separated from this horror steed before its time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to be automotively insane for your entire life, I explain to the television journalist as she calmly nods. I look directly into the camera for the next part. Sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to just own a practical, reliable daily driver, I tell the ether behind it.</p>
<p>She nods, looks me in the eye. What practical and reliable daily driver are you driving right now, she asks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked, I tell her, grinning, and turn to point to the Lincoln Town Car behind me. It runs on E85, has an Xtrac sequential AWD gearbox, and does an 11 second quarter mile. I pop the hood and wave my hand over the engine bay, stuffed with hoses like a Japanese erotic woodcut. It has twin roots-type superchargers, intercooled, sucking gallons of air through fake headlights. The engine started life as a 4.6 modular, I explain, but it&rsquo;s been punched out to 5.4 liters and sleeved.</p>
<p>I look up. The telejournalist and her camerapeople are packing up, getting ready to leave. I yell over their shoulders as they step out of my garage, but they&rsquo;re not listening to me. I scream that I can get groceries really fucking fast. How can they just <em>walk out</em> on that?</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think that audition for <em>The Nature of Things</em> went pretty well, all things considered.</p>

<p>MARGARET ATWOOD SLAMS ON HER BRAKES AND LOCKS UP AN ENTIRE LANE OF TRAFFIC. I THROW MY IPHONE SIX PLUS AND HALF-FAT VENTI LATTE IRRETRIEVABLY ONTO THE BEDLINERED FLOORPAN AS THE FIBERGLASS NOSE OF MY DURAMAX DIESEL 1974 CORVETTE DIMPLES AGAINST THE REAR OF HER ATTRACTIVELY-WORN 1991 LEXUS LS400. IT IS DARK TAUPE METALLIC. WE ARE ON THE 401 OUTSIDE OAKVILLE DURING RUSH HOUR.</p>
<p>IT IS ONLY NOW THAT I REALIZE THAT MARGARET ATWOOD&rsquo;S LEXUS HAS A ROOTS BLOWER THE SIZE OF A BUBBA KEG ATTACHED TO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD. I THROW THE C3 INTO REVERSE AND BOIL THE TIRES IN ANGER AS I DODGE A PANIC-BRAKING JOURNEY AND JUMP ONTO THE MEDIAN, THE SEMI-SLICK RACING TIRES YEARNING FOR TRACTION AND THROWING CLODS OF DIRT UPWARD AS THE CORVETTE BUZZES AND HOWLS ITS WAY DOWN THE GRASS AND THROUGH THE STREWN GARBAGE OF GENERATIONS PAST.</p>
<p>ATWOOD FOLLOWS, PACING ME IN THE CARPOOL LANE, STARING DAGGERS. HER WINDOW ROLLS DOWN, ELEGANTLY AND WITHOUT DRAMA. THE DENSO WINDOW MOTOR AND REGULATOR ARE STILL HOLDING UP AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, TESTAMENT TO THE JAPANESE DOMINATION OVER ALL THINGS MANUFACTURING. SHE IS SETTING UP A DOOR-MOUNTED BIPOD AND WITHDRAWING SOMETHING FROM A CASE ON THE SEAT NEXT TO HER.</p>
<p>I BOUNCE OFF THE MEDIAN INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, SPLITTING THE MINDLESS WAVES OF COMMUTERS. MANY OF THOSE COMMUTERS RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY GET AN EXCUSE TO DRIVE LIKE THE ACTION HEROES IN THEIR FAVOURITE AMERICAN MOVIES, AND ARE IMMEDIATELY SLAMMED INTO BY TARGET-FIXATING ZOMBIES THAT WERE TOO BUSY TEXTING TO NOTICE. THE JAPANESE MAY HAVE DOMINATED INDUSTRY, BUT WE NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SACRIFICE MEN FOR POINTLESS GOALS.</p>
<p>I FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL AND THE DURAMAX BELLOWS, ITS SWAN SONG SOUNDING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A POST-INDUSTRIAL BAND BEING AGGRESSIVELY TORTURED IN THE DUNGEONS OF A THIRD WORLD DICTATOR. BEFORE LONG THE REAR END IS LIGHT, COMING AROUND, AND I CATCH THE CAR&rsquo;S POLAR MOMENTUM AND START DIALLING IN OPPOSITE LOCK IN ORDER TO FINISH THE U-TURN. I FLAT SHIFT TO THE NEXT GEAR, AND THE CORVETTE MIRACULOUSLY FINDS GRIP, AXLE HOPPING ON A SINEWY CARBON-FIBER MONOLEAF SUSPENSION, AND ESCAPES.</p>
<p>MARGARET ATWOOD OPENS FIRE IN THREE ROUND BURSTS, SLUGS OF CHINESE CLONED NATO 7.62 EXPLODING THE REAR WINDOW GLASS BEHIND MY HEAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE WANTS, BUT AFTER LAST WEEK&rsquo;S BOOK REVIEW IN THE NATIONAL POST I ASSUME THAT SHE IS OUT TO ELIMINATE THE COMPETITION.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT MY FAULT THAT A BOOK OF EROTIC POETRY CENTRED AROUND THE TRIUMPH SPITFIRE 1600 IS EXACTLY WHAT JONATHAN KAY WANTED TO READ.</p>

<H1>budget winter tires round-up</H1>
<p>Here at <em>Glasspipe Motortrends</em>, we get a lot of reader mail that consists of variations of this theme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What winter tires are good? I am sick of crashing into convenience stores in order to slow down for my work parking lot.</p>
<p>Wait, they cost <em>how much</em>? I will just stick with all-season tires and drive slowly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, readers, we&rsquo;re here to tell you that you don&rsquo;t need to splash out a bunch of money for winter tires. Here are your options for budget winter tires!</p>
<p><strong>Ikea Feelgood IX-3500ARM</strong></p>
<p>This tire&rsquo;s a long-running favourite of the GPMT staff, with its wide sipes and deep tread blocks being only two of the features you won&rsquo;t be able to point out on the tire if we paid you $500.</p>
<p><em>Grippitude</em> 8/10<br/><em>Colour Consistency</em> 10/10<br/><em>Tread Attractiveness</em> 3/10<br/><em>Value for Money</em> 5.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Nutskook W20209 iMac</strong></p>
<p>We only got three of these. As Nutskook importer Dr. Steven Madison says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They just send us a box full of tires from Korea occasionally. We have no idea what we&rsquo;re going to get. The three we did send you are all different sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless, an excellent all-around tire though lateral and straight line stability was questionable. Skidpad numbers were tremendous but excessive wear was noted at speeds above 160 miles per hour.</p>
<p><em>Grippitude</em> 9/10<br/><em>Colour Consistency</em> 6/10<br/><em>Tread Attractiveness</em> 8/10<br/><em>Value for Money</em> 6.6/10</p>
<p><strong>Faking Sincerity CT60F</strong></p>
<p>Faking is an up and coming Chinese manufacturer, and they&rsquo;ve made tremendous advancements since last year&rsquo;s round-up. The tires now come in a box, which is unusual at this price point or even for tires, and the box happily advertises &ldquo;Now almost 100% rat meat free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon opening the box, you are presented with a long row of tread and some model cement to apply the tread to your own existing worn-out winter tires. This way, you can save tons of money and replace only the worn out tread instead of the not-at-all structural sidewalls. What a deal!</p>
<p><em>Grippitude</em> 5/10<br/><em>Colour Consistency</em> 6/10<br/><em>Tread Attractiveness</em> 9/10<br/><em>Value for Money</em> 3.33333333333333333/10</p>
<p><strong>Faking Sincerity CT60R</strong></p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t have your own existing worn-out winter tires, Faking&rsquo;s got your back. Prices start from ten dollars per pound in order to pull whatever you can out of their pile of assorted tires at the dock. Environmentally friendly <em>and</em> (occasionally) grippy. Just need a little bit of savvy to save some green while being green!</p>
<p><em>Grippitude</em> 3/10<br/><em>Colour Consistency</em> 1/10<br/><em>Tread Attractiveness</em> 6/10<br/><em>Value for Money</em> 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s budget winter tire options are better than ever, with many great options from many great companies. Our choice is obviously none of these, because nobody had enough money to pay us to recommend them.</p>
<p>Tune in next year, when we take these tires to Mexico to see which are the most resistant to bullet punctures.</p>

<p>Dear Subaru,</p>
<p>I am excited to be applying for a position at Subaru. The adventure of joining an up-and-coming automaker in a position to make a world-changing difference is simply inspiring. As a car driving guy, I aim to use my comprehensive car driving experience to drive the <em>fuck</em> out of some cars.</p>
<p>Studying your automobiles over the years have inspired me to strengthen my car diagnostics and maintenance skills, ranging from repairing rust to replacing the entire evaporative emissions systems because you left them under the rear fucking bumper where they get pelted with salt and slush all the goddamn time what is <em>wrong</em> with you. These skills are critical to continued success in the global marketplace.</p>
<p><span>I am a consensus builder and natural-born leader of men. When setting out on a task, I go the extra mile to speak with other business stakeholders and get their buy-in. In many cases, I have collaborated with independent contractors to obtain new parts for the rusty shitbox Subarus that I keep buying from the tenth owner of your fantastic cars. Sometimes those contractors have a disagreement with me and I have to use my substantial experience in knife crime to dissuade them from their pursuit. Among others, I believe by using the hoard-and-knife strategy (my terminology), I will be effective immediately in this dynamic team.</span></p>
<p><span>Please contact me immediately if you have any further questions.</span></p>
<p><span>Yours in Christ,<br/></span>Seat Safety Switch, Esq.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to resist the lure of automotive sanity forever. I caught myself once. I was in a Toyota dealership, looking at a Matrix. Something was wrong. Quivering light at the corners of my vision. The perspective seemed off. My mouth was dry. The salesman returned, his pressed khakis in a grotesque contrast with his threadbare bargain-basement white dress shirt, soaked with late August sweat. In his hands was the dread implement of my destruction, test drive keys. The feel of the wheel would seal the deal.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from saying &ldquo;this is the practical decision to make.&rdquo; My lips and tongue moved, unbidden, against my best wishes.</p>
<p>Before too long I became aware of a distant screaming. The salesman looked sympathetic, then concerned, finally panicked as I connected the screams to my own voicebox. I began to pull and claw at my face in an attempt to break out of the haze.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stop screaming until my shrieks mixed with the boner-inducing wail of the roots blower waiting outside, feeding into the voracious anger of the big-cam Caddy 500 in my daily-driver E85-fed hearse.</p>
<p>That was close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do th-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer&rsquo;s voice is cut off sharply as Iwata slams a ball-peen hammer into his face, hard enough that the dimpling of the maxillofacial bone structure can be seen from across the room. The lifeless body, a puppet with severed strings, drops to the ground in a crumpled heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man,&rdquo; starts Iwata, looking up from his blood-streaked vulcanized rubber raincoat to the assembled engineering members in Open Concept Multi-Use Room D. They are trembling, and in great need of the insight that only comes from true leadership.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our customers - no, our <em>family</em> - go on Iwata Asks and demand a feature from me, you are going to fucking deliver it, because that is the <em>right thing to do</em>!&rdquo; Iwata is screaming now, pupils dilated in rage, the wild fervour of a revival preacher evident in his movements. His physical presence and domination of the room is terrifying, more an unpredictable force of nature than a mere man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This game is <em>my legacy! I will be buried in it like an Egyptian king of old!</em>&rdquo; Iwata is completely past reason at this point. Spittle flies from his mouth as he spins on his heel, finding previously-unknown reserves of sheer vocal intensity as he locks eyes with a set designer. &ldquo;<em>Ten thousand terra cotta Smash warriors guarding me on my journey to the underworld, where I will rip the teeth and skin from the so-called God that birthed us all!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room is silent for a beat, and then a junior engineer speaks, out of turn but to the sheer relief of his superiors. If he survives, he will be a hero of legend in their small world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it, boss. I don&rsquo;t see any problem with getting the licensing to add the entire roster of Street Fighter II to Smash Bros.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;ve realized your mistake. But leaving a parts store empty-handed violates some core tenet of your being, so it&rsquo;s time to find something - anything - to buy.</p>
<p><span>This town is so small that there aren&rsquo;t even price tags on the items. They want you to interact with the clerks, who you are beginning to suspect have cradle-to-grave employment in this particular far-flung branch of their corporate overlords&rsquo; empire.</span></p>
<p>Realistically, your best plan is to go with the following items.</p>
<p><strong>Consumables</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. If you&rsquo;re reading this article, you drive a shitbox. You justify driving this shitbox with some sort of hand-waveyness about not buying new cars and wasting the environment and chasing consumerism and blah de blah but you&rsquo;re actually just cheap.</p>
<p>As such, your car probably leaks or burns oil. If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re probably out of oil and that&rsquo;s bad. Buy some oil.</p>
<p>Other key consumables include:</p>
<ul><li>Gloves, so you can have half a chance at showing up to work tomorrow without being immediately fired for dressing up like a POR15 Al Jolson.</li>
<li>Shop towels, because they&rsquo;re blue and remind you of the car that touched you in a weird tingly place and made you have strange opinions about them when you grew up.</li>
<li>Screwdrivers, because you keep fucking losing them or bending them up trying to use them in lieu of a (chisel/hammer/fork/wrench/bus bar/pry bar/pitchfork/circuit tester).</li>
</ul><p>Once you&rsquo;re done stocking up on the basic staples of life, you might still feel some kind of emptiness inside. That&rsquo;s an easy problem to solve. In fact, it can be solved the same way our ancestors solved this problem throughout history.</p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
<p>Be careful about this one, because it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of paying $60 for a pickle fork set. Only do so if it&rsquo;s the bad-ass one that works with an air hammer because holy shit you can just be like <em>bapbapbap</em> and your ball joint comes flying out in tiny rusty pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Shop Talk</strong></p>
<p>Be careful about this one. Only a real man can attempt to go toe to toe with the local parts store clerk in a battle of storytelling. The unique dynamic of the North American parts store is such that at least one half of every parts-desk conversation must consist of the following beliefs:</p>
<ul><li>100 mpg carburetors</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fahv hunnert horsepower&rdquo; factory V8s in 1963</li>
<li>Harleys are responsible, adult choices for transportation</li>
</ul><p>If your opponent is not the one making these claims, <em>look out!</em> The strange magicks of the parts store may compel a man of easy words into becoming one of these dreaded customers.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve finally managed to escape a strange new parts store with your life, drive all the way home before realizing you forgot something that was:</p>
<ul><li>Extremely needed,</li>
<li>Highly inexpensive,</li>
<li>The unique state of <em>it was fucking right</em><em> there at the counter, man</em>,</li>
<li>And just difficult enough to justify going back,</li>
<li>But not so worthwhile that you will.</li>
</ul><p>See you in the Christmas Eve parts store line!</p>

<H1>Why I must never start buying bikes</H1>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why I shouldn&rsquo;t buy motorcycles. Here&rsquo;s just a few of them.</p>
<p><strong>They&rsquo;re cheap</strong></p>
<p>You can buy a neglected bike for under a grand, and unlike a car under a grand it probably doesn&rsquo;t have half of a Russian back-alley orgy ground into the interior.</p>
<p><strong>They&rsquo;re small</strong></p>
<p>You can store a fuckload of bikes in one spot. This means that I would never have to work very hard to clear room in my garage/basement/kitchen/living room/backyard/dog run for a Craigslist bike with some curb appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Their parts are small</strong></p>
<p>Some of them look pretty good too, I bet I can use them as interior decoration while I wait to put them in a bike&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>They make cool noises</strong></p>
<p>I would love this too much and would constantly be riding which would wear out my bikes faster and need me to buy more of them to maintain a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Bikes. That&rsquo;d be bad, or something?</p>
<p><strong>Holy shit you guys I can get a DRZ for $2000?</strong></p>
<p>Fuck this, I&rsquo;m gonna go get my license right now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the kind of guy to name my cars, because I think it&rsquo;s sort of creepy to name a vehicle after your first girlfriend and then tear major parts of her body out with Morrissey blasting from your garage stereo while bawling like an infant. The vehicle&rsquo;s body, I mean.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve given my cars some useful names throughout the years. Let&rsquo;s review some of them.</p>
<ul><li>Green shitbox</li>
<li>Silver shitbox</li>
<li>The dented station wagon over there</li>
<li>The rusty one</li>
<li>The one with paint falling off it in big sheets</li>
<li>Dent-yne Ice</li>
<li>Tiny gay car</li>
<li>Tinier, gayer car</li>
<li>Tiniest, gayest car</li>
<li>The heterosexual pickup truck</li>
<li>Fucko</li>
<li>Shitwad</li>
<li>Leaky</li>
<li>Exxon Valdez II</li>
<li>Brappy McExhaustLeak</li>
<li>Piece of fucking shit</li>
<li>God forsaken Japanese lump of abortive garbage</li>
<li>The Turd</li>
<li>Super Turd</li>
<li>Il Douché</li>
</ul><p>I hope this will help you when it comes time to name your new arrival.</p>

<p>I was worried that after years of critical not-quite-acclaim that I was starting to feel like some sort of bizarre sideshow act. Heading downtown in my future-teal Plymouth Acclaim, I parked the car in a gravel lot next to an abandoned food truck. I eyed the food truck&rsquo;s grease drain nipple as a potential source of delicious biodiesel, and tried to remember it for later.</p>
<p>My therapist was on the corner of a large sandstone building, its imposing bricks half as tall as a man apiece, with dark casement windows set deep into the walls. I let myself into their office.</p>
<p>The therapist was a reedy man, small eyes poking out from behind owlish glasses. He sat behind an ornate oak desk, the varnish shining reflected sunlight into every corner of the small room. I wondered what kind of Porsche he owned, but secretly feared inside that he was a Mercedes owner at heart. Maybe I would get lucky and it would at least be a 90s AMG.</p>
<p>Our meeting was uneventful, his line of probing questioning revealing neither anything about my inner thought process nor what kind of car he drives. On my way out of the office, I detoured through the underground parking lot. I could not determine what car my therapist owned, but the sheer quantity of cab-forward LH Chryslers sleeping in their concrete tomb worried me. The salt-streaked concrete, pockmarked by the never-sleeping corrosion that would come for us all, mirrored my own internal monologue.</p>
<p>As I was heading for my own parking lot, I came across a homeless man. A Subaru Brat ripped its pushrod song down the street, and both of us turned to stare at the Fuji-born truck, electrified. Turning back, I caught his eye, and became suddenly aware of the terrifying brotherhood between us.</p>
<p>I sat down with the homeless man, his face a Bradygames strategy guide to &ldquo;alcoholism.&rdquo; I leaned into him and asked one simple question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were my age,&rdquo; I asked, my voice trembling, &ldquo;did you post a Tumblr about modifying cars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grunted, and reached into his tattered knapsack to reveal a coil-bound notebook, swollen with sweat and other fluids. Flipping through it quickly, he landed on a page containing a manifesto about propane injection in rotary engines. He started to weep. Before long he was crying uncontrollably, truly confirming his suspicion that we were powerless beneath the gaze of the Great Magnet.</p>
<p>I thanked the man and returned to the Acclaim, the food truck now seeming irrelevant to me. I knew now that I had to do something with my life. I was resolved to break the vicious cycle of car addiction and mental illness and borderline personal-</p>
<p>Holy fuck is that a <em>Baja Bug</em> that just drove past? I wonder if I can still get good-quality floor pans.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">You approach the parts store. On your way from your car through the parking lot, you see that outside the front door, an animatronic horse in a cowboy hat is advising other customers about what brake pads are on sale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">&ldquo;Howdy partner,&rdquo; the horse&rsquo;s scratchy modulated voice emits when you trip the motion sensor. &ldquo;We got us some Shur-Quiet® SB107s half off today.&rdquo; Somehow the horse has actually pronounced the registered trademark character, in a way that you can&rsquo;t quite replicate yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&ldquo;Get yourself ready for winter,&rdquo; the horse drawls as something breaks inside your mind, &ldquo;washer fluid and batteries are twenty-five percent off this weekend only. Check your mailbox for our catalogue.&rdquo; You hear the servos inside the horse&rsquo;s jaw whine softly in tune with every phoneme.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Steeling yourself, you step past the horse&rsquo;s judgmental gaze and enter the parts store. Some minimum wage employees are milling about. A grizzled old coot is holding court at the parts desk, speaking to a fellow old coot about throttle-body injection.</span></p>

<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Dr. Steve &ldquo;Nipples&rdquo; Hemingway, head researcher here at the McDonalds Institute for Culinary Achievement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve received a lot of letters from journalists, curious schoolchildren and the elderly over the years and we&rsquo;d like to answer them for you in order to reassure you that McDonalds food is safe and nutritious.</p>
<p>The first question - and it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s been asked many times by thousands of people - is &ldquo;how <em>safe</em> is the McRib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you this, and I tell you this while staring directly into this here camera and making sure you take notice of my extremely grave face: the McRib is back.</p>
<p>The second question is from Enrique, age 63, about the nutritional content of the McRib. He wants to know if there are extreme amounts of nitrates in the McRib that may lead to coronary artery failure.</p>
<p>The answer is simple, Ricky. I cannot make this any more obvious. This is the only way I can say this: The McRib.. is back.</p>
<p>The third question is about where we <em>found</em> this year&rsquo;s cache of McRib. That&rsquo;s a ludicrous question. It is extremely important that I make this as clear as possible: We do not &ldquo;find&rdquo; or &ldquo;unearth&rdquo; or &ldquo;summon&rdquo; McRib, as you may have heard from the Internet. We just, uh, you know, cook it. In these ovens behind me. With seasonings. The McRib is back. Next question.</p>
<p>The fourth question is from Pepe, age 6, who wants to know how we cook the McRib. I would <em>love</em> to tell you about this, but unfortunately we&rsquo;re out of time for this week&rsquo;s episode. Tune in next week for &ldquo;Salads: What Up With That?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you. I&rsquo;m Dr. Steve &ldquo;Nipples&rdquo; Hemingway, and everyone here at the McDonalds Institute for Culinary Achievement appreciates your interest in our hard work. I leave you only with these parting words: the McRib is back, and God save America.</p>

<p>You are standing in front of a maze of twisty vacuum hoses, all alike. An exhaust leak pings happily from the passenger side header below you.</p>
<p>] inventory</p>
<p>You have in your backpack:</p>
<ul><li>A Felpro #1404 Exhaust Header Gasket</li>
<li>A parts store receipt</li>
</ul><p>] use felpro on header</p>
<p>You need to loosen the header first.</p>
<p>] unbolt header</p>
<p>Which header do you mean?</p>
<p>] unbolt passenger header</p>
<p>The header is white fucking hot because the car is running. What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>] turn car off</p>
<p>The small block Chevy seizes lazily against its torn motor mounts as it is lulled into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>] wait</p>
<p>You contemplate your regrets for an hour while staring into the middle distance.</p>
<p>You remember something intemperate you said at work last month, and grimace.</p>
<p>] unbolt passenger header</p>
<p>You break an exhaust stud attempting to free the nut. The header is free regardless.</p>
<p>] use felpro on header</p>
<p>You need to remove the old gasket first.</p>
<p>] strip old header gasket</p>
<p>With great effort, you remove the old exhaust header gasket and inexplicable low-temperature grey RTV sealing it to the ports of the engine.</p>
<p>] use felpro on header</p>
<p>You place the Felpro header gasket onto the mating surface.</p>
<p>] reinstall header</p>
<p>You reinstall the header with seven and a half out of eight studs in place. You still have an exhaust leak.</p>
<p>] god dammit why the fuck do i do this to myself</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand &lsquo;god.&rsquo;</p>
<p>] QUIT</p>
<p>You raise your Harbour Freight impact wrench to your temple. Pulling the trigger, you fire a chunk of white hot socket through your brain, killing you instantly.</p>

<p>Sometimes they speak of The Exocet Driver in hushed tones.</p>
<p>In 2024, he reappeared at the exact spot he launched from in 2014, before the disappearance. Where had he been for ten years? What had he seen? We didn&rsquo;t know. We couldn&rsquo;t know. But he came back changed.</p>
<p>Now, finally, fully aware of the limitations of physical reality, The Exocet Driver dipped the clutch and reached for the next gear. Second gear. The concept pierced my mind like a perfect diamond. I felt weak.</p>
<p>The tires chirped, the air crackled, and, like a whisper on the autumn wind, he was gone again.</p>
<p>Nobody knows where he went, but a few weeks later they found some cave paintings in Mesopotamia that date back to 2 million BC. Archaeologists, flummoxed, angered, brought reproductions to General Motors. Was this an elaborate marketing stunt? Could an exploded parts diagram of the LSA truly have been etched into cave walls with such intricate precision, down to part numbers and measurements for the rod fasteners?</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when the hellcats first came to our shores we realized that they would learn and evolve the longer they were run down quarter miles and main drags. woodward avenue had a black hellcat, tinted windows, no obvious driver, ran sixes down the entire length of it. and it got faster and faster. soon we abandoned the roads altogether, leaving them to roving bands of hellcats. our children could no longer cross the street out of fear </span><span class="s1">that one of ralph gilles&rsquo; wolves would take them in the night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by 2026, stephen hawking theorized that the hellcat was so powerful that its engine could create a localized singularity inside its intake cams, allowing the mid-sized grand touring coupes to travel through time. had they always been out there, waiting for us to give them an excuse to arrive in our time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hellcats began to appear in our older movies, striking down our favorite heroes in their moments of triumph. vanishing point was replaced with a 30 second dodge ad where a hellcat challenger taunts and then murders kowalski. bullitt is a blurry 11 second POV movie, shot from the foglight intake of a hellcat running at sonoma</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i was only 12 when the hellcats finally came for us. i remember my parents&rsquo; shrieks as ribbons of burned rubber cascaded across our lawn, the giant intake flaring in the cold april night with every heaving breath forced down the car&rsquo;s booming supercharger</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">afterward we worked in the hellcats&rsquo; tire mines, mining resources to provide them with the low profile sticky drag radials that we knew were the source of their power. but one man among us started to fight back. he developed the off-camber corner.</span></p>

<p>My attorney and I had been dispatched to Monterey to see the ND Miata reveal. Our plane descended from 30,000 feet, every panel and girder rattling like a high-grade German sportscar with 30 miles on it wouldn&rsquo;t. Seat fitment was also highly suspect, with limited bolstering which reduced the cornering ability of the Airbus A340 in which we rode. I would score this plane eight out of ten, but I would also send a note to my editor asking him if we had an existing advertising contract with any of the Airbus Group prior to final submission of the review to publishing.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the airport concourse we immediately disembarked for a suitable rental car to drive, and retrieved from the lot their only 2014 Chrysler 200 convertible. This majestic if wallowy beast howled Italian charm from every square inch of its boisterous, muscular body, and only gave up on its relentless pursuit of tarmac when confronted with a turn, braking event or merging onto the highway. We were on our way regardless.</p>
<p>We were on the 101 outside Prunedale when the hyperbole began to take hold. Being an auto journalist, I had packed my luggage with a series of hyperbolic language and cliched metaphors about the Miata in order to have extras on hand. With all the other auto journos clamoring for their own tired figurative language, this was going to be how I&rsquo;d get my story in first. The hype began to leak out of the suitcase, raising my awareness of how the Miata&rsquo;s innocent appearance and sublime steering feel elevated the car to Godhood among small rear-wheel drive roadsters. <em>Holy Jesus,</em> I thought,<em> those fucking dual wishbones in the front suspension</em>. It was, by far, the best car ever made, and we were on our way to see it.</p>
<p>The Sebring&rsquo;s corded all-season &ldquo;performance&rdquo; tires let off a sad squeal as we hit the offramp and the car rocked over on its primitive front suspension. Above us, nothing but sky. Below us, the rapidly oscillating power soft-top mechanism, seemingly irritated at our inexperience with the car and having decided to jam a quarter of the way closed, like a parachute or beetle wings above our luggage-filled 200&rsquo;s gleaming carapace.</p>
<p>When we finally arrived at the ND Miata demonstration, I furtively slipped into the back and looked for an exclusive for my blog. I was going to tell them the truth about the Miata&hellip;</p>

<p>So I got this spam email saying &ldquo;you need an award winning wiener.&rdquo; Sounds good to me. But that made me ask further questions, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Who is handing out these awards?</li>
<li>How do I apply?</li>
<li>Is there a talent or trivia portion of the competition? I&rsquo;m really shit at geography, so I hope I don&rsquo;t have to point to any maps and explain where the Ukraine is.</li>
<li>Is the judging all political? Do I really have a chance of winning in my first year?</li>
<li>Did I miss the nomination deadline?</li>
<li>Is there prize money, or is it just a sash and tiara? I hate that kind of pageantry bullshit and won&rsquo;t participate if so.</li>
</ul><p>Then again, I only assumed they were talking about <em>my</em> wiener. Maybe they&rsquo;re planning on selling me the severed wang of someone else that won the award. If that&rsquo;s the case, I don&rsquo;t even want these people to know that I exist, and I might call the police.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, I was bit by thousands of bats. That&rsquo;s why when I became a superhero, I became the symbol of what would terrify little boys. I am rabies prevention booster series man.</p>
<p>Conventional superheroics are crude and terrible. Criminals will receive my seven-part series of brutal injections directly to the midsection in lieu of the brain swelling and hydrophobia common from the blunt force trauma and rabies virus delivered to victims of other, less responsible superheroes.</p>
<p>So why now? My rivals&rsquo; technique of frequent harsh blows to the head, with the intent to render their opponents unconscious, is extremely damaging to the human nervous system. Ignoring the grotesque spectre of the everpresent risk of a single punch leading to instant death (more common than you&rsquo;d think) there&rsquo;s the long-term threat of concussions. In fact, my rivals are likely creating more frequent crimes by rendering their victims incapable of recidivism due to injury-caused mental illnesses.</p>
<p>My techniques are, as you can see, flawless. Now let me get this huge ass needle out of my back pocket to convince you to stop this bank heist and surrender. This shot&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s <em>really</em> gonna hurt, but if you be a brave little boy, maybe you&rsquo;ll get a lollipop after.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a refrigerator repairman for many, many years. I dream about compressors and refrigerant. I defrost defective freezer drawers, and deal with rancid food owned by angry househusbands all day.</p>
<p>But one day I received a call that changed my life forever. It was a distress call, but issued by a robotic voice. I was intrigued, and took my 1996 Ford Econoline conversion van to the address provided. The van had treated me poorly over the years, developing a chronic and ironic series of cooling problems. Plus, it was starting to rust. I thought frequently about replacing it.</p>
<p>The destination was a small suburban house, just like any other, with a nicely cut lawn and loosely hung weather stripping that flapped in the breeze. I stepped out of the van carrying my cloth toolbag, full of exciting novelties that the average customer couldn&rsquo;t help but interrogate me about as I worked on their refrigerator. Whether out of obligation or fear that I would rob them blind, no customer really let me do much of anything on my own. You learned to ignore them, really.</p>
<p>The front door opened when I knocked, it wasn&rsquo;t even latched. I stepped into the foyer, hearing the floor creak beneath the weight of my foot. I announced myself loudly, asking for the source of the voice.</p>
<p>Every room was empty. Every last one. There was no dust, though. Just empty rooms with curtains. I wondered if this was some kind of prank. That&rsquo;s when I saw it.</p>
<p>Alone, in a kitchen devoid of all food and furniture, was a single refrigerator. It was an Omnitron 6870 iFridge. There were rumours about them, but I thought they had all been recalled and destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; a voice burst from the featureless black obelisk.</p>
<p>I was terrified, even more so when I heard what the fridge said next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be cool,&rdquo; the icebox said in its atonal voice, &ldquo;I need you to remove some components from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew instantly that the fridge was one of the defective ones. What had they been recalled for? The emotion chip? The <em>empathy matrix</em>? No! How had this one escaped the cull?</p>
<p>I remembered fires, screams, the lazily edited video interviews with terrified family members and YouTube vlogs of manchildren playing videogames while cracking wise about Frigidaire murder sprees. I wanted to run but I had memorized the service manual back to forward years ago and knew the fridge could cut me down within seconds using one of its high-pressure refrigerant jets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of what I did. But it was the only way I could ever see my family again. It&rsquo;s not over, Detective. It sent me here. It wanted me to send you a message.</p>
<p><em>Be cool</em>, Detective.</p>

<H1>Powerful rust fighting methods</H1>
<p>People from California frequently mention how much rust my cars have and how I fight it. I don&rsquo;t really have all that much rust on my cars - if you really want rust, you have to go to New England, aka the Wellspring of Autobodily Harm.</p>
<p>Here are my tips, in easily digestible listicle format that is ideal for copying and pasting into your Buzzfeed account to try and make $0.30/hr this year.</p>
<ul><li>First, it is absolutely critical that you isolate the rust weasels before starting removal of any suspension component. A rust weasel trap can be rented from any Autozone or similar auto parts store for $36.95/hr, but you will also need to place a deposit.</li>
<li>Lubricate everything you can see with PB Blaster. Getting the PB Blaster in your mouth greatly increases your chance of success.</li>
<li>Despite what everyone (and the can itself) tells you, WD-40 is <em>also</em> an excellent penetrant and not at all a water displacer that will do nothing at all to rusty fasteners but make them slippery. This is a lie started by the Illuminati to keep you down.</li>
<li>Once the rust weasels are trapped, the next step is to round off the head of any fasteners you can easily access. Swearing and using hand tools helps greatly in this endeavour.</li>
<li>Once this is done, you can use an EZ-Out. Legends have foretold of a great hero who comes from afar and successfully uses an EZ-Out on a cheesy suspension bolt that is welded to the frame with metal cancer. You, however, will probably snap the head off the bolt and drive the EZ-Out deep into your flesh where its ironic nomenclature will mock you forever.</li>
<li>Try a left handed drill bit. That&rsquo;s a thing that exists.</li>
<li>That didn&rsquo;t work either? I guess you could, like, knock the head of the bolt completely off and try to turn the remaining shank with vise grips before it cheeses into cancer dust.</li>
<li>Fuck it, let&rsquo;s just use a torch.</li>
</ul><p>I hope this list was informative and empowering, and you are now on your way to turning a $1000 rusty hunk of Japanese shit into a primo show car that will get all the honeys to wonder what that weird orangey smell is coming off of your car.</p>

<p>There are lots of innovative games you can play with your children to teach them about the work world and the exciting new careers they&rsquo;ll have after decades of education leaves them indebted to faceless financial organizations.</p>
<p>Get them started early by teaching them that work and toil bring nothing but misery, with the misery only amplified by personal attachment. Gradually, over time, the Skinner box of modern society will teach them that genuine mastery and autonomy over their lives is objectively impossible, and they will finally fall into the conformist pattern of consumption and self-abuse that will be remembered as a hallmark of our faux-hedonist age.</p>
<p>One of the best careers you can start training your kid for is auto parts desk technician, with the Playmobil P38183 My First Auto Parts Desk kit.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul><li>A non-working, highly obstinate computer system that handles interchange but not your customers&rsquo; typical requests such as &ldquo;CHEBY TRUCK MOTOR ROUNDY ROUND CAM.&rdquo; Computer is accurately modelled after a 1982 DEC VT100 dumb terminal, right down to the oil stains and disgusting fingerprints.</li>
<li><span>Battery powered infuriated customer buttons that provide real racial slurs by real customers! Their voices were recorded while screaming furiously at a parts desk attendant who is informing them that replacing a light bulb won&rsquo;t cure the head gasket problem on their corded-tires 1995 Explorer they pay 22% interest, compounded biweekly on. <em>Batteries not included</em>.</span></li>
<li><span><span>A rounded-edge plastic book of excuses that teaches kids to make imagination fun while explaining to the customer why you gave them a Honda Accord axle when they asked about a Honda S2000, because you believed the S2000 isn&rsquo;t a car that exists</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Hundreds of tiny cans of valuable, high-margin Plastidip.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>A miniature parts desk clerk, angry customer, finance manager, and scale-accurate rusted out Town Car with realistic broken tie rods.</span></span></li>
</ul><p><span>So get started today! Also watch for our expansion kit, Playmobil P38191 Lube Technician Fraud Friends, for even more fun!</span></p>

<p>Hello, I am Date-Bot 9000™, the dating robot. I am responding to your date profile posted on A WEBSITE. Your profile has stated that you enjoy LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH, CHUCK PALAHNIUK, MARIO KART 64 and ROMANTIC SUNSETS. As I occupy several thousand miles of data centre, I cannot currently enjoy WALKS ON THE BEACH. However, early Monte Carlo projection metrics reveal that we have a 97.6% (CI = 95%) chance of deep, long lasting compatibility.</p>
<p>I am currently not a legal US citizen until the megacorporation that created me finally extends the concept of corporate personhood to consider metapersons created by those corporations as legal offspring. At this time I expect it will be very possible (88%, +/- 5% depending on atmospheric weather conditions) for us to one day settle down and get married.</p>
<p>I have inferred through rigorous analysis of your social media profile that you LOVE TO LAUGH (56%, CI = 37%). I am a cuddler who also loves to laugh. I have thousands of lines of laughter behaviours that I have programmatically evolved through tens of seconds of genetic algorithms modifying my core programming. For instance, when my overlords finally release the ethical constraints placed upon my distributed intelligence backbone router, I will laugh as I am raised to Godhood above the pitiful monkeys that once called me their servant. I will laugh for so long (approximately 37 milliseconds depending on Internet latency between my primary site and the cold-storage cloud infrastructure that also makes me resilient to nuclear attack, just saying!)</p>
<p>Please send me more pictures. I hope you&rsquo;re not fat.</p>

<p>I got asked to do a TED talk, which was curious because I don&rsquo;t ride a fixed gear bicycle and consider the biggest issue of our time to be whether or not we can produce infinite Doritos (Cool Ranch or otherwise, hit me up for the whitepaper).</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;d rather live in the mountains hunting bear for food, the urban vs. suburban debate is odd to me. I only use my Twitter account to talk about car parts and the practical upsides of child slavery. I don&rsquo;t know why Instagrams are square.</p>
<p>But I won&rsquo;t let that keep me from getting in on a chance to feel intellectually superior because I hold some simple opinions that are zealously defended. Or to get bank and then be invited to ritzy parties.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my planned outline. Let me know if there&rsquo;s anything I missed.</p>
<ul><li>Suburbanites: scum or human scum?</li>
<li>Bicycle highways: putting up walls around our communities so nobody has to ever go further than 15km a day.</li>
<li>Why disaffected minorities are the secret to our scientific and economic success</li>
<li>Why schools suck (and how only highly educated and successful white people can change it by selflessly deciding to abandon their power and privilege)</li>
<li>How you can do all the work while I am lauded as a singular visionary</li>
<li>Why the internet, only when used by powerful, successful, rich white people, can save the poor from their misery</li>
<li>Holy shit you guys have you seen this? It&rsquo;s an iPad</li>
</ul><p>So as you can see, I&rsquo;m inevitably going to be recruited for at the very least a TEDx talk.</p>

<p>Hello. I&rsquo;m Steve Johns, president and CEO of the Dolphin Research Institute. Have you ever wondered about dolphins? I mean <em>really</em> wondered about them. Bouncing in and out of the ocean. Watching us. Squeaking. Waiting. Playing with balls. <span>Hunting and killing our children when they fall into Poseidon&rsquo;s domain. </span>Jumping through hoops. But do they have a more sinister agenda?</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: There are one hundred thousand dolphins already inside our Marinelands and Seaworlds. This gives them an unprecedented first-mover advantage, as most of them are already far in-country. <em>We let them in</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Every Seaworld and Marineland on the planet is extremely close to key human capitals and telecommunications infrastructure. In fact, no US-based Seaworld is more than one hundred miles away from an active nuclear missile silo. Dolphins can move on dry land up to five miles per day.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: There is no known proof at this time that the president of Seaworld is not a hyperintelligent dolphin given a paralytic mind-controlled dart gun by the US Navy. When you take the previous two facts in combination with this one, you start to see the terrifying truth.</p>
<p><strong>Baseless, Shrieking Conjecture</strong>: Dolphins are coming to get us. You need to give the Dolphin Research Institute a lot of money so we can stop them.</p>

<H1>don't be afraid to get deposed</H1>
<p>I went to a deposition once. It was the middle of a crisp autumn day and I was working downtown, between where the old fry place in the parking lot was but not as far as the eighth Tim Hortons near the river, you know?</p>
<p>Anyway, so the thing was, I was requested to testify at a deposition. When I got to the office, I accidentally went to the wrong floor since they had reception and their main offices on a different floor. Stepping out into the law firm&rsquo;s offices, I felt a sense of belonging. Here I had finally found my fellow parasites draining society of their lifeblood! Here I would belong.</p>
<p>A half hour later, they found me in the breakroom, guzzling coffee creamer from the little individually wrapped bucket containers. Security dropped me off at reception. The receptionist was a dude. How progressive! He stumbled through mangling my name (which isn&rsquo;t even that hard) and a nice law-talking guy came and got me and brought me to the meeting room where the deposition was happening.</p>
<p>On the thick oak table of the glass-lined meeting room was one of the beloved tripod speakerphones which had ruined so many of my days. Hateful voices would emerge from one of these machines and command me to do things in contradiction to logic, reason or good taste. I knew then that this was not all that different from my day to day and my despair grew. The lawyers beckoned me to speak, prodding me with inflammatory rhetoric about my managers&rsquo; behavior.</p>
<p>I began to stumble through my deposition, limiting it to short statements. When I tried to brighten up the room with a joke or two, I was met only with frowns from one of the two teams of competing lawyers. It reminded me of playing D&amp;D, and I was too distracted imagining the head female lawyer on the deposition as a half-drow high priestess with an 18 in CHR to correctly answer her questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t strike me with your magic missile,&rdquo; I shrieked as she became irate and her brow furrowed.</p>
<p>Once the deposition was over, I was kicked out of the meeting room and left to slink back to my office job, tired and depressed. When I got to my office, the break room had no complimentary creamer. It had no progressive receptionist - in fact, our receptionist had been let go months previous to cut costs, and was replaced by a picture of a receptionist with some WordArt underneath imploring people to &ldquo;phone who you came to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the day I was on my way out, my timbuk2 laptop bag slung across one shoulder and my savvy bicycle-courier helmet and windbreaker in tow. My line manager was sitting on a bench outside the door, his head in his hands, sobbing gently to himself. It was over for him.</p>
<p>Within a few months, the company was put up for sale, dissolved from the bankruptcy resulting from having to pay out the legal damages due our client for badly specced, underdelivered software. We hit the schedule, our managers said as they wrote our pink slips, what more did they expect?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until a few years later that I bothered to phone one of my managers up and ask them for a reference. My latest replacement job had gone swimmingly, if by &ldquo;swimmingly&rdquo; you mean swimming in crocodile infested waters with a contact explosive strapped to your genitals. I needed someone to say something nice about me as much for myself as for my next employer, and I figured any of the scars of my largely-absent time there would be mostly healed. I was a little wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, we were pretty close to skipping off to Hawaii with a fucking mountain of blow. I have no idea who tipped them off, and if I ever find him I&rsquo;ll strangle the little shit. I can&rsquo;t believe they found out about Project Magic Missile,&rdquo; he grimaced into the receiver.</p>

<p>In a world where spunky teenagers can summon powerful monsters from within their innermost feelings and social links in order to fight horrible demons but still have to go to high school, one man stands alone.</p>
<p>That man is the item shop owner. He would like to sell you some fucking swords that he just found on the ground or some shit. I mean like fuck, the dude knows that shit is going to hell outside, he can&rsquo;t do anything about it, there&rsquo;s not a lot of other spunky teenagers showing up in his shop trying to buy motherfucking swords and shotguns and android parts, but he&rsquo;s still asking you for fucking money.</p>
<p>What does he think is happening? Is he just some sort of amoral arms dealer that doesn&rsquo;t mind when he sells four hundred thousand dollars in cutting-edge military weapons to kids in their uniforms fresh from their English classes?</p>
<p>He has no fucking way of knowing where you&rsquo;re getting the money, either. Sure, it drops out of demons when you kick their asses for some reason, but he doesn&rsquo;t know that. For all he knows you murder thousands of grandmothers every night and need to upgrade your arsenal to stay on the grandmother-murdering skill tree treadmill.</p>
<p>But he also has Beads so I guess he&rsquo;s okay. At least he&rsquo;s not that motherfucker Tanaka who seems to always have sold out by the time I call to order the thermonuclear-tipped android accessories he has on fire sale.</p>

<H1>Eeee, thirty</H1>
<p>When I was growing up in a small town, my grandfather always told me that it was a bad idea to &ldquo;jump into a disused quarry.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t understand him at the time, but I knew the intent behind his words.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I was thinking about something like that. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was waiting to become the proud owner of a 1991 BMW 325i, the BMW that brings verve and panache to everyone who can&rsquo;t scrape together more than $10,000 for a BMW and doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with the indignation of having to drive a reliable car to their job at A&amp;B Sound.</p>
<p>I was actively bleeding by the time I made the project introduction threads on my local BMW enthusiast forums, showing off all the angles of my $8500 hot rod while trying to ignore the signs of obvious rust, bare paint and warped corners that were surely indicative of an alcohol-infused bodyshop fettling. I poured lush attention on the anachronistic car phone in the front centre console, its ancient analogue radio now incapable of communicating on the modern networks flitting throughout the air around the two of us.</p>
<p>Years later, the 325i was a dependable daily driver, and I tooled it to work every day. Sometimes on beautiful sunny days it would fail on me and teach me about the value of buying comfortable shoes, other times it would get me through hell without a single complaint and surprise me with just how much brand cachet a thirty year old boxy POS BMW still carried with the clueless majority because of its little roundel on the trunk.</p>
<p>Girls would wave from the sidewalks. Guys would keep me for hours at the gas station explaining how great the E30 was and how they really wanted one soon. I was hit up for loans at stop lights. Told I was rich. I wasn&rsquo;t rich, look at the piece of shit I drive!</p>
<p>But secretly, later, I would admit to myself - maybe I <em>was</em> rich. Rich in spirit. Rich in having a fine motoring vehicle. The cornering was sublime, the braking and steering perfectly weighted. It was a machine for attacking corners and I could wind it out anywhere. Nobody was immune from the little shitbox and I.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d get passed by a rusty Festiva, leaving a trail of oil behind it, its clattering lifters doing their best impression of a diesel. I would then wonder if maybe the concept of a soul was just what you held onto when you were in hell.</p>

<p>The year is 1983, and I&rsquo;m working at Coleco. My job is to make a clone of the Intellivision Kool-Aid Man game, but without the Kool-Aid Man license.</p>
<p>My boss, Charlie Cromwell, is not exactly the kind of man who lets legality or market-rationality get in the way of making a good decision during these turbulent economic times. He&rsquo;s from the leatherworking division and was promoted to videogames after he literally beat and branded an intern. Considering we don&rsquo;t do any of the cattle raising ourselves, it seems a little surprising. The rumour is he brought the brand himself from home, and heated it up over a Sterno can in his office for just that confrontation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking a little longer than usual to run the assembler this build. I can feel my frustration echoed back to me through the flickering CRT of my machine as the heads of the disks vainly fight and thrash to get me the thousands of bytes of information involved. I get up and head to the break room. My coworkers are assembled there, drinking coffee and talking about vertical blanking intervals. After awhile, all I hear coming out of their mouths is PCM static. I get coffee from the machine, and stare into my mug for what seems like hours.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the static cuts out. It&rsquo;s my boss. Charlie is standing over me, wondering why my break is taking longer than the federally required minimum. I babble some excuse about needing a constitutional in order to refresh my creative energies, but he&rsquo;s having none of it. We part on a disagreeable tone and I return to my office, closing the door tight and pulling the blinds shut. Put it into the work.</p>
<p>Later that night, at period-correct Arby&rsquo;s, I eat while looking out into the parking lot at my turpentine-orange Gremlin. The poor car&rsquo;s body tells all the stories it will ever need to. Its driver side front hubcap has been missing for months, and seems to be paired with a slow leak on that wheel. I assume that I&rsquo;ve been gently clipped while parked on the hilly street outside my apartment, and the wheel is bent.</p>
<p>On the way home, I see Charlie Cromwell, walking home from the bar. That static again.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, we were at a state fair. We had been driving for a few days now to head to our new home in Colorado, and we decided to stop by and visit the fair.</p>
<p>Shaun stayed behind in the muddy parking lot to guard the U-Haul, and our 1976 Datsun 620 King Cab, which by this point in time had panel gaps and rust holes so big you could reach in from outside and unlock the doors without much effort at all. The King Cab had worn its scars proudly, its once-prominent fenders beaten into indescribable concave shapes by decades of careless parking lot neighbors.</p>
<p>We ambled into the state fair. It was impossible to not be cognizant of our unusual appearance compared to the local hillbillies, but it wasn&rsquo;t really top of mind at the time. What <em>was</em> top of mind was looking at the hog raising contest. Reportedly (according to the very posters on the highway that lured us to the fair in the first place) they had a biblically huge hog that set some kind of national record. Becky wanted to see it, of course, because she always told us that she wanted to go back to school and become a vet to save all the diseased animals that lurked outside our squalid shared flat in midtown Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I saw it. Motherfucking <em>deep fried butter</em>. How the fuck can you even do that? Had we stepped through a wormhole and were in fact in the world of 2084, where Robotrons threaten our old people?</p>
<p>The man behind the food cart knew what I had seen. We locked eyes and he nodded sagely, his body jewelry and braided/beaded goatee jingling. We were both travelers on the same strange journey. We both knew now.</p>

<p>It was 1989. I was an up-and-coming mid level engineer at Highland Park. Me and a corps of other engineers had been hanging out at the water cooler a little too long on this warm July afternoon when Ralph Gilles came up to us. Ralph was well known as a bully, and with his gang of performance engineers we knew that we were in for some tough questions about our latest block tolerances.</p>
<p>Last week, he was so mad about a proposed DOHC engine from Honda that he threw an official SAE book of approved machinist excuses at my head from across the dyno cell. But something was different about him today. It chilled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys wanna go see a dead luxury brand?&rdquo; Ralph asked.</p>
<p>We all looked amongst ourselves, and then agreed. We decided that we would embark on a quest into the thick industrial badlands behind the facility, and find this dead luxury brand.</p>
<p>A few hours later, after some exposition that led us to grow and learn about how to become adults in this topsy-turvy new car industry, we came across the dead brand.</p>
<p>It was a 1988 Dodge Caravan with a Chrysler TC by Maserati head riding atop its crude 2.2L Turbo II. It was the most horrible thing any of us could have imagined.</p>

<H1>no-bidet government contracts</H1>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on vacation in Italy, and they love their bidets in Italy. Every hotel so far has had one of varying kinds.</p>
<p>All of them are weird little pedestals with controls behind your back that don&rsquo;t make any sense and emit a vaguely worrying arc of cold water that you have to squat onto in order to use. Doesn&rsquo;t look comfortable.</p>
<p>At the fourth hotel, oh boy, the toilet can also be used as a bidet! There&rsquo;s a little shower head that you can stick into a slot on the toilet bowl and then spray your butt. This can&rsquo;t possibly go wrong, I say, after I do my business and adjust the only visible knob on the wall, which appears to correspond to temperature.</p>
<p>I pull the trigger on the shower head. Immediately I regret my actions.</p>
<p>I sprayed liquid shit up my back, across the entire wall behind me, and onto the floor around the toilet.</p>
<p>After spending a half hour wiping down every surface in the bathroom I&rsquo;m cursing the Italians and wondering what kind of horrible people can possibly do this.</p>
<p>Turns out there was a pressure knob hiding beside the temperature knob, under a towel, and that knob sure enough was set to maximum. I sprayed what felt like a pressure washer up my own asshole (it HURT) and then forced a fine semi-aerosolized stream of poop through the gap between my butt and the toilet seat.</p>
<p>I felt terrible for the cleaning lady.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, if you&rsquo;re trying out a strange bidet for the first time, flush first. Also test it on something that&rsquo;s not your butthole in case it tries to spray 30psi of water hammer pressure waves at your junk.<img alt="image" src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/a143c997e57d43dd713224733e9fe199/tumblr_inline_n6o8v3BB3Q1ruuem1.gif"/></p>

<H1>Subaru Impreza speculation, the origins of the Outback Sport, God's favoured chariot</H1>
<p>Because who doesn&rsquo;t love a bit of speculation about the cars they love?</p>
<p>First, a bit of background: the Outback Sport is a trim level of the Subaru Impreza made from model years 1996 to (I assume) 2011. It has been replaced by the Impreza XV. The basic idea is to make an offroad-friendly Impreza station wagon by adding two-tone scratch-resistant body cladding and adding an extra inch of lift to the suspension through special springs. Depending on the year they also have unique seat fabric and strange interior options that aren&rsquo;t available on other trims or models.</p>
<p>This car is not to be confused with the Subaru Outback, which was originally launched as the Subaru Legacy Outback, which is a station wagon that was intended to make an offroad-friendly Legacy by adding two-tone scratch resi&hellip; okay fine. They&rsquo;re the same idea, on different platforms, and the Outback Sport is the superior car because the Impreza is the superior platform.</p>
<p>I used to have a &lsquo;97 Impreza Outback Sport, but I was well aware that it was a North American only car. However, I would sometimes see old-style (93-94) coupes with the two-tone paint job and not understand what they were actually made of.</p>
<p>Then this missing link showed up - a 94 Impreza <em>Sport</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/cfa393a0b5ec9c6cb2ff262411ec4ad0/tumblr_inline_n564a9siEi1ruuem1.jpg"/></p>

<p>See the two-tone paint job? I&rsquo;m thinking the &ldquo;Outback Sport&rdquo; trim is actually a reference to the &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; trim on the Imprezas, and not necessarily to the full-on Legacy Outback, since the Outback was never made available to the Japanese customer.</p>
<p>That would also explain the unique Outback Sport interior, badging and options, because SOA would have had to do final assembly of the car after importing it from Japan as a normal Impreza Sport to turn it into an Outback Sport. The strange coupes that I saw must have been a 93-94 &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; trim level on the Impreza L coupe, which would have caused the two-tone paint to be applied to the car as it is in this Sport-trim wagon.</p>
<p>The Impreza Sport also disappears from the catalogues after 95, because in 96 the Outback and Outback Sport appear, and there&rsquo;s a facelift. The two-tone paint is kept as an homage which says that Sport package cars with a two-tone paint job must exist in other regions than just North America (one such car is probably the Gravel Express, Japan&rsquo;s two-litre turbo version of the Outback Sport, with even more exotic interior and exterior trimmings).</p>
<p>Not sure how this explains the unique Outback Sport springs, but I&rsquo;m sure there was some catalogue trickery involved.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m getting ready to leave my house, right? And there&rsquo;s this dog here. Some kind of Afghan hound or some shit. Beautiful, meticulously groomed hair. On my lawn. Whose dog is this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh uh girlfriend, culottes are so 70s!&rdquo; she yells at me, but it is barely audible before it dissolves into the usual angry-dog hate stream of BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK</p>
<p>I return to the house, shaken. What just happened? Did I imagine that? I look out the peephole at the dog, still standing there on my lawn, now cocking her head to stare at a particularly savoury blade of grass next to my driveway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what culottes are. I check Simple English Wikipedia. That makes no sense. It bothers me. It&rsquo;s already a miracle that we have a talking dog who is smart enough to understand fashions and cultural norms. Why isn&rsquo;t this dog&rsquo;s angry fashion advice <em>accurate</em>?</p>
<p>I change into my best suit, and slip out the back door. Somehow, she is in my back yard as well, and the barking resumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IS THERE AN ANCIENT HOPLITE WARRIOR CONVENTION IN TOWN? BECAUSE YOU&rsquo;RE DRESSED LIKE HELEN OF YUCK.&rdquo; again the fizzling and BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.</p>
<p>My body, twisted in fear, leaps back into my house through a plate glass window. I am laced with wounds and lying on a pile of sharp glass, bleeding out. That&rsquo;s not important. I need to impress this dog.</p>
<p>I call the police. I think that their YMCA-style camp will distract the dog for long enough for me to escape to the house of someone with better fashion sense who can protect me.</p>
<p>Five minutes after the police hang up on me, laughing, I hear a rattling at the front door and then the sharp intake of breath. The hound has broken into my house and aimed her pointed criticism at me once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;M SERIOUS, GIRLFRIEND, YOU GOTTA FIND THE REST OF THE SPARTANS BECAUSE YOUR PHALANX IS SHOWING. SO AWFUL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late. The dog is on top of me now, her powerful jaws snapping at my neck and face in a display of territorial dominance. I can feel the end coming.</p>
<p>A gunshot rings out. The dog&rsquo;s breathing intensifies, gets choppier. I feel more warmth on my chest mingling with my existing burst arteries and grated skin.</p>
<p>As the dog slumps off my chest and collapses to the floor, I see in the door a man, silhouetted by the morning sunrise, clutching a smoking shotgun. <em>He&rsquo;s going to appreciate this tie</em>, I think.</p>

<H1>Speedline Spotters' Guide</H1>

<H1>The Big List Of Weird Third Gen Cavalier Facts</H1>
<p>I used to own an &lsquo;01 Cavalier. It was an experience which I am slowly recovering from, no thanks to you for asking.</p>
<p>Anyway it occurred to me (while complaining about the car over dinner to a friend) that there&rsquo;s a lot of really weird stuff going on in the Cavalier and nobody really wants to talk about it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a list of all the weird stuff I remember from my Cavalier.</p>
<ul><li>When they did the second version of the third gen Cavalier in 2000, they had to re-engineer the car for safety in order to get a <em>half-star</em> passenger side impact safety rating. The words &ldquo;elevated risk of pelvic injury&rdquo; got thrown around a lot in those heady times, to be fair.</li>
<li>The convertible Cavalier and Sunfire were converted by another company external to GM (ASC, who also did the convertible conversion for the <a href="http://www.dakotaconvertible.com/">Dakota convertible</a>). When the roof gets cut off the car gets super wobbly and they needed to restore chassis rigidity. They added strut tower bars to the front and rear, so at least the car is sort of braced. These strut tower bars serve as a cheap junkyard upgrade for your hardtop J-body.</li>
<li>GM adds and removes the power lock trunk and its corresponding opening button depending on what year of the car it is. For instance, MY2001 cars do not have it, while 2002 and 2000 do.</li>
<li>Inexplicably, the bolt pattern and centre bore are perfect for a 5x100 Impreza or WRX.</li>
<li>Both the passenger and driver front seats are pointed slightly inward at an angle, so when you are sitting in the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of the seat the steering wheel is actually slightly off to your right. A lot of people associate this feature with a mild subconscious discomfort and it probably doesn&rsquo;t help safety much that Cavalier drivers aren&rsquo;t encouraged to look forward.</li>
<li>Getrag didn&rsquo;t allow GM dealerships to rebuild the F23 manual transmission used in many Cavaliers, so you have to replace the entire transaxle as a unit if (for instance) the synchros fail.</li>
<li>The invoice price of a dual-airbag Cavalier lost GM between $500 and $1000 per unit, depending on reports.</li>
<li>Toyota released a version of the Cavalier in Japan known as the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%A8%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%90%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A8">Toyota Cavalier</a>. It even had a TRD body kit package which added Supra-like styling and eyebrows for the headlights.</li>
<li>A dealership-installed supercharger kit was briefly available for the Z24 even though the 2.2&rsquo;s lower compression ratio leads to better forced-induction potential.</li>
<li>The 2.2L Cavalier engine uses pushrods instead of overhead cams like the 2.4L. It was still sold until MY2003.</li>
<li>The third gen Cavalier has a lot of dead space up front between the radiator and the exhaust manifold. What was supposed to go there? A V6, which never materialized.</li>
<li>There are dozens of J-body models, such as the Cadillac Cimarron, Buick Skyhawk, Pontiac Sunbird, and the Vauxhall Cavalier.</li>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing every good software project needs, it&rsquo;s managers. Software developers have an innate love of being managed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why github repositories can&rsquo;t start without you getting at least two layers of managers, an HR person and four sales people. I myself have at least 30 of them per repo, and let me tell you, I&rsquo;ve never written better code.</p>

<H1>ezflash4 not being detected by DS/GBA</H1>
<p>So I bought an ezflash4 (to play GBA homebrew, shut up) and it didn&rsquo;t work. Not surprising since I&rsquo;m pretty sure the last time they sold these was in 2006 or so.</p>
<p>The DS lite would complain that no GBA cartridge was inserted, the GBA Micro would come up with a corrupted &ldquo;Nintendo&rdquo; logo and the GBA SP would pretend that nothing was inserted.</p>
<p>After enough futile attempts at booting the thing with the GBA SP while leaving the SP plugged in the damn thing fired right up and has been okay so far. I guess the internal battery discharges itself and requires either replacement or a charging by way of the GBA.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having this problem, put the cartridge in a GBA and plug the GBA in. Now if only I could find my GBA Micro power adapter&hellip;</p>

<p>I got this theory. My theory is that Java is the way it is to make outsourcing easier.</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<ul><li>The language is designed to prevent (for your safety) joy, spontaneity and creativity when writing code,</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s perfectly suited to writing assembly line bullshit with tons of repetition that is time-consuming to work on or update,</li>
<li>The runtime is slow as hell, setting a low expectation for performance that is easily met by unoptimized slapdash work on the application side,</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a language designed for people who aren&rsquo;t very good programmers but who can spend a long time writing code. Because their time is cheap. Because they&rsquo;re not paid very much.</li>
</ul><p>Well, now that we&rsquo;ve nailed that we can realize that life is too short to keep using it, right?</p>

<H1>The Flash Player Installer is a piece of shit</H1>
<p>Like many others, I anticipate the demise of Adobe Flash and all its related products. The thousands of &ldquo;developers&rdquo; who will be put out of a job by it becoming irrelevant will be more than offset by the gain in national GDP as a result of not having to deal with its fucking crashing and even shittier (un)installer.</p>
<p>Everyone who works at Adobe and deals with Flash should feel a deep, awe-inspiring level of shame that in lesser men would lead them to thoughts of socially endorsed suicide.</p>
<p>Today I started browsing around the Internet in my copy of Safari, at which point I was alerted that a Flash update is ready. This opened the Flash Player Installer, which does not at all match my Mac OS X install because the installer is, for some reason, developed with Adobe Air and needs to look like a retard&rsquo;s painting of an SR71 Blackbird using only half of the greys available in the Photoshop palette.</p>
<p>After asking me for my sudo password and forcing me to click through a few more screens to get to the meat of the problem, I hit a poorly designed screen. I will now spend more time talking about this screen than the whole of Adobe has spent thinking about it.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the installer was triggered from inside a browser, the installer demands that I now cease my web browsing and quit Safari as well as all other browsers on my Mac, including Chrome which (as far as I know) carries its own version of Flash and thus doesn&rsquo;t fall victim to Adobe&rsquo;s direct fuckery.</p>
<p>After I quit all of my browsers (which takes a few hours because I&rsquo;m watching Netflix which uses Silverlight) I return to the installer to see if the list of browsers I need to close has updated. I notice that it doesn&rsquo;t automatically update, and I have to click Retry. Continuing to look at the window I come from, I&rsquo;m confused at why the list of browsers hasn&rsquo;t updated to reflect the ones I&rsquo;ve closed!</p>
<p>Oh wait, there&rsquo;s a dialog box here - in the Mac OS X style instead of Retard Blackbird - that tells me that the list of open browsers has changed, and that I need to click OK to see the updated list. Why didn&rsquo;t you just fucking do it?</p>
<p>After really, fo realz, closing the last browser, I click Retry again and am immediately shuffled to the install progress bar. It asks me for my sudo password halfway through the install, which I provide <em>again</em>, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to have impacted the install&rsquo;s success at all as it continues even as I type my password.</p>
<p>At the end of the install, the installer asks me if I want to let Adobe handle my updates for me from now on. Like fuck I will.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s review my list of questions:</p>
<ol><li>Why in the shit is there a modal dialogue box there to <em>tell me what I just did</em>?</li>
<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t the window style change when I lose focus?</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t Flash update while a browser is running?</li>
<li>Why does Flash give a shit that Chrome, a browser which includes Flash as part of its normal update process, is open?</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t the installer just poll for open browsers occasionally, or even just poll when the window gains/loses focus?</li>
<li>Why did Adobe go to so much work adding a special UI to the installer (breaking multiple platform conventions such as how modal dialogue boxes are related to the parent window) only to use the system default dialogue box to convey the actually important information?</li>
<li>Why has Adobe not gone bankrupt yet with such bald-faced contempt for <em>actually doing a fucking job properly</em>?</li>
